1,Had a great time talking and eating with friends after Red Rock.  Had the BBQ Chicken Wrap with the salad and both were great!  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was because my Coors Light came out in a Tall Boy Can. But it was still good.  Sarah was our waitress and did a good job as well.
0,"Today at legacy urgent care I was appalled by the behavior of the front seat lady. She was rude to me and my mother. My mom called to pay my deductible, she slammed the phone down on her and she cursed under her breathe. Her name is Elizabeth. I have never been treated so horribly here, but she has always been a little rude, today just went too far."
1,I was in my cousins wedding that was held here along with the reception and after party. Everything was top notch. \nThe food was good but nothing that i would crave.
1,"Went to hash house again on our way out of town, after telling everyone I was with just how good the place was.  \nwhat was ordered: \n-Hash house quesadilla- Delicious and of course massive just like everything else.  \n-grilled portobello mushroom sandwich- good but lacked flavor...oh ya maybe because it was only a mushroom sandwich LOL but please note the person ordering was a vegetarian.\n-crispy cornmeal salmon sandwich- excellent, tender, flaky, slightly crispy, couldn't have done a salmon sandwich better.  super messy\n-and I think the last thing was some kind of scramble but don't quote me on that.\n\nI also ordered their Famous BLT bloody Mary, it had everything you need to recover from a weekend in Vegas.  Good bloody Mary mix, good vodka, salted rim on the glass, a nice juicy tomato, a piece of lettuce, a crispy bacon strip, pepper, Tabasco, and a piece of toast.  HAH absolutely GENIUS\n\nwent back home super full and satisfied."
1,"Took my sister and daughter here for lunch the other day...we really enjoyed it! My daughter got the homemade chicken noodle soup, it was really delicious. I got the reuben sandwich with fruit and my sister got the gyro sandwich...both were tasty and the fruit was really fresh.  The owner even came over to check on us and he was very gracious. They sell fresh baked bread in the bakery area, so I got a cinnamon swirl loaf to take home which made awesome french toast!  :)"
1,"If I could design the perfect all-around restaurant, this would be it! Casual, but not too much. Wide range of food: from wings, to burgers, steaks, salads, fish tacos, and a ton more. New and clean inside, with an awesome bar area as well as private tables. I also love their outdoor seating, both the front and back sides. I've been coming here for almost ten years now, and still love it. The perfect neighborhood restaurant, whether you want a full steak dinner, or just wings and beer with friends."
1,My husband and I really liked the revolving sushi concept. It was a great way to try different and new sushi for a very reasonable price. We had nine different items and already have several we want to try on our next visit. There's plenty of variety and it's perfect for trying new items.
0,"We went to the Downtown Las Vegas Events Center to see the Sammy Hagar show last month. The venue is in a great spot downtown that allowed for easy access to restaurants and bars which was great. I was a little skeptical about the sound quality and the comfort (crowd) but the place was actually pretty cool with excellent sound quality. There are also a very ample number of restrooms, which is a big problem at a number of other places. Unfortunately, the bad far outweighs the good with regards to the DLVEC.\n\n  We had tickets at will call and once we got to the window it still took about 20 minutes for the staff to find us on their list. I showed them the confirmation email on my phone, but they continued to search their obviously cumbersome and/or antiquated system of finding tickets. I wrote this off as first event bugs that needed to be worked out and we moved on. \n\n  The space is cavernous and while there are no seats in the GA area that's fine by me because who sits down at a good show, right? I will say that I'm glad we didn't pay for VIP seating. Most of the VIP area was significantly further away for the stage than we were in GA. The VIP tickets were about 2  1/2 times what we paid and that is hardly worth it just to have a chair.\n\n  The drink lines were by far the worst I've ever encountered at an event and that includes lines I've been in at NHL and MLB playoff games in packed stadiums. We were in line for over 1 hour and were basically forced to buy multiple drink as opposed to standing in line again. When we reached to front of the line we saw that there was a single bartender and one bar back at each of the two service areas. Given the price of the drinks they could have had 2 or 3 bartenders on each side and still raked in tens of thousands of dollars. I was nearly force to hit the PBR line which was significantly shorter. \n\n  My hope is that the folks that run the Downtown Las Vegas Events Center take a look at some of these reviews and take heed to the advice given. This venue has the potential to be a great place to see a show with a little fine tuning by the management. I'm hoping to be able to do a follow-up in the future that is more positive."
0,"Came here for lunch. Lady taking orders ignored us completely, talking to her friend about her kids. Had to actually interrupt them and ask to put in my order. Calamari was soggy and chewy.... disgusting. It took 40 minutes to get my pizza, had to go ask about its status and it was just sitting there ready to go but no one had delivered it to our table. Good pizza, nasty calamari, horrific service. Don't go during lunch time."
0,"TERRIBLE SERVICE!  A couple of our friends joined my wife and I to attend the Chandler Classic Car Show.  We have frequented Kokopelli Winery many times.  We were seated at the walk through patio area.  The hostess said our waitress would be with us shortly.  After waiting for 20 minutes, I went back to the hostess and told her we had not been waited on.  If they had been SWAMPED, I would understand but the place wasn't even 1/2 full.  She stated some one would be with us shortly.  We waited another 15 minutes and no one waited on us.  We walked out but at the front door on the way out, our \""supposed\"" waitress said she would buy the first round.  We said no thank you.  The hostess didn't even apologize.  I grabbed the business card for the manager ( Candice Oehlerking) and e-mailed her.  Didn't even get a response.  Guess they lost our business for good!!!"
1,I came back into town catching up with some girlfriends and decided to get our pedicures done. We happened to see this new place and it was beyond amazing! They owners was so nice and made our stay enjoyable. We will definitely be coming back soon!
1,"This place has good food!! I have been going here for years and I love that it is open late and located in a good area. I love their fried porkchops, special fried rice, porkchop combo, and of course their pho!! My favorite is their eggrolls! Theyre busy all day but especially late at night."
0,"This review is not about the food but about the hosts. We went in for an early dinner. As we arrived, we are told by the hostess that we cannot be seated inside since the place was booked by a very large group. I asked if there was a comfortable area outside since I was still cold from seating outside in the shade on a very windy day at Blue Martini. \n\nWe're told not to worry since we'd be sheltered from the wind. We get outside and we asked to sit at the only table located in the sun. \n\nAs we are looking at the menu and finally warm up, the hostess comes back to our table and asked us to move to another table in the shade since apparently, the table in the sun is going to be used by the big party. Which by the way, we have yet seen. \n\nWe decided to leave. Very unhappy. \n\nWe ended up going to Nu right downstairs and were seated on the patio right next to a very pretty and warm fire pit."
0,"I remember seeing this place on the Food Network and thought it would be pretty cool to go there. When I actually finally got to try it, I was disappointed. \n\nWhen you first go in, they put you in a scrub and it's mandatory. It was a little annoying because I had layers on because it was like 40 degrees outside and adding the scrub on top of my clothes was going to be restricting when I eat. I didn't even want to take my jacket off because I'd still be freezing. Plus it's a little annoying in general because it's so tedious and all you really wanna do is eat. \n\nLet me remind you that this is a themed restaurant. A medical/ hospital themed where the employees have a nurse uniform and a doctor uniform. And the setting of the place was new and interesting which is why gave it 2 stars. This place is more of an experience than it's food. \n\nNow the food.. The food was bland. Bland. Bland. It was not that great. I've had better burgers than that. The onion rings were the only flavorful thing they had. Though I did like their mango dreamsicle. They are pretty strict with their menu but the way it was setup was cool. You can't have this, you can't have that, we don't have this, we don't have that. Like my aunt asked for hot water because it helps with her stomach and our server was like, \""Nope! We have this water bottle.\"" I don't really know. I felt like our server was kinda rude anyways. I feel like the people work there think there think they're hot shit but I mean whatever I guess. Oh yeah. If you don't finish your food, you get spanked.\n\nOverall experience was okay. Ambiance was the only thing that gave this rating 2 stars. Like I said, food was bland. Workers were kinda annoying. And it's cash only. I felt like they did too much with this concept. It's not as great as it seems to be. I personally wouldn't want to eat here again unless I have people out of town coming here that wants to try it."
0,"DO NOT BOOK ADAM BROOKS AS YOUR WEDDING PHOTOGRAPHER!! We paid him in full because of a \""special\"" he was running. Our wedding is in 13 weeks, and we still have not heard a word from Adam. He has gone MIA with our money and it sounds like a lot of other people's money and pictures as well. Anyone who is filing a claim against him, please let me know. I would be more than happy to join! This guy needs to get caught."
0,"I pull up to the Unique Autowash and pay $21 dollars to get the car washed, towel dried ($2), and vacuumed ($6).   \n\nThe car runs through the autowash--it's nothing to write home about--and at the end, there are three teenagers drying and vacuuming.  Lackluster would be an overstatement.  One kid never took his eyes off his phone and texted the entire time.  The other two did a mediocre job vacuuming and barely dried the car.  There were streaks all over. Pathetic.\n\nI would have given the place two stars, but at that price point, it's verging on a rip-off.  Let me note that in both Chicago and San Diego, I got the same exact service for about $10 and they actually did a good job. \n\nMy car is still dirty.  Any recommendations out there?"
1,"Oh my gosh I love this place!  Totally laid back.  Sarrah, The owner has never met an enemy and if you want to talk, she has the most interesting stories to tell!  Of course she is busy slinging coffee much of the time.  This is truly what a coffee shop should be!  Come to the \""Friends\"" coffee shop in Charlotte.  You will be back that is for sure!"
1,"Thank you, Steve Wynn! Thank you for going vegan so that people like me can have a great meal. \n\nVegan Options - \n\nFlorentine Benedict - English muffin, sauteed spinach, and smokey tofu. The smokey flavor of the tofu makes this dish fabulous. \n\nWynn Double \""Cheese\""burger, Fries, and a Chocolate Shake - Sometimes you just want an indulgent meal without it feeling heavy on the stomach. This was so darn good! \n\nI will keep coming back here every time I go to Vegas!"
0,"Total and complete dump.  Bad food and bad surroundings.  The decent servers and chefs are what make me feel bad about the rating, but I'm all about the food."
1,"Aloha Snow is honestly my new favorite place in Charlotte - it may be a drive from Uptown, but what a welcomed experience. \n\nThe owner is standing behind the counter ready to serve you with not only a smile but a story - she is so full of joy that you will leave happy even if you left empty handed...BUT you won't - you will leave with the best snow cone in Charlotte and a broad smile across your face to wear the whole way home!\n\nI had cake batter and home made ice cream in my stuffed snowball - it was seriously amazing! You have to check this place out - you will want to return again and again!"
0,"I am solely basing this review on the fact that the restaurant advertises themselves as a gastropub..... We drove 30 min off the strip to come here because it had great reviews, and were told we couldn't stay because we had our son with us and the establishment is 21 and over!! If that's the case advertise that on yelp and your website, and don't call yourself a gastropub as authentic gastropubs are kid friendly! My son has a very adventurous appetite and it's very upsetting we wasted our time to try and come here when it is so simple to let it be known NO KIDS ALLOWED!!!!"
0,"I posted this on US Airways but since you merged I figured it was deserved on all your pages.\n\nSharing my experience. My flight from San Francisco to Phoenix was 35 minutes behind schedule.However I was fortunate (or maybe unfortunate) to have a 1 hour and 10 minute layover in Phoenix. Not sure what happened but when arriving in Phoenix I only had 24 minutes to get to my next gate by the time started deboarding it took about 10 minutes for the plane to deboard enough to get to me and the door. As soon as I got off I ran from A25 to B2. I'm a pretty good runner and I was able to run on the fast walkways which helped. I literally got to the gate at 8:01pm and the plane leaves at 8:10pm. As soon as I ran up they pointed me at another lady and said go talk to customer service and pointed a little aimlessly to who I thought was another lady that was going to get me on my flight. I asked the other lady who I thought I was being directed to if she was customer service, she said no customer service is around the corner. I had a sinking feeling at this point. I waited in line behind two other people and was up to the desk in a few minutes as it was 8:05pm by this time. Customer service said they could not let me on the plane. No other flights that US Airways could work with and they had none for the night. I am stuck in Phoenix for the night. They did give me a hotel, but my clothes were checked in complementary checking as they ran out of overhead space on the previous flight. A couple of things that could have been done very different, as well as impacts to my life.\n\n1. Typically when flights are behind the airline asks that anyone having a tight connecting flight be allowed to deboard first.\n2. A minute late to the gate seems ridiculous to not allow me on. Maybe you boarded quicker than expected but you knew I was coming I would have expected you to accommodate me especially when you are the same airline that screwed up in the first place.\n3. I don't have any clothes to wear tonight so I'll be in my work clothes, and have to get up early to fly back to SLC in my same clothes. It would be nice if you had a complimentary kit for me even a long t-shirt or something that I could use.\n4. I was told well at least you get a free breakfast at the hotel. Nice looking at the positive until i get to the hotel and find out my flight leaves to early for me to enjoy the breakfast. It seems like it just keeps piling on.\n5. My family was sad I have two little children at home and they are sad that their daddy was coming home like they thought. My wife also said she was sad but she likely is happy she get s a big bed to herself.\n6. We had to interrupt my job I will miss out on two key meetings one internal and one with a client.\n7. It will interrupt my wifes work to allow for this flight delay. I miss out on half a day of work time, and my wife now has to miss work time to come get me. I did ask the customer service rep how that works and she says well we don;t offer a service so you can pay for a cab and then call customer service and see if they can do anything. That comment didn't instill any confidence especially when the results from this company have shown that I shouldn't trust them.\n\nIf the Airline would like to reach out to me feel free. I would like to see how we can change this post into a more positive one but I will leave it unchanged until you contact me."
0,so I took my dog here 2 or 3 times for lumps that showed up on her because it was close to me and and they got good reviews however they were horrible they talked surgery to remove and even did a syringe to drain one and said that it wasn't infected with puss or anything just clear liquid and blood put her on a antibiotic and said well her white blood cell count is elevated but probably do to this lump then went back again for more lumps and they talked about surgery and removing them without doing any blood work oh and giving me shit about not fixing her long story short took her to s different vet and was diagnosed with valley fever now why would a vet not test for this right away since were in az and i even thought valley fever i had a friend that got nochels from it so if i had not taken her here i could have started treatment a lot sooner i would go somewhere else doctor ford at arizona animal wellness is great
1,"Oxtail chili fries ftw. The truffle fries are not very truffle-y. Had better at I Love Burger, Gordon Ramsay Burgr, and Guy Fieri's. They're covered in a mushroom sauce that's tasty, but I'd call them creamy mushroom fries, not truffle fries."
1,It's crazy as a Bay Area resident it took me being in Tempe to try Ikes. All the raving is totally justified. There are so many options and creative sandwiches on the menu. I loved the San Francisco theme to it and the dutch crunch bread was like a little taste of home. I ordered the Michael Jordan (basically a meatball sub) and seriously cannot say anything bad about it. My boyfriend ordered the Matt Cain which was also delicious. Best sandwich spot I've had in the desert and maybe even ever. Can't wait to try more choices on the menu
0,This place was terrible. The pictures I saw on yelp did not match what was on the menu and the staff was awful. To top it off screaming kids and you can't even have a mimosa with your brunch.
1,Seriously good cupcakes with creative choices. I recommend the boston cream or the southern bell (red velvet). The woman who helped me was super friendly.
1,"Great place to get a quick bite on the run. I usually get their Vito sandwich which is their version of Italian with Genoa salami, capicola, provolone, lettuce, tomato, onions & vinaigrette. $4.95 for 8\"" sub isn't a bad deal, specially with fresh ingredients. Give it a try. \n\nOverall (4/5)"
1,"How I love me a pool party in Sin City.  Of course, they're even more epic when DJ'd by Aoki and you get free admission for your group of eight girls.  Wet Republic is definitely one of the best things about the MGM, and you could find us there every day of our trip to Vegas.  We were super lucky for our trip in May, as Vegas was 70-80 degrees and actually manageable for a day in the sun.  Man, it's fun to check out everyone at the pool, get some sun, and spend way too much money on drinks ($35 for about a liter of alcoholic slush!).  Bartenders were nice, dancing was hot, and the crowd was great!  It was hilarious seeing all the men in the pool go crazy with the splashing when the music sped up.  Seems like enough alcohol brings out the kid in everyone...\n\nMy only recommendation is to avoid the pool, if possible, as I'm pretty sure the reason it's temperature was higher than the air was not just due to the number of bodies in there... plus, we saw quite a few people getting kicked out for making out in there- with and sans bathing suits!  Eeek!  I don't know if they make enough chlorine for that..."
0,"I used to love this place. But it seems that service is getting worse and worse by the day.. \nThere's one chef that seems to have an attitude every time I see him (chubby with glasses). \nThey take forever to make your order & when you order too much, they don't serve it.. \nOnly good thing about this place is the fact that you can order more than 1 uni sashimi at this place."
1,"Quaker Steak & Lube was my go-to place for wings in Madison. I'll admit, I never had anything other than wings here, and that would continue to be the trend whenever I'm back in the area.\n\nIf you're up for it, Tuesdays are the days to go here. $13 for all-you-can-eat wings and I must praise the wings for their quality. I love how Quaker Steak & Lube has a lot of flavors and seasonings for their wings. I'd say between 20-25. I believe they implemented new dry rubs within the past year or so and they were pretty good.\n\nOverall, superior wings and good atmosphere, bar, and lots of TVs."
0,"While the staff is pretty friendly here, there is NO need to have a drive thru (with at least 15 cars blocking the parking lot) in a state that has 120 degree heat.  I'm pretty sure Arizona & Starbucks are doing their share to contribute to global warming."
0,The worst cafe food in Las Vegas. Seriously! $5 for a baked potato that has been sitting all day and barely reheated. The inside was light brown...possibly cooked the day before. The pork fried rice obviously had suggest in it. Steve's blood sugar skyrocketed to almost 300 after eating 1/4 of a bowl. I tasted it and told him to stop eating it immediately. I could taste the sugar. $40 later for rice and a potato.
0,Was here with my wife for lunch. Was seated and served very quickly. We both ordered the lunch special salad and wings. Salad was a joke. Lettuce with cheese and tomatoes. That's it. We had the chicken stripper which was deep fried chicken strips with sauce. Not very good. Waitress was good but I can't recommend this place.
0,"HORRIBLE!   Pretentious, over-priced, poor quality food, terrible service.  Complete waste of money.  \n\nWhen I went with three friends the other night - we were greeted by no fewer than six people at the front.  The \""manager's\"" are walking around this Mastro's copy... with earpieces like they are at some fancy club in NYC or Vegas.  They are useless.  We waited almost an hour to place our order.  The food and service would have been better at ANY Chipotle Grill.  \n\nAlso... the music!!  Hello??  80's rock with lyrics in a fine dining room?  \n\nDo NOT GO!!  Atrocious!!"
1,"Went to Sala Thai two nights ago, was very busy but received our appetizers in a short amount of time and entrees commensurate.  Small restaurants like this keep their costs down by mostly family running the place, so when we have been there, there has been momma cooking in the kitchen and daughter tending the front of the house.  Two people can only do so much so fast.\n\nWe have had Pad Thai in many places around Madison but we think this is the best, with the right noodles and sauce the limes, not lemons.  \n\nThe Vietnamese Egg Rolls were crispy and seemed fresh made and the peanut sauce was the perfect compliment.  \n\nThis time, I had the Curry Combo, which had potatoes, pineapple, green beans, pork, shrimp and chicken.  This had a red curry sauce that had just the right amount of heat for me.  Lots of pork and a good number of whole shrimp (watch for the ail shells which were still on) but I didn't find anything that seemed like chicken (though it may have had a similar texture to the pork).\n\nA very pleasant meal once again and a great place to go back.  The waitress remembers us every time."
1,"Awesome food, awesome service. The best way to do teppanyaki without breaking the bank or having to drive down to the strip. We have been here many times for birthdays, Mother's Day, etc. I highly recommend Eddy!"
0,"DEFINITELY DON'T GO!\n\n\nTo be honest, 1Oak is ok.  I think the best part of the night was when we (3 girls) were escorted into the club without waiting in line and receiving drink tickets.  My girls and I stayed for approximately one hour before leaving and heading over to Marquee.  \n\nThe crowd was on the older side.  I am almost hitting my 30's but I felt like I was the youngest in the club.  We even saw an older lady around her 60's walking around the club.  Not to be mean, but the crowd was on the ugly side.  I'm not saying I'm pretty but I would like to look at some good-looking people.  \n\nThe music was mediocre as well.  There were some old school hip-hop, but it was just a mix of EDM with hip-hop and some weird mixes.  Not my thing.\n\nOh, and here's the kicker:  The bartender would not give us regular tap water.  If we wanted water, we would have to pay $8.35 for a bottle of water.  Um ... no thank you.  That really turned us off.   Plus, what I cannot understand is where did the cents come from?!  I thought bars charge an even price so what's up with the 35 cents?  \n\nYeah, I don't think I'll ever go back to 1Oak.  I cannot wait for Hakkasan to be open at MGM in April."
1,"Mon Ami Gabi is one of my favorite places in Vegas. I go there every time I visit. \nLast visit wasn't as great because the food wasn't as well-prepared as I'm accustomed to there, but maybe it was an off night. That night was also too loud and crowded to hear the music from the Bellagio fountains that I usually enjoy from the outdoor patio area. Regardless, I will be back!\nThe service was great from our Rhode Island born and raised server! :-)"
1,"We've used This company in the past and were totally satisfied.  So when my husband took  a shower in the master tub last night and the tub filled with water that wouldn't drain, and the guest bathroom tub almost overflowed....he called Vegas Plumbing again.  The house is old!  My husband and I were stressed out over our plumbing situation and thinking we would have to break out our piggy bank and then some didn't help.  My husband had to go to work and didn't like the idea of me having to deal with this alone either.  He called around 12:30 or 1:00 p.m. and the office said someone would be at our house between 2 and 5 p.m.   So right around 1:45 p.m. the doorbell rings and Carl the plumber is here.  That is fast service!  Carl worked very hard snaking the tub and checked all my concerns regarding the problem and answered any questions I had.  Carl was very nice and courteous and didn't treat me as the \""airhead\"" wife, he explained exactly what was going on...very professional.  He even cleaned the tub and area in which he worked.   I held my breath as I asked to see the bill and was able to exhale as it was a very fair price for all the hard work.  I hope I won't have to call again....but if I do it will be to Vegas Plumbing and I can highly recommend them."
0,"Horrible dentist! My first visit so I filled out forms , which I hate, and I put a line through all the no's on oart of the health section. Well he didn't like that and came out smacking his gum and asked if I was having a bad day... I said no why? He says I must be by the way I filled out the form so I said not at all are you? Bottom line he continued to harp on it and I said forget this... And left! Seriously? No wonder he has bad ratings! What a jerk!!!\n1 review that is not currently recommended"
1,"Wow. Ate here while staying at the Boulders. Great food. Everything we ate was amazing. Food was on the spicy side which I enjoyed! House margarita was one of the best I've had,Very fresh! I highly recommend the pulled pork sandwich on the pretzel bun. We were here during off season do there was no wait."
0,My daily routine is to drive to Starbucks to work everyday. I usually go to the one on towns center and charleston. I happened to stop by this one 2day and waited 25 min @ the drive thru before I got my drink. Not even an apology or comp drink. Horrible customer service!
0,Burgers are just OK. Ice cream was very good but I'm not sure that all their ingredients are very fresh? Some pieces tasted a bit off. Probably won't come back here again.
1,"This place is ah-mazing.  It's a family-owned business and they came from LA to Arizona to setup shop.  \n\nThe sushi is so yummy.  We had Toro and a rainbow roll.  The quality of fish is excellent.  I also had the udon noodle soup which I split with my mom.  It was the perfect accompaniment to a chilly winter day.  You can split it easily, and they bring you the bowls and spoons to do so.  It even has a soft boiled egg in it! Yummy\n\nThe menu has more than standard rolls, there are a lot of fusion rolls to choose from!\n\nThey also had hot green tea that was so good.\n\nThis place is intimate and welcoming, definitely worth becoming a regular at!"
1,"Discovered this place using Yelp.  We were looking for authentic Mexican food close to our hotel.  Ratings were great, so we went. Unbelievably good!  Excellent salsa!  Margaritas were the best we have ever had!  This is now one of our top stops on our yearly trip!"
0,"Ordered Steak and Blue salad--definitely not impressed and don't recommend.  Tasteless with ground up steak bits, barely recognizable as meat."
0,"I came here for lunch...service line is in the back so you have to walk around the dining area or cut people off in line to \""start\"". I had to re-direct a couple people who came in after me. Service was also really slow and the meat slicer was spitting out meat across the counter. Then, while one of the staff was making my sandwich, there was a disgusting guy who literally came in, cut me off in line, proceeded to the cash register and demanded change for the bus (mind you he didn't order food but would \""think about it\""). Staff didn't say anything since he wasn't ordering a sandwich...rude much?! I get to the cash register and she asked if I wanted to leave a tip...for what?! Crappy service, rude patrons and mediocre food? No thanks! Needless to say, I won't be back."
1,"I had a groupon for colon hydrotherapy, and my experience was good. There are a lot of negative reviews for this place at their old address, so to their credit I wanted to tell my experience.  After making my appointments, I got follow up confirmations via email. These emails said no food at least two hours before the appointment.  I also got reminder emails right before my appointment. When I got there, the office was small but clean and quiet, New-age music in the background.  The therapist was extremely informative and kind. I was told up front that one appointment wouldn't take care of my problems, but it would take several. I already knew and understood that, don't expect to get totally cleaned out with one or even two visits.  They even gave me a dvd to take home.  The only reason I didn't do 5 stars is because it was kind of a hassle getting the appointments. No one ever answered the phone when I first called.  I had to leave a message and it took them about 4 days to get back to me. But once I got in they treated me great and even spared me my dignity. I will go back for sure."
1,Great food! Friendly staff!
0,"We had delivery - the order was messed up and it took forever. Later on they realized they didn't charge my card, but charged a different customer twice and needed me to provide my credit card information again\n\nI wasn't thrilled after having waited so long for my food.\n\nAs far as the food itself, I wasn't in love with it. The generals chicken was soggy and chewy - not the crispier spicy chicken I was hoping for."
1,"Amaaaaazing food! Get the cheese plate, the flat breads, and a fancy drink. Love it!"
0,"This review is on their customer service, specifically towards concierge and security-lost and found.\n\nI had left my ipad charger and realized it shortly after I checked out.\nI went back to the hotel and the concierge had confirmed with me that housekeeping retrieved it but it will take couple hours to get it to lost and found.\nI had to leave Vegas so she took down my number and told me security will contact me and it will be mailed to me, free of charge.\n\nAfter not hearing back from them for a week, I called and now the security tells me nothing was retrieved from the room. but I was specifically told that it had been before. He told me a person will be contacting me to start an inquiry/investigation on it on that day.\n\nOf course not to my surprise, I dont hear from them so I call back again 3 days later and now the lady in security is telling me she does not know of such procedure of starting investigation and maybe i should try calling back to speak to that guy again....\n\nplease get your act together Aria in your service area. \nIts not about the charger. it's about being told one thing and then another the next. and then no follow up. and it's a shame because your rooms and casinos are nice. especially for the price."
1,"I have read many unfair reviews of this restaurant. It appears many people are attempting to \""double dip\"". If you buy a groupon, don't be a cheapo and expect that the sushi half off will apply to you and then you can also get to apply your groupon. How do you expect these people to live? \nOutside of the misers that are reviewing this restaurant everybody should know the following:\n1) The sushi is amazing. I have seen some really innovative stuff.\n2) The owners are amazing. They are super friendly and, if you have children, they are kind to your children. It is not every day that you find that in a sushi restaurant. \n3) They will accommodate you. If you are a sushi fanatic like myself and like something that is not on the menu, ask and you shall receive.\nAll of these reasons combine to make this my FAVORITE sushi place in Phoenix."
0,"This place sucks!!!  If you're not \""beautiful\"", vain, and stuck up, don't waste your time going here.  The drinks are super small, super weak, and super expensive.  That's after you fight the crowd to get to the bartender, who then seems to ignore you for 20 minutes before you can order your drinks.  After 1 round, I threw my empty glass on the ground, it broke, and we got the hell out of there just as we heard security being called!!!  I was so angry I wasted my money on that garbage."
1,"Have I mentioned that it's great to have a real vegetarian restaurant in C-U?? We go to the Red Herring at least once a week for lunch. It's easy to get to, the food is good (though it can be a bit hit or miss depending on the cooks who are on call during the semester), the atmosphere is fun and relaxed, and the portions are perfect. If you haven't checked it out, you should. If you haven't been back in awhile: go!"
0,"Platos closet in Scottsdale needs to hire more mature, educated people. These girls that go through the clothes are idiotic. They barely look through anything and decline most of it. All of the things I brought in (7 grocery bags full, organized by item) were recent, trendy, lightly worn items. I saw many things in the store that were similar and even more that were in worse quality/out of style. When you go to sell they seem angry that they have to work and are just messing around like kids while people shop.. Very unimpressed. Before this store moved to this location it was much better!"
1,"We moved yet again and called Just In Time again since we had such an easy and stress free move the last time. This time we were moving from Ahwatukee to Tempe. How long do you think a NORMAL moving company would take? 5 to pack up, drive over, unload, set up....?\n\nJust in Time took two hours from door to door. I literally could not believe how fast they were. Nothing was broken. Nothing but courtesy and politeness. Nothing but a great deal and stress free move!!!!\n\nI just found out my new neighbor is moving and referred them just as I would refer to you!!!"
1,"Went here a few weeks ago for brunch. I will say that I am still a fan of Z Tejas but I think I just ordered the wrong thing. I had the potato hash and eggs which was ok but it seemed like it needed something more flavor wise. Maybe a little more sauce on top would have made it better. Also, since I was sick, I ordered the tortilla soup. It was a thick soup and I actually prefer brothier tortilla soups. Wasn't bad though. As always, the cornbread was phenomenal. I also had a red sangria and it was delicious and refreshing. My companion said that she loved her burger and fries. I still love Z Tejas but I will probably just go for dinner there from here on out since that is where they really shine."
1,Lovely big branch. I think this was their first store.\nSo many yummy things that just happen to be healthy/ ethical to boot.
1,"I'm in love with this place. It's just got amazing energy. Great music, good (although expensive) drinks, good people, go-go dancers, crazy light show, etc.\n\nI started out with a Beer which I believe was $6, and then switched to mixed drinks which were $11. On my second vodka Redbul I asked for double and the bar tender gave it to me for the same $11 price as the single so that was sweet. Also had a great gin and tonic. Service is slow though, lots of folks and the bar tenders aren't in a rush. They are however pretty nice once they get around to you. The place is filled with chairs and couches, but people also kinda get up and dance in the empty space (although there is no real dance floor). I actually found that somewhat appealing, it takes what little formality there is in club dancing and makes it completely casual. Most folks were in club attire (dressed and button up shirts), but there were a few folks dressed down a bit and that didn't seem to be a problem (there is no bouncer). The music that night was also super dope. Chris Cutz was in from San Diego and absolutely melted faces. Right song at the right time every time, lots of bass, and hard beats. Their sound system in general is of pretty good quality."
1,"Was there this past weekend for a drink and some munchies. Love the atmosphere, awesome music, nicely surprised. Too bad the pation wasn't open :(\n\nWe had a couple of pitchers of bourbon lemonade. It was a beautiful day so this really quenched my thirst. We had the popcorn shrimp and frito-lay pie to nibble on. The pie was decent, and the shrimp were addictive! Almost had a sweet and sour taste to them. \n\nI was checking out other folks and their dishes, the fried chicken and ribs looked awesome. Nice and messy! Will definitely be back for a meal.\n\nWas a little on the pricey side, but worth it if you want a little treat."
1,First time coming here.  Just got the standard $5 wash (it's $3 Monday - Friday).  Pretty decent job for a quick automated wash.  Didn't use the vacuums this time but will in the future!!
0,"Product is good as always. But the service was horrible. Toppings needed to be refilled. Tables were dirty. The person at the counter looked like she had no desire to work there. She was standing there doing nothing, didn't greet anyone or offer samples. She didn't even know how to work the rewards system when I gave her my rewards card. She argued with me when I said I had three 4oz rewards and I had to use my app to prove it to her. She obviously wasn't properly register trained. Makes me glad I have an excellent Yogurtland that provides excellent service back home."
0,The service here is terrible.  The place was empty.  We waited for fifteen minutes or more.  I finally asked if we could be seated in one of the many empty tables.  The answer was we do not have enough servers to seat you.  We sat another ten minutes and finally gave up and left.  Maybe they should hire a few more waitresses.  These people did not care one bit if you waited forever.  The worst part was only a very few tables had customers.  This is the only complaint I have ever written.  I will never return to this restaurant!
0,"Stopped here for lunch with my BFF today.\n\nNowhere to park, forced to valet, meh...\n\nLove the atmosphere here: classy decor, beautiful patio. Everything on the menu looked delicious. I had a hard time choosing between many foods that I love: crab cakes, goat cheese, crepes... I wanted something lighter so I ordered the oriental chicken salad. In the meantime, our drinks were brought to the table. BFF pulled the spoon out of her iced tea to find that there was some leftover peanut butter still on it. The question is: who left it there? Don't know. Gross. This was pointed out to a server (not ours because she had not returned to our table). Our server brought out a new iced tea. She was polite, but not necessarily apologetic. \n\nWhen our meal was delivered to the table, BFF pointed out that there were tomatoes on her sandwich (she asked for no tomatoes). The server said that the other server probably grabbed the wrong plate. She came back from the kitchen twice to tell us that the new sandwich would be right out. So, I sat with my salad and waited to eat until BFF got her meal (It took a good 5-10 minutes for her new sandwich to come out). \n\nBFF raved about the dressing on her side salad. My salad was fine, but nothing to rave about (especially not for $13). The ingredients were fresh but the \""shredded chicken\"" that was described on the menu appeared to be sliced chicken breast. To be honest, I prefer shredded chicken which is why I had decided on that particular salad. DISAPPOINTING.\n\nThe server arrived at the table to ask if we wanted to order dessert. We replied, \""no, thank you\"". And she said something like, \""oh, come on, are you sure?\"". Again, we declined but I really think she should have offered us free dessert after our bummer lunch.\n\nThe topper? 1 valet guy and 6 people in line to pick up their cars=a 10 minute wait just to leave the place. \n\nI would hesitate to come back, but that menu is just so damn tempting."
0,"The problem I have this experience compared to my last is that the examination lasted 3 minutes.  The vet checked the ears, teeth, and nails then called it a day.  \n\nI came home looked at his teeth and saw my pup had a \""slab fracture\""  which was still attached to the gum.  The vet didn't mentioned it during the \""exam\"" other than telling me to buy a finger brush to brush his teeth.\n\nI was primarily there for a vaccination shot but if they're going to charge me for a examination, they should do a proper examination.  I just felt I was rushed out of there. \n\nI took my dog to another vet where they told me about the slab fracture, gave me info on how it usually happens, potential problems that it can cause, and recommendations on ways to fix the problem."
0,"Went to Happy Hour here with a friend yesterday.  I had heard it is one of best places for happy hour downtown.  We were seated and given water promptly.  I asked a staff person what was featured for happy hour.  She said that happy hour is only available \""at the bar and on the tile floor.\"" and walked away.  Whoops, we were on carpet.  ...and she didn't answer my question.  \n\nWe asked to be reseated (on the TILE FLOOR), which our server did quickly and graciously.  The happy hour food is \""half price plus a dollar\"" which feels like they are nickel and diming me, so I didn't get food.  We ordered wine, which turned out to be $7 each.  More than we expected as we understood happy hour wines were $4, but definitely not outrageous.  An observation from our table on the tile floor near the window was that a party seated outdoors waited so long for service that they left.  \n\nAll I did was drink wine.  And I liked it.  But I can't comment on the food.  I don't think I'll go back because this experience was pretty poor."
1,"First and most importantly, this place has excellent, fresh sushi.  Tried the albacore sashimi, uni, salmon sashimi in a salad with truffle oil, vegas roll, and seaweed salad.  Only disappointing dish was the uni.  The rest were superb.  Total bill was under $75 including tip and 5 drinks (most everything was happy hour priced).  Friendly service at the sushi bar and a fun atmosphere.  Good date place."
0,Awful! Went in for a gel manicure three days later three nails have polish completely peeled off. Not only that but while there I had to tell the nail tech to do the design I wanted 5 times and she still forgot when I reminded them again someone came in and did the design and it was crooked! I ended up having to go home and clean around my cuticles with all the over spill and I have a hang nail on my pinky now. Worst and I mean WORST! Gel I've ever gotten. I went to this place for convenience and I will make the extra few minute drive to pretty nails in Goodyear.
1,"This place is great.  The best thing on the menu is the mac and cheese.  It's baked and rich and aboot the best mac and cheese I've ever eaten.  All three chicken styles are great my personal choice is baked, with wasabi cream dipping sauce and sweet chili sauce.  The staff is wonderful, Jin who is always there at the counter is always friendly.  This is great comfort food with a reasonable price, and a kind staff. Eat here, or else."
0,"I'll happily wait (nearly) an indefinite amount of time for a table at a great restaurant. I'll tolerate poor service, to an extent. I realize people get busy, get distracted, and generally have bad days. I understand all of that, within reason. But let's paint the scene for Ha Long Bay tonight (and quite honestly, most other nights, albeit with slight variances)...\n\n8pm, slammed busy. Zero waiting space. Loud. Cramped. Hectic. People bumping into one another; servers bumping into people. \n\nNames are given with the hope of getting a table. Hostess could care less. Grumbles something about a wait. No drinks offered while waiting, although it's not like they have a vast selection or offer any room to imbibe while suffering through the wait.\n\nTable becomes ready, but don't get your hopes up... It'll be another 10+ minutes before a \""server\"" shows up. Our server on this particular night was a bearded gentleman with a chip on his shoulder that was bigger and more full than his Duck Dynasty wannabe scraggly beard could ever hope to be. \n\nHe literally slammed waters on the table and asked if we wanted anything else. I ordered a single hopalicious, while extending a smile and a sincere thank you. Nothing. Just a quick turn and departure.\n\nThat would be ok if he were on a mission to fill the requested beer. But it was another 10 minutes before he returned. He had the beer, and then asked what we wanted for food. We ordered two appetizers, which he struggled with - the notion of getting the \""pork AND shrimp spring roll\"" apparently too much to handle... He wrapped up the order with a, \""so, just appetizers?\"" and an eye roll upon our confirmation.\n\n20 minutes later, we had our appetizers and more attitude when we requested a refill on the beer. We never saw said server again, save for a fling of the check at us. \n\nSo... Crappy service, cramped interior, slow kitchen, and mediocre food... I will order takeout, but I'll be hard pressed to dine in again. It's just not worth the frustration."
0,"Well, you would think that I would learn my lesson.  I should NOT be doing anything before reading the reviews on Yelp first!  \n\nWe had friends in from out of town over the holidays, and we thought we'd take them to see some of the \""old west\"" and have some fun.  \n\nSadly, it ended up being pretty lame to be brutally honest.  We did have some fun having our husbands arrested, and they had some fun drinking a whiskey at the saloon, but other than that, Rawhide is definitely meant for kids.  EXCEPT for the super strong margaritas at the Margarita Bar.  ;)\n\nUnless you're taking kids, skip Rawhide and take your out of towners to Goldfield Ghost Town in AJ instead."
0,"so this seems to be a popular place in charlotte, but i was a bit underwhelmed by my whole experience here.\n\nfirst off, we were the only ones in the restaurant on a weekday night. no one else showed up for a half hour, and it seemed that the waitress had better things to do than check up on us in a more timely manner. she wasn't mean or rude, but she almost seemed uninterested in serving us by how she approached and left our table. maybe i was reading too much into it, but i found it odd. perhaps, she was just trying to give us our space and not \""smother\"" us. i don't know. she really could have talked up the menu or been more into asking us what we needed/wanted.\n\nmy husband and i shared the house salad, the fish and chips and the infamous bananas foster crepe for dessert. house salad tasted good, but the dressing was overpoweringly garlicky. i could only eat half of it, because it was so strong. normally, i would have eaten it all myself--because, c'mon. it's just salad. the fish was actually perfect. nice crispy breading with a tender, moist fish in the middle. not too much batter, and no fish taste. just fresh and delicious. the tartar sauce was good, but not amazing. and the fries were a little too salty. they were cooked well. just too much sodium chloride.\n\nand then--AND THEN--the bananas foster crepe. everyone here has raved about this crepe, so i decided we should try it. umm...maybe we went to the restaurant when everyone that worked there was having an off-day, but i thought it was totally boring. i was expecting something amazing, and i couldn't have been more sleepy about it. i've had better crepes at a friend's house, who had only learned to make crepes the same day we went over. it wasn't gross or anything. i guess there was just so much hype for me that i thought there would be more to it. \n\nsorry crepe cellar. while i'm glad i went to experience it, i don't know that i will go back. first impressions sort of mean a lot to me. and, i don't want to fall asleep at the table."
1,Great gardens!  I honestly can't wait until I go again.  The rooms are divided by climate and location.  They have a great bonzai and orchid collection.  Make sure you check out the butterfly room!
0,Service looks like has gone way down from when first opened. Not worth the prices for how you get treated!!
1,"I've eaten here about three times now, and I have to say I'm a fan. I've eaten at their location in Gilbert several times before, so I knew what to expect when walking in.\n\nThe place is colorfully decorated, with different colored tables and chairs of all sizes for seating.  Their food is cooked fresh, they will make what you want to order on or off the menu.  I usually go with the shredded beef taco with some kind of beans and rice.  This is a hearty meal, and let me tell you, its filling and delicious. I love their shredded beef, as its really moist and juicy. Their tortilla's are made fresh by hand, and you can watch them  make it as your standing in line.\n\nOverall I love this place, but at times, I feel rushed through line. I also have a hard time hearing the guys behind the counter when they ask me stuff like what I want on my taco.  Honestly, I know my hearing is good, so I think its the noise from behind the counter that drowns them out.  I have to ask them a lot to repeat themselves, and its not that they aren't loud enough....but in between the glass that's separating you and the noise from the kitchen, I have to keep saying \""HUH? ONE MORE TIME PLEASE.\""\n\nAlso, sometimes i feel rushed at the register when i pay. I take my time and put my money back in my wallet and make sure I have everything before I take my tray, and sometimes I feel like they want me to hurry up so they can keep the line down, and not have it pile up.  (I know, fussy, right?)  LOL\n\nOverall, I love their food here and I really enjoy eating here. I plan on coming back in the future to eat more, and even though its on the pricier size, I'm definitely a fan!"
0,"Every year we choose a different hotel to stay at during our visit to Vegas, unfortunately we chose Flamingo. We stayed at the Flamingo three nights in august and the hotel gave us one of there remodeled rooms on the 25th floor. Im not going to complain the rooms were very nice (modern) the bathroom was very spacious, but the bathroom door was a sliding door that did not lock so if your sharing a room you have to make sure there is no one in the bathroom. The flamingo pool is ok, they have a pool for kids which has a slide and a pool for 21+ which has a cave (GO Pool) while in the GO pool I saw vomit in the pool and a man hurl while he was walking through which I considered a huge health hazard! The flamingo food court was under remodeling so the only thing open was the caf\u00e9 which didn't really have much and closed early. My biggest pet peeve with this hotel was the parking!!!! the first two floors are valet parking and the third floor was only for Hertz rental cars, we spent an hour looking for parking till we finally gave up and decided to go to the valet, once were down there's a sign that said valet parking full! How is this possible the Wynn hotel has there own staff parking and yet guests at the flamingo don't have a place to park there car! The parking lot at the flamingo is just disgusting, no parking, the elevator gets stuck at times so you have to carry your heavy luggage down flights of stairs, just terrible! Either they remodel the entire place or tear it down because that kind of hotel does not belong on the strip."
0,"Went for late lunch.\nString beans with XO sauce were great, so were the Penang noodles with shrimp. Good service (restaurant was nearly empty).\nThis was a four star experience.\nWent back two days later for dinner.\nWas it the same restaurant? ... soggy string beans ... e-fu noodles with crab (hunt the crab). Chilean sea bass was good. Service was slow.\nTwo stars my Chinese wife was unhappy"
0,"I went with my wife for lunch we were curious since we use to go to Penguin, and was a little disappointed the food was bland and the service was just o.k."
1,"review for 1 bedroom suite (non-smoking)\n\nTHE +'s: oh, like maybe, EVERYTHING. impeccable service. amazing mod decor with dark wood and chrome accents. the 1-bedroom suite was amazing -- had 2 full baths and a fully equipped kitchen (not kitchenette!). private bedroom had huge comfortable bed, tv that rose out of the desk, and the master bath fit 5 women bustling around getting ready for the night out. main living area had an armoire so huge there were coat closets on each side. also, starbucks was downstairs. oh heaven.\n\nTHE -'s: the great thing was that the signature is isolated from the main casino. but that can be the bad part too since it takes a while to get from the signature to the conveniences of the main casino. still, the isolation means none of the stench of smoking and dirty money infiltrates your stay. the view wasn't much to write home about since it faces as yet un-developed lots.\n\nSUM: love, love, love the signature. recommend it to anyone who's willing to dish out the cash. it's totally worth it. share the cost with 10 of your closest friends -- there's enough room to sleep everyone."
1,"I just got home from Salon Salon and I'm really happy with the way it turned out!  Page took care of my cut and color, it was my 1st time getting my hair professionally colored, she did several different shades and it came out better then I expected.  Also better then expected was the price:)  I think I have finally found the salon I have been looking for, YAY!"
1,"I had a customer come in and her nails were banging so I told her I had to know where she had gone so that I could try to get my swag on her level.  To my delight she told me the place was just a few minutes away on Ray and Rural!  Now I'm not the type of girl who goes to the nail salon every week for mani-pedi's but a friend was doing a music video shoot and I was going to be in it so I figured I could expense it at that point...I'm sending him the bill.\n\nWalked in on Friday at around 1:00 and the lobby was pretty full so I debated leaving because I was on my lunch break and while I can get away with a lot I knew that it would probably be frowned upon if I took a 2 hour lunch.  Luckily everyone was helped within minutes of my arrival and they were able to get me right in.  The girl who was in charge of my nail transformation was Natalie and she was awesome.  Suuuuper sweet, call me a sucker for pet names but she kept calling me \""honey\"" and I wasn't mad at it.  She actually made conversation too which was nice 'cause I'm not all about that awkward silence you get with most nail experiences.  She did a great job too, my french tip toes are on point and my nails are able to be seen in public again.  I'm going to have to step my game up at work because coming here makes me WANT to be one of those girls who's in the salon every week."
1,"What a great and interesting meal!\n\nIn town for business and looking at CC's menu, I was intrigued when I saw Wild Boar  Meatballs.   Starting with drinks, they have an amazing mixologist behind the bar.  I went for a drink called Viva based on the waitress' recommendation.    This was a very refreshing, strawberry based drink with different herbs and fresh ingredients.  They also have an incredible wine list ranging from an inexpensive bottle up to $1500 + bottle of vintage.\n\nWe decided on the small plates menu as it was late and also there were a great deal of interesting items in this area.  The thing that impresses me so about this restaurant is the interesting combinations the Chef brings together.\n\nTo start. the Stetson Chopped Salad is an absolute must!  The waitress brings out this perfectly arranged aligned plate of chopped lettuce, chopped smoked salmon, trail mix, cous cous, and corn.  She mixed this all up with their amazing dressing and served the two portions.  It was an amazing explosion of different tastes and textures ranging from smoky salmon to sweet little raisins from the trail mix.  I could eat this every day!\n\nFor small plates; we went with the Burrata with Avocado and olive oil which was  a very tasty combination and a great start.  From there we went with the Wild Boar meatball which was although this was what brought me here, it was my least favorite dish.   Next we had the most amazing and interesting dish of the night, Pork Belly served on a toasted pumpkin bread.  This was absolutely amazing!  The salty and fatty pork belly was so perfectly matched with the sweet crunchy pumpkin bread.  I cant stress enough how amazing this was!  Our last plate was the Tiger Shrimp with corn and bacon.  The shrimp was perfectly grilled, the corn mixed with bacon was a great addition to the dish.\n\nWe were to full for dessert however all looked amazing including a dish that had ice cream made with duck fat. Cmon, really!\n\nA must next time I'm in Scottsdale again or maybe this is the reason to come to Scottsdale."
0,I was impressed I was contacted by the owner about my dining experience. I was honest and told him it must have just been a bad day for the meat. Somewhat surprised he did not as much as offer me and appetizer if I came back.... But that's the game of business!
0,"I LOVE how they give out a free samples every time we go in their store!\n\nThis place smells amazing! I don't recommend getting the peanut butter sundae though... Its like would you want some ice cream with your peanut butter? Even with 2 people we couldn't finish it cause its basically eating spoonfuls of peanut butter after another. \n\nWe also tried their brownie which taste more like fudge. And their massive cookie looks freaking delicious but expect it to be hard, not soft oogey gooey like how the cashier describes it."
1,"Came here late at night on Christmas day. Got an \""Aviation\"" drink with some fancy gin and a special red-sauce spaghetti pasta dish. \n\nThe pasta was super simple but the boyfriend claims \""HANDS DOWN the BEST red-sauce pasta dish I ever had.\"" Big claim considering he has had a lot of different red-sauce pasta dishes, including different ones I make at home! It was very delicious, fresh, and I want some right now!\n\nThe pasta dish was actually a variation of their late-night lobster spaghetti (they were out of lobster when we walked in or something). I could taste and see that there was parsley, evoo, a balanced and tasty red sauce, perfectly cooked pasta, perfectly cooked whole garlic cloves, some basil....and lots of magic, haha, super good. \n\nWe did not try anything else since it was late night. But based on service, drinks, and this pasta alone, would totally come back here for 'em again!"
0,"I've been to Koi in the past (when it had just opened) and was blown away. The edamame dumplings were definitely a showstopper. \n\nYesterday, however, encouraged me to write this review. The food was subpar at best. Edamame Dumplings were gritty and flavorless and the Baked Lobster Roll tasted like the mayo had soured. The only thing I took more than one bite of was my Hamachi dish. But then again, how do you mess up raw yellowtail covered in ponzu sauce?\n\nMy server was nice, but he should have comp'd the full plates I left on the table.\n\nVery, very disappointed. I guess I'm feeling generous... Or maybe the second star may actually be residual from my first visit. Either way, two stars it is."
0,"Circus Circus is closer to three stars than it is to two, but I can't give it a full 3 because there were a few things that needed to be improved in my most humble opinion. First, the good. The room we stayed in was pretty and clean and didn't smell like smoke at all. We stayed in the Casino Tower on the 8th floor in a non-smoking room, and even though we were in a non-smoking section (we always stay in non-smoking no matter where we stay in Vegas) we were glad that it didn't smell like smoke like other places \""Non-Smoking\"" towers.\n\nNow the bad: \n\nCasino Main Entrance valet- there was like only two dudes. Took  about 15 minutes to get the car because these two poor guys were taking turns parking cars and bringing cars back. One or two more guys would go a long way. The entrance where the hotel registration was didn't have this problem.\n\nIce Machine- It wasn't hot this past weekend. Ice machine on my floor was out of ice TWICE. No ice coming out and the thing said \""Making Ice\"". We had to go down a floor to get ice. Not cool.\n\nThe Room- Although the room was pretty, one major design flaw. The sink and mirror are on the INSIDE OF THE RESTROOM, NOT THE OUTSIDE, like other hotels, so if someone is dropping a deuce or taking a shower, you are assed out and have to wait to do things like paint your face, brush your teeth, shave or any other kinds of things you'd do while someone else is showering, which could be awkward if the person you are in the room with isn't your significant other. \n\nThe Bed- It folded like a taco when I lied down in it which means it was worn, even though the white linen was nice and crisp and the duvet was neatly pressed and damn near new.\n\nOverall, it wasn't a BAD experience, but it was not a GREAT experience. I'd probably give it at least one more shot."
0,"I absolutely don't get the draw of this place.  I really try to see things in as positive a light as possible, but I call it like I see it.  While some diners may call a dirty and neglected restaurant as one with ambiance and atmosphere, I call it for what it is, a place that has aged without care of replacing or updating things as needed, and that goes for the food too.  It may have been quite the fancy dinner at one time, but unless your taste buds are as stuck in time as this place, nothing exciting or even worth remembering here - very bland.  I guess as long as people keep coming and swooning over this old and gawdy place, that will continue to be used as an excuse not to care or change.  At a minimum, they really should at least sweep up the broken beer bottles and all the cigarette butts up in their parking lot and sidewalk."
0,"Average burger, old fries, and a sad excuse of a milkshake. \n\nAlthough the restaurant was super slow, the store was very dirty and the employees didn't even bother with it as they preferred to help themselves to free drinks as they conversed amongst themselves."
1,"Since it was my first time trying Hokkaido, I decided to try the Hokkaido Symphony Land and Sea combination plate. It came with filet mignon, scallops, lobster, and vegetables. It was amazing! It's a bit expensive, but you get an a lot of excellent mix of high-quality beef and seafood. \n\nChef Luong is very friendly and entertaining. He creates an awesome dining experience coupled with the delicious food he makes. The restaurant atmosphere is inviting and it shows that they thought about every piece of the design and its place.\n\nI highly recommend checking it out. You won't be disappointed!\n\nSayonara Benihana! Welcome Hokkaido!"
0,"So my boyfriend and I decided to visit this location after being thrilled with the recent facelift and menu upgrades to the Salty's in Scottsdale. Unfortunately and fortunately, our mediocre at best experience here has also reminded me to leave the Scottsdale location a stellar review (sorry Peoria!). \n\nWe went on a Sunday and this place was ghost town dead. At first impression, this place seems like a cool hangout for weekend get togethers, but upon further look, you can definitely tell this place is in serious need of a facelift. The columns are missing chunks of tile, the tables and barstools have seen better days and are falling apart, and one of the tvs we couldn't tell if it was just old or if there was some dried substance running down it. Overall the place just looks dark and dirty. On to the food....\n\nThe menu at this location is not the same updated menu from the Scottsdale location but still has similar dishes. We opted for \""tableside\"" guac (our favorite), and the fundido. The appetizers came out lightening fast, which you would think is a good thing, but it was almost too fast. The guac was brought out to us rather than made tableside  and had brown oxidation and oil separated from the dip like it had been sitting out all day. You could tell from the taste as well it was not fresh. The fundido was similar, like congealed velveeta that had been sitting out too long. We also had to separate some chips out from our basket because they were soggy with oil. For entree we shared a 6 taco basket with chicken tinga, grilled steak, the mahi taco, and the breaded fish taco. My boyfriend described the tinga as \""alright\"" and while the flavor of the steak was good, the pieces were minced so small that the texture was unappealing, almost like dog food. The chipotle crema saved the mahi taco but I think the taco was missing avocado slices, I couldnt remember from the menu if that was supposed to be included or not. The breaded fish taco was okay but was missing both avocado and sauce as described which was disappointing. Unfortunately, we're now both at home with upset stomachs, headaches, and nausea :(\n\nOn the brightside, our server was nice and checked in on us often. No complaints there. Unfortunately this wasn't enough to convince us to return though; next time we'll probably go back to the Scottsdale location. It's sad, this place has so much potential I feel like they are just not taking advantage of."
0,"I'm not really a buffet person, so just let me preface my review with that.\n\nI didn't really find much here I liked. The seafood seemed to be pretty popular but I'm not a seafood person. The mexican section was pretty sparse when I went up there but when my wife went she seemed to find more than i did. Just my luck :)\n\nI think I ate a few slices of microwave pizza and some breadsticks. The mashed potatos were pretty runny but they tasted all right. \n\nAmbience-wise, the place was pretty loud and filled with drunk people. Dinner was pretty pricey at $30/person"
0,"So surprised this place isn't that great. The restaurant is beautiful, the staff were friendly without being in your face, the waiter even comped our dessert because they were out of strawberries. Their outdoor patio is awesome and I can totally see this being a great place to hang. \n\nOnly problem? Food. Their in house ground burgers have a weird consistency and seemed like they were ground remnants. Their bangers and mash had tasty sausage, but bland potatoes. Worst of all, the creme brule was served ice cold and with a burned top. \n\nIt would take a food overhaul to bring me back. \n\nIn short, there's a reason it's empty in there."
1,"Avec une atmosph\u00e8re un peu british (et des serveurs qui parlent mal le fran\u00e7ais), vous aimerez bruncher souper \u00e0 ce restaurant.

0,"Bought my Toyota camry 2007 from this dealer, had some issues on my radio and went to them to complain the car was brand new and was bought from this dealer. The service manager wanted to charge me $400 dollars just for them to replace with a new radio. Will never go back to this dealer for any service on my car. The Car is working out great it is TOYOTA but the dealer i Would not deal with."
0,I just went into the establishment and was immediately denied service.  I had to greet the associates first and was then told they did not have time for me. They did not ask if I could come at a later time or if they'd be available later in the day. I have never gone to any nail salon & they not want my business for no apparent reason. No bueno!
1,Not bad for a 11 dollar per person meal.\nThe food isn't that spicy (even on medium)\nGreat food for its location
0,Was excited to try this place but the service was not great and neither was the food. Definitely not too impressed and won't likely return with all of the other great options in the surrounding area.
0,"NOTE: This review is only about the smoothies/juices\n\nSadly I really wanted to like this place, because I've been looking for a decent local juice bar...and I apparently still have yet to find a good one! I decided to order 2 juices. but couldn't find one that screamed ginger (I love ginger), so I asked the girl behind the counter what she would recommend and she mentioned that they can add ginger to any of the drinks. I decided to get the Pucker Up! and Berry Me Alive, both with ginger. I was hoping to get a small to try, but the size didn't seem worth it for $4.50 plus extra for ginger, so I got both in a medium size. \n\nThe Pucker Up did make my lips pucker but not in a good way. It was bland and sour and I could feel my stomach acids churning. The Berry Me Alive tasted like a cup of frozen berries. Yes, I know frozen fruits are practical in such places, but I've never had berries that tasted so lack-luster. Also, I don't know how much ginger I get for 50 cents, but it wasn't enough because I couldn't even taste it.\n\nFor 2 medium drinks plus ginger, the total can to about $13. So not worth it! Don't plan to ever waste my money here. I'll just drive to Thrive in Gilbert for now."
1,"Best service I've received in Pittsburgh! The food is pretty good, the drinks are decent and the bartenders are quick!"
1,Last baseball game of the season
0,"Stopped in to this joint for lunch one day and ordered brisket.  They had pulled it for sandwiches, instead of slicing it.  Was stringy and tough.  May try again later, may not. \n\nMy quest for good brisket in the valley continues.  So far Famous Dave's is my top choice."
0,"Poor customer service. \nBig plates, small portions.\nTexture of the beef didn't seem right - it was like chewing fake meat.\nPork tasted like duck.\n\nWorst experience was seeing a piece of foil in our beef platter. \n\nWe should've walked around MGM more."
0,"From start to finish, the experience at Odaki was pretty awful. We were (eventually) seated at a table in the near-empty restaurant where there were freshly made soy sauce stains and the chopsticks looked as though they'd been used and placed back in the pouch thing. Now, I live in Vancouver so my standards for sushi are naturally quite high. I also failed to mention that I'm not necessarily the most seasoned of sushi-lovers yet and I generally stick to more vegetarian choices. \n\nThough I can be adventurous with my food, I consider myself still relatively new to the whole sushi scene. When my spicy veggie roll arrived, it was covered in fish eggs. I was not down with that, and as a result immediately asked if it were possible to have the sushi remade without any of the fish eggs. That was nice, however the ingredients were not fresh and the prices were such a rip off. Luckily they didn't charge me for the extra one. However, the veggie tempura came to almost 9$ for maybe 5 pcs, which was astonishingly high-priced and low quality considering what I've tried in the past. My sister ordered pork dumplings which were served in a big puddle of not so tasty peanut sauce and they tasted strange and watery. Even my sister who is more experienced in sushi and Japanese food than I felt this place to have ripped us off tremendously. We were shocked that our bill came to almost 50$ all together and we had not ordered that much food. The miso soup was the last thing to arrive...very strange.\n\nThey were still playing Christmas music even though our visit was during the second week of January. Another big no-no. \n\nAnyways, all-in-all, I would never return. In fact I advise anyone wandering this part of town on an empty stomach with a jonesing for some sushi to avoid Odaki at all cost. If you decide to eat here, you will leave disappointed, feeling ill in your stomach from the not-so-fresh ingredients, and several (wasted) dollars poorer."
0,No customer service at all.\nService is really bad. I will never go there anymore waste my time n money.
0,"my SO and I went there on a whim as we were walking around the Verdun area! We love Indian food and were excited to discover this place.\nFirst and foremost: they had two groups of 8 having dinner that night. I know they were groups of 8 because it took 1 hour 45 minutes for our food to arrive due to a simply terrible service. so yes, I had the time to count. They could have brought us some bread... or SOMETHING, or told us about the delay, but we were ignored the whole time. I hoped that the appalling delay would be compensated by great flavor. I am reading the other reviews here and I'm confused: did you know butter chicken should not taste like sugar was dropped in it, or have you just skipped on the authentic Indian your whole life? I don't mean to sound pretentious (oh well...) but the flavor was not there, the food tasted like something I could have made in my slow cooker at home, but LESS flavorful. So disappointed! \n\nOn the flip side, the Samosa I had as an appetizer was good! So that earns you a star. And a pity star. Because I dislike feeling like I HAVE to write a bad review, but you guys need to step up your service and food game."
1,"Well.... what can I say the tacos here are  AMAZING. If theres something I would die for in life it would probably be tacos.. lol jk.  What Im saying is these were to die for. why havent I been here before ?? \n\nI tried a couple different kinds of tacos\ncarnitas\nbarbacoa\nand...My absolute favorite- COCHINITA ... delicious\n\nalso had the chips & salsa, salsa was really good. And lastly we had the Papas Fritas con mole y queso.\n\nI recommend China Poblano to anyone in Vegas. \n\nalso try a Margarita Sal de Gusano... topped with Salt air. its great"
1,"Yes, another gutted house-turned restaurant/ bar to no prevail succeeds. Yippie-Skippie.\n\nIt's walking distance from work, so thats 5 badass red stars right there. Then, I almost gave it 1 star thinking it was closed and realized that it is 112 out today and no one was on the patio. Who doesn't like sweat dripping on their Pastrami? And thats exactly what I had. Good shit. It ran me a little over 18 bucks for lunch with 2 Ambers. \n\nGo ahead and take someone \""out-of-town\"" aka Scottsdale, to show them the advantages of knowing places like this downtown.\n\nTo my dispair, with everything being \""authentic\"", they had a sensored-run paper towel machine in the restroom. Weak sauce."
1,"I don't know who this Nielsen character is but they deserve an award. A big, shiny, beautiful award. I don't know how I waited so long to try this place but my waistline is probably happy I did. I could eat this every day. \n\nFirst off let's talk about the d\u00e9cor. So cute! Very 1950's, tin signs and old photographs adorn the walls. The music makes you want to bust out your poodle skirt.  The menu is short and sweet. The frozen gloriousness comes as a sundae, in a cup, in a cone, in varying sizes of carry out containers and as a concrete. They only offer 3 flavors a day (aside from what's already in to-go containers). Chocolate, vanilla and their flavor of the day. Follow them on Twitter to find out what it is every day (@NielsensFCLV). Warning: Following them will only increase your yearning. \n\nThe concrete is really what captured my heart. Choose your flavor and mix it with any one of their many toppings. They even have some suggestions in case you're not the creative type. The Raspberry Cheesecake is obscenely good, with fresh raspberry sauce and real cheesecake chunks inside vanilla custard. I also have had my share of chocolate mixed with Reese's Peanut Butter Cup, a natural and beautiful partnership. \n\nThis place is top notch when it comes to desserts. The staff is really helpful and patient as you peruse their many possible options. Definitely make this a stop when you're in the area!"
1,"This is Luciano's second location with the first one being in Duluth.  The food was very fresh and tasty, the service was very good, and the decor is nice.  It is a little pricey and even with a $25 discount our bill was a little steep for what we got.  I had the special spinach stuffed tortellini with shrimp in vodka sauce.  It was good but not worth the $24 price tag.  The gelato and cappuccino were authentic, especially the latter.   It was real Italian style and not the steamed kind like you get in American coffee shops.  Others have raved about the chopped salad but it was just iceberg lettuce in oil, something I can do for about 50 cents at home and easily."
1,"Getting obsessed with Sichuan food recently; this place is authentic and SPICY. Small and uncrowded, as close as In-N-Out and cheaper than Smashburger for lunch. Infinitely better and comparably priced to Panda in the SU. \n\nI've been here twice now and had the following:\n\nSichuan chopped chicken - comes on a bed of dried chilis, great and peppery. Chicken was a bit bony, though. This is ostensibly their signature and it definitely tastes great and leaves your tongue pleasantly numb.\n\nSichuan twice-cooked pork - Fantastic lunch special dish, spicy in all the right ways.\n\nEggplant in spicy garlic sauce - not nearly as hot as the above two dishes, but amazingly savory and visually stunning. Almost my favorite dish, but it's hard to pick when everything is so good."
1,"Mmmm...chipotle black bean burger...GET IN MY BELLY.\n\nPita Jungle is one of those places that you just feel cool eating at. It has a hipster, artsy vibe to it and everyone is over the top nice. \n\nAs stated so slyly above, my fav is the chipotle black bean burger. I get mine with no bun, because I am not about to let bread fill me up when there's a tasty little dish like this one on the table (they have cranberries inside of the burger!!!). It comes with a side of chipotle hummus and garlic new potatoes, which are so flavorful and good.\n\nSecond fav is the falafel pita. What's a falafel you ask? Well, it;s heaven in a round crispy garbanzo bean package. If you have never had one, just try it. You will like it."
0,"This was THE worst mani/pedi experience of my life. I arrived on time for my appointment and was not greeted until after ten minutes of sitting in the reception area. And then was told by the owner I couldn't have the 5 minute massage I requested because there wasn't enough time. Really?! Someone could have been massaging my feet in the time it took you to greet me? And also, I was unaware when I made my appointment I had to request extra time for a five minute foot rub?!? Not normal. The staff was totally unprofessional. My manicurist and the manicurist she was stationed next to used foul language and spoke negatively about the owner which made me feel incredibly uncomfortable. They didn't even soak my hands to soften my cuticle. Went straight into pushing them back and cutting them making them bleed. They didn't even clean under my nails. The pedicure didnt draw any blood but was as equally awful, not relaxing, and uncomfortable. The worst part about it all is I paid over $60 for this torture. Basically I paid that ridiculous amount to have my nails painted. Something I could have just don't myself. Never. Again."
1,"I love this place. It's probably the best thing that has happened to an airport. Just imagine a great place for food, not expensive, and inside an airport... Usually, you have these chains and generic restaurants in there but not at Sky Harbor. There's an LGO.\n\nThere's already an LGO \""intersection\"" in Phoenix with the pizzeria, bakery, burger place and grocery. The food is great there. I compared the prices at the airport with the regular prices and they were the same! You would figured that you would get charged an arm and a leg because it's inside an airport. But no... great food, same price.\n\nI love the English muffins, the Kale salad and pizza. The sea salt chocolate chip cookie is good too. So if you are in Terminal 4 flying Southwest, you can head toward Gates C-D and grab some good food. It's worth the walk... or a ride on the moving walkway. You'll get there in like 2 minutes!\n\nThe food is really good, the price is fair, the staff is great, and you have a HUGE variety of items to choose from on the menu. Sandwiches, pastries, pizza, salad, soup, etc. Go try it out next time, and then go to the regular LGO location too. You'll love that you did. :)"
0,"Tried Atlanta Bread Company for the first (and last) time this week.  Food was very mediocre.  Fillings of sandwiches were fine, but the bread tasted stale.  To be named \""Atlanta BREAD Company\"" and not have bread that knocks your socks off is ridiculous.  Not to mention the unfriendly manager and a front door that wouldn't open properly.  Overall, not a good experience."
0,"The other reviews can give you the details. I'll make it easy with this statement: \n\nIf you think this airport shuttle service will be easier/cheaper/faster than waiting for a cab I strongly suggest you reconsider. The ridiculous amount of hoops you must jump through and incredible length of waiting time makes this \""service\"" one of the worst deals in Vegas."
1,This place actually has a legit Beef Noodle Soup. It was better than many local Chinese restaurants in more ethnic neighborhoods of California.
1,"Johnny is the real deal!\nHe saved me last week when my tenant's AC went out.  He was very upfront and honest about my situation and suggested that I get a new ac rather than use his help to repair.  He doesn't sell AC units so he was sacrificing making more money from me for the betterment of the situation.  REALLY?!  What a great guy!   He even followed up with me a couple times to be sure I was getting a good price on the new unit I found.\n\nI have 10 properties in the valley that constantly need updating and help. I will be keeping Johnny's number on my speed dial in case another AC issue comes up again.  I HIGHLY recommend him if you're looking for honest help.  \n\nOh, and I should mention he came out to rescue my tenants AC on a Sunday!  This guy takes no days off.  Incredible!"
1,Great little neighborhood bar.  Went to watch football on Sunday and had a good time.  Beers were ice cold and not expensive.
1,"I haven't found Thai food that blew me away in Pittsburgh, but the waiter here was incredibly friendly, and my mock duck dish was solidly tasty."
1,"Stopped here for dessert, led by yelp, and were not disappointed. We split a baileys tort and strawberry shortcake, and both were fabulous. Fair prices, $3-5 per dessert."
0,"This place has so much potential, so it's kind of sad that they don't have better service.... \n\nMy fiance and I waited at the bar for a drink for about 15 minutes before anyone asked us what we wanted. That may not sound too long, but the place wasn't even busy. And what's funny is the bartender was like purposely ignoring us. There's no way she didn't see us politely flagging her down. She had a soft drink that she was drinking, and she stopped right in front of us, took a nice looooong drink... kind of relaxing, then she looked past us out the window, and proceeded to ignore us a bit longer. And its not like we were just standing there, you can try and flag them down, but they just ignore you like alien possessed humans staring into space or something. \n\nThe bartender finally asked what we wanted, but by then we were being seated so we said nevermind. Then we proceeded to have terrible service at our table, to the point that it was just kind of amusing. Oh and my cobb salad had these huge mushroom tentacle things that made me gag and we just sorta wiggled them at our friends like \""look at this huge sick thing that's in my salad!\"" And the sliders are way over priced. The cheese curds were good, but a little heavy. \n\nI say the place has potential because it's a really nice location and the inside has a nice ambiance. There is also an extensive beer list, but none of that really matters if your service is that bad..."
0,"This is definitely one of the Fairfield properties that is underwhelming and needs a refresh.  Rooms are very small, there are cracks in my bathtub, and it does not even have the Market.  However, it meets minimum Fairfield standards - comfortable bed, clean room, and friendly staff.  \n\nIf you are a business traveler who is Marriott gold elite like me, you may prefer to stay at one of the Courtyards nearby. However, this Fairfield has one thing going for it... There is a Starbucks right across the parking lot that is open early and late!"
0,"Great beer selection. About 8 taps, all of which are solid. \n\nNice low-key atmosphere.\n\nFood is reasonably priced. Sandwiches and entrees between $6-12. Brutus salad is interesting, but overdressed. Mahi-mahi was flavorless but fishy. Fried tomato sandwich without much inspiration, but they weren't cheap on the bacon."
0,"PF Chang's is usually a great place to go with quality friends and enjoy as delicious meal. The location, as stated by Penny Lane, has the worst service. We ate in the bar, and while waiting 30 minutes for our entrees, we witnessed a BF by the bar tender and four tables come and go around us. Our food was cold and the sauces were congealed. \\"
1,Great place! wonton's while you wait. Best hot and sour soup I've ever had! Everything is really good. Nice clean place.
0,They need to train the staff better on how to respond to clients.  They are not busy and the clerk could not take the time to tell me the different oatmeals they serve she just pointed at the board. That is just lazy.  I was the Only person inline.
1,"Excellent experience. I got a great manicure and pedicure there last week. The staff is really friendly, the treatment is much more involved than most (massages were excellent and lasted at least 5 minutes more than at other places) and the whole thing was $30. The quality was great, my nails still look amazing."
1,"Go -- you'll feel young and hip...even if you're old and a square like me. \n\nHits: house sodas,  every burger, sweet potato fries, bottomless mimosa brunch, great staff, and great food -- all thanks to a spot on management team. \n\nMisses: TVs -- but that is just a personal irritation. Most people probably love them. If nothing else, it allows for sporting updates.  \n\nHints: Try their match dot somm events - a night of junk food and wine. what could be better? also they do take out until late -- i think midnight, but that needs to be verified."
0,"This place is run by rude teenagers. The orders take FOREVER, the smoothies aren't very good and if they get your order wrong, they argue with you about what you ordered. Avoid this place!"
0,"What the hell Tom Colicchio?!?!?!  My blindfolded cats can make a better sandwich!  I'd give it -5 stars but I can't. \n\nHubs and I were at the pool and wanted some food.  Since we've been long time fans of Tom on Top Chef we thought we'd give it a try.  We weren't surprised by the prices (it is on the strip, after all) and expected the sandwiches to be top notch.  We ordered the slow roasted pork and flank steak.  I should've known this was going to be a problem when I didn't see the cheddar in the steak sandwich.  It said \""aged cheddar\"" on the menu, why wasn't it on my sammie??   Ehhhh, I wasn't going to walk all the way back to the eatery from the pool.  I thought to myself, \""I can deal, I'm sure the rest will be yummy\"".  Boy was I wrong.  If you like some bread with a sliver of meat and a pound of salt, this is the place for you!   I'm pretty sure the high school kid at subway can assemble a nicer sandwich than this.  Not only were they thrown together, there was barely any stuff on the bread...  not to mention my forgotten cheese.   And it was sooo salty!  \n\nSorely disappointed, Tom.  How come all the other food you make on TV looks so good?  You've really cashed in on your fame.  I'd write him a note expressing my concern but I know it won't reach him and he's too busy raking in $$$ to care. \n\nLooking for a good sandwich on the strip?  Try Earl of Sandwich at Planet Hollywood."
0,"The service at Sushisamba was so bad that I am actually having trouble remembering the quality of the food. All I know for sure is that most of it was delicious, despite the fact that the fusion of Brazilian, Peruvian and Japanese cuisines seemed a lot more forced than I'm sure the owners envisioned.\n\nAnyway, the service. Our waiter was inexplicably absent for twenty to thirty minutes at a time, which is not the way a waiter at a place that thrives on small plates ought to do his job. Glasses sat empty. Plates sat bare. He didn't check on us, even when we were waiting anxiously to pay him and leave.\n\nLas Vegas weeds out places like Sushisamba over time. There are always young, dynamic restaurateurs that want to come in, hire an enthusiastic staff, and serve creative food. This place had the food down. But with service like the kind we had, I can't imagine a long tenure."
1,"I highly recommend this to place to other tapas lovers. We had a 50 dollar dinning credit for Aria and picked the best reviewed restaurant here. We spent well over that and it was worth it! \n\nWe began our meal with a their version of sangria made with Spumante, (usually red or white wine is used) but it I was excited as it had my favorite kind of champagne. Sweet, fruity and not overly dry. It was light and refreshing but contained very little fruit perhaps due to being served in a small champagne flutes. The tuna tar tare cones were amazing! The light and airy crunchy cones they came in provided for a wonder contrast with the tuna which melted in our mouths. The dates wrapped in bacon and stuffed with goat cheese, were phenomenal as were and the breaded manchego cheese pops. Whitefish ceviche was yum but we wished there were more taro chips to go with it. Yellowtail was just eh. \n\nWe finished up the meal with simple but delicious donut holes with butterscotch sauce and a very nice port wine. It was a perfect combination and end to a superb meal. Our server Donovan provided excellent service and was very attentive yet unobtrusive. He provided wonderful descriptions of items offered and he was very helpful with recommendations when we had questions on what was best to order."
1,"We went here based on the Yelp reviews -- we are in Vegas so much that trying a new spot was necessary.  While totally aimed at the tourist, I have to say that the vibe was amazing  and loud.  By amazing I mean everyone was having fun and enjoying their meals.\n\nEverything was big and over exaggerated, which is exactly what you look for in Vegas.  It didn't matter that the food wasn't exactly perfect, it was that they tried and the presentation was fun.\n\nThe milkshakes are to DIE for and was really filling and oh so devilishly yummy. \n\nUnfortunately the burger was not so much.  I mean...it IS a burger place.  It was more bun than bang :-(\n\nSo 4 stars for fun, but outside of Vegas this place would flop on quality of burger."
0,"Did I order the wrong thing? I was looking forward to my 2am plate of poutine after my night out! I was devastated when my fries came out all soggy and cold. Granted, gravy would eventually make my fritas soggy eventually but still, the ones not even touching the sauce were limp. Place was packed with NYE after party goers, how could the fries be soggy?\n\nThe only reason it's not one star is because of the vintage feel of the diner and the crowd this place draws. Even though my fries weren't great, people watching was fantastic!"
1,"First impression... Neat, clean, nice and welcoming! Let's face it, I'm a chick so I'm quit hesitant to get anything done on my truck. But I literally was welcomed with a wave, a smile and a warm greeting. I pulled in about 5 minutes ago for an oil change and it already looks like their halfway done! I will definitely be back and I'm going to tell my husband about this place as well! He's going to be so jealous! ;  ) good job Brake Masters!"
1,This place is usually pretty good. Nice beer selection. Food is pretty good . Not too fancy but definitely good
0,"Have eaten MANY times @ Flemings.  Only sat in the bar at the South Scottsdale location, but sat in the dining room last weekend.  From the time we sat down and cold air was blowing on us, it was a disaster.  Still have GC for them so will use it up at DC Ranch location which has much better dining room service."
1,Not the best club in Vegas but it is definitely a great place party if there is a specific event going on there. It's not that big of a club but if you're looking for a great place to go clubbing then this is a good spot.
0,"Came for lunch. From what I saw, all of the seating is outdoors - so don't come here if you want to be inside or away from the heat. They do have misters. We were the only ones in the entire place, 1 waitress. Believe the other reviews when they say the food comes out SLOW and not at the same time. Half of our party was done before the other half got its food. Quality of the food was just OK, nothing to rave about, burgers come plain, just cheese, no other toppings.\n\nOnly reason I gave the place 2 stars instead of 1 is it LOOKs like a cool spot, maybe it's better at night - but I won't be going back during the day."
0,"I spent 2 nights 3 days in this hotel in my visit.  Here's my breakdown:\n- wifi internet is indeed free of charge, but ut is at 1 mb/s.  Meaning you have to spend about a minute to open facebook.  I ended up using my data plan instead.\n- room and bathroom walls look like it is an 18th century place, no it is not historic, it is old and cracked.\n- bathroom is tiny.\n- they will barely give you shampoo.  I am a man with almost no hair and one bottle barely get me through a good shower.  I wonder what would be the case for women with longer hair.\n- breakfast is limited like all other hotels I have been to, but I was honored to have egg shells in my scarmbeled egg on two consecutive days.   Am I lucky or is it a standard in the scrambled eggs! !!\n- price wise, you can go to the fanciest hotel and casino on the strip for the same money.\nSimply put.  I am extremely disappointed with Mariott that this will be the last time I ever use them."
1,An old but renovated hotel.  Stay in the octavious towers for sure.  This place is huge so expect to walk to get anywhere although its in the center of the strip. Try a drink at numb located in the casino or try your luck at the tables. Pure is also a nice spot to see or be seen.
1,The service was top notch. You must try the pork nachos.  Dressings are all made in house and are very good.

0,"Watch your credit card statements. I noticed in Dec 2013 they had been charging me a small monthly fee for a \""protection plan\"" I had never signed up for. Since I pay my bill in full every month I didnt  notice it until the end of the year. Turns out I had paid them 52.55 in charges for the year. I have been trying to get my money back for 2 month now! I call the customer service number and someone always passes the buck on soemone else for it taking so long...... Beisdes that, Kohl's has always been pretty good ,Deal wise."

1,Was walking bye yesterday and went in on a whim because I saw the specials board- and it was definitely worth it! The owner let me get 2 small salads; the caprisse salad and the greek salad. It was awesome! Very light and summery but great ingredients and great taste. Even if you aren't in the area it is a great place to go eat and have great atmosphere!!!\n\nAlso make sure to grab a glass of ice tea- it is so worth it. I want to go back just for that!
0,"It  Only Took About 15~20 MIns To be Seated for 4 people  even though the Place was Packed like Sardeines . Well We were seated and were ignoerd for about 5~10 Mins than the waitress came took the Drink Orders Then never came back for like 5~10 min than the assisant manager was walking by FAST we said Politely \"" Excuse us we R Ready to Order . and Totaly IGNORE like she Pressed A Facebook Button .

0,"After waiting so long for the reopening, Thai Spice was a big disappointment. The food was bland, unoriginal, and pretty much what I don't look for in Thai food.  Going with a group of friends mostly versed in Thai food, we proclaimed that Thai Spice won't be a reoccurring lunch spot.  We ordered the Pad See Ew ($9.95, and had some goofy name on the menu), the Green Curry Beef ($10.95), the Larb Pork ($9.96), the Chicken Fried Rice ($9.95), and the One Sun Beef jerky ($8.95).  Everything was ordered with \""medium spice\"" and \""Thai style\"".\n\nThe Pad See Ew was served without Chinese broccoli as an option. The sauce was some sort of a generic Chinese style teriyaki sauce.  The chicken was bland.  There was no spice, and even with gobs of their chili powder (which we had to ask for), there still wasn't much flavor or heat.  Pad See Ew is an easy dish, and somehow Thai Spice still makes it bland.  Unfortunately, this was the best dish of the meal.\n\nThe Green Curry with Beef was also a miss.  Lightly sweet and without much flavor at all, or spice, it was boring to eat.  Just plain boring.  The occasional bell pepper was the only thing that gave this dish any interesting flavor. I have had worst tasting curries, but this one was probably one of the blandest curries I have ever had.  What's the point of eating this again?\n\nThe Larb with Pork was border line gross.  It was the most offensive dish that we had, and one of my friends just plain couldn't stand it.  The flavor was off.  It had a lot of vinegar, along with a poorly balanced blend of herbs that were just totally unappealing.  Again, no heat at all to even cover up the bad flavor.  Do yourself a favor and don't order the larb here.\n\nThe chicken fried rice was unoffensive.  It was also bland as heck.  The chicken was dry, and there was no flavor to speak of.  Is this food for 5 year olds?\n\nYeah, the jerky wasn't good either.  The sauce was uninspiring and overly salty.  The meat tasted of poor quality.  I had to convince my one friend who had never had Thai jerky before that it is actually really good at some other places.\n\nThai Spice is some of the most bland \""Thai\"" food I have ever had, and Americanized to boot.  There were a lot of Chinese dishes on the menu.  You might want to just stick to the Chinese stuff.  If you're looking for Thai flavors, go somewhere else."
0,"Used to be a great gym, but management changed and it all went downhill. I used to go about 3 times a week and loved it, I was on team, had a membership knew the staff. After the ownership changed I noticed the staff change too, people were now very rude. Then I noticed the paths never changed, I mean like it took 3+ months before a new one was introduced. Next the bouldering padding, it was very minimal. It had holes, duct taped on some parts unsafe all around. I jumped down (like I always have) onto a part of the padding that was duct taped, in the shape of a pyramid kind of so the top was sticking out, and rolled my ankle. The staff told me it was sprained and that i should try walking on it. The next day I went to the doctor and it was broken. I was out for 3 months and haven't been to climbmax since. I'm sure if the management had never changed, it would still be 5 stars like it used to."
1,"I am a big fan of sushi and have been to many different sushi bars in the tempe area. I was so impressed by sushi time! First big plus - an immaculately clean and rarely crowded establishment. I am always surprised that there are never many people there when I go - maybe I just go at the wrong time, or people don't know about it, because the place rocks.  You order up at the front counter, and then they bring your tray to you when the food is ready - drinks are self serve also. \nTheir sushi is really delicious and fresh! They make one of the best Las Vegas Rolls i've ever had - make sure to try it if you go. Also, every day they have 'combos' posted, where it's $10.99 for two types of rolls (the rolls in each combo are different every day) and miso soup. For the price, delicious sushi, and clean, modern atmosphere, I would definitely recommend this place!"
0,"for starters the place is the same as before ,it's still to bright, food fare,beer selection fare,bad decor\n\nsame place different sign\n\nwe felt the food was the same as eating at Eat-n-Park\nfish was over cooked, & just a plain ,bland chicken salad but the tomatoes were fresh\n\n\nIn this  case a change in the name didn't change restaurant"
1,An Arizona elite institution.  High academic and artistic standards. Quite challenging for students. Teachers are unusually highly communicative.
1,"Love this place.  Reminds me a lot of ny pizza.  This is easily one of my favorite pizzerias in town.  The other place I usually go to is Metro Pizza on horizon ridge.  They offer the usual salads, cal-zones, pizzas.  I usually order one of their specialty pies.  The pizzas itself are a little pricy, but nothing too ridiculous."
1,"Awesome drinks and top quality service from Marcus the server and Ivan the bartender, outstanding!  Food is fresh and delivered on time, drinks are on par. Will be back to visit."
0,"I guess I just don't get this place. Why would you pay top dollar for a good but not great hot dog? Heck, if you want a hot dog like they serve at this place, their food truck is a somewhat more reasonably priced option. And if you can get to Tempe, you can get a better hot dog for half the price at Ted's. I guess this is a hipster place, and if you are not a hipster, it is not for you."
1,"\""Children and pet friendly while outlet shop\""\n\nDecent outlet. Selection not as good as Cabazon, but not bad either. Surprisingly very Dog friendly with plastic baggies and dog fountain. Very children friendly with water fountain and train rides."
1,"Just got home from the Bistro.  We got the calamari, (not so much) and the pot stickers (they were pretty good) for our appetizers.  We had the Thai Hot Pot for our entree.  This EASILY feeds two people, for only $10.50.  It was very good, and we will be going back, and having it again."
1,Nice buffet with plenty of choices to include a chef to prepare your raw noodles.  They also include a fresh sushi bar.  The place is usually packed for dinner.  I paid about $45.00 for two adults and one child.  Their seafood selection is pretty good.
1,"Want to get a party poppin' With over 30 flavors to select from, one can find a flavor for any occasion.  I've been in there a little bit too much, getting snacks for the office as well as snacks for clients/meetings.  A mini is a great size to try out different flavors.  \n\nFrom savory selections like Beer Cheddar, Sour Cream and Chives, fruity flavors, Strawberry or Pineapple to sweet blends, Kettle corn and Butterfinger!  Love the Puppy Chow mixture of popcorn, chex mix and pretzel sticks in sweetness!  \n\nCan't decide? Try the Scottsdale blend...White Cheddar and Carmel, YUMMY!  \n\nHidden inside the strip mall, totally worth checking out!"
1,Great place to grab a few unique pieces that'll step up your style game. While you're there you can take a gander at the avant guard art on display too.
0,"Nothing Joyful about it. Worst I've had in years. The restaurant is in a failing strip mall. No windows, dark and dingy and it smelled of Pine sol.  Staff did not greet us with a smile ( I can't blame them, maybe too depressed). We went at lunchtime and the place was empty - save for one table.  I ordered the Kung Pao as a safe bet. The chicken was hard and rubbery, the sauce was salty - tasted mostly like soy sauce. I thought maybe it was just me, so I took the rest home for my husband. He said it was \""inedible\"". Then I told him where I went and he said \""I could have told you that, that place is awful\"". \nMy friend ordered the Shrimp in Lobster sauce, she said it was ok, but she would never go back. The egg rolls were soggy and greasy and the fried rice was non nondescript. I have no idea why anyone would give this place 5 stars! I know it's been around a while - maybe they are regulars."
1,"One of the coolest places in Vegas! I definitely loved furniture shopping here. They have EVERYTHING. The shops are located in the 1st and 2nd floor of building A and 1st floor of building C. There are styles for everybody: from modern, wild and flashy celebrity, vintage, east coast old money, to california beach house styles. In addition to that, they have specialty stores that focus on sofas, solid wood furniture, pillows, paintings, rugs, chandeliers, and much much more. Some vendors allow you to buy and bargain directly with them while others require you to go through a designer. If you need a designer, their office is located next to mundo.  Prices here are much lower than retail stores. Also, it seems like delivery charge to out of state could be reasonable. Check out this place and be inspired by all the design! Also if you need a snack, head over to Mundo for great happy hour deals!"
0,Had Red Lobster tonight for dinner. Not such a good idea! I got the Rock Lobster tail that came to me partially raw (the entire bottom of the tail). I sent it back. When I received the new one it was so overcooked and rubbery that I could have bounced it off of the floor and then it would have landed back on my plate. Staff was very nice about it and was kind enough to remove it from our check. Probably a good thing since I wasn't going to pay for it anyway.
1,"Loved this place! variety good, prices great. Very helpful staff when I asked about ingredients because of my food allergies. Loved the food - perfect bread. My son (8 yo boy) said it was the best sandwich he's ever had - he ordered the pizza sandwich. And loved the giant pickles which were only $1. We'll be back again"
0,The service and ambience were excellent however the food was awful.  We ordered a $27 Fettuccine alla Bolognese described as homemade fettuccine with meat sauce.  The meal was disgusting.  My husband and I only ate a few bites before deciding to leave.  The fettuccine was not homemade and the meat sauce was awful.  I would rather pay $27 for a frozen TV dinner than eat there again.
0,"First, I come from a smaller market, so I may have a unique experience; however, I feel strongly enough to warn the fellow consumers about only part of the bad experiences I had staring shortly after day one:\n\n- Misrepresentation during initial sale call\n\n- Failure to disclose actions taken on the account\n\n- Refusal to communicate in writing\n\n- Multiple emails sent to me for the wrong person or with the wrong name\n\n- High pressure tactics in creating an unnecessary sense of urgency \nfollowed by silence for weeks or months from the company\n\n- Failure for employees to address specific issues\n\n- Refusal to escalate concerns upon demand\n\n- Employees failing to return calls or emails\n\n- Employees with poor communication skills/reading from scripts\n\n- One particular \""Dating Director\"" was downright rude.\n\n- High turnover with \""Dating Directors\"" leading to errors, false promises, and \ninconsistency\n\n- Email \""form letter\"" responses which did not address the issue\n\n- Matching seemed to be based on who is available rather than anything to \ndo with my interests or profile.\n\n- Matches which were clearly not within my profile\n.  \n- The illusion that feedback to the Dating Director was being consider; however, later told that feedback would not change my profile\n\n- The lack of authority for employees to address grievances or concerns\n\n- False statements that my \""profile\"" could not be changed\n\n- When a supervisor did agree to address the grievance, they quickly \nbecome reachable.\n\n- Supervisors stated that phone call conversations would be followed up by \nan email documenting the conversation.  This did not happen.\n\nI will say the concept is great. But it didn't work for me, at all.  That part aside, the business practice feels more like a timeshare sales, and that treatment had lead to this review.    \n\nI strongly urge you not to use this service."
1,The service is off in a funny/cute way here...i asked the girl to recommend some non-meat noodle offerings and she recommended the beef noodle soup...hahaha... I gave in and said ok just easy on the meat.\n\nGreat deal for $8.
1,I had so much fun at Tavern 51!  The drinks prices were very reasonable.  The bartender was fun and attentive.  They have a great patio out back.  The decor is nice and the place could not be cleaner!
0,"let me start by saying i won free tickets on twitter. @cirque did a RT contest and gave away free tickets to this show. \n\nmaybe its because im not a die hard elvis fan, or maybe it was just the show itself, but definitely wasnt a fan, and super glad i didnt have to pay for these tickets.\n\nwhen i was a kid, my neighbor and babysitter loved loved loved elvis, so i was familiar with is music and his story. all the cirque shows always amazed me, but this one - not so much.\n\nsome of the dance scenes were awesome. i like that they incorporated a lot of different styles of dance and the regular things they do at a cirque show. maybe the narrator was annoying?\n\ni do like that they kept it positive, and didnt end it all weird or depressing.\n\nlike a lot of people say about this show, if you LOVE elvis, go see this show. if you love the cirque shows, dont see this one."
0,"My husband made a reservation for my birthday, he requested the fountain view but of course was not guaranteed. We arrived 40 min early & the hostesses were so overwhelmed, didn't even say happy birthday to me & told us to wait an hour & a half for the view.\n\nWe took the regular table, the restaurant was so packed, we were literally next to other tables & it was super loud we couldn't have a conversation so we left. \n\nThe restaurant doesn't not provide a memorable experience, they should focus in quality & not quantity!"
0,"I was there with the same group as Chrystalle B (below).  The food was great, but that was it.  Service was slow and the bill was a complete joke.  There weren't prices on all the items on the menu, so 12 people trying to look at a calculator tape and try to figure out what roll was what price? Not a good time.  We won't be back!"
0,"\""buy, sell, trade...\""\n\n i always thought that buffalo exchange was where everyone gets there really trendy vintage clothes, which is what it is. but having to pay as much as you would if you were to go to a hole in the wall clothing store, isn't what you're asking for when going to a thrift/ \""hand-me-down\"" store. \n\ni went in intention to sell, i brought two bags. 1 garbage bag full jackets, dresses, and jeans, etc. and 1 garbage bag of fairly worn shoes. i waited an hour for them to check the 2 bags, only for them to take about 9 items. from what i remember.. they took an obey wallet, levi jeans, lace dress, 2 floral print dresses, members only jacket, olive green jacket, & a grey sequence top. it would have to be in good condition for potential buyers, because i remember hearing the employees fighting over a button missing or shoes being way worn out when in actuality they were only worn once.  \n\nthis review is mainly targeting to what i feel the styles of what they are looking for to buy... i truly feel that the clothes they are looking for are not garage-sale item clothing (of course), but more of the lines of vintage hip-hop/ sportswear & urban outfitters style. looking thru the racks of clothes, i noticed a lot of florals, prints, vintage sports wear, etc. \n\nof the 9 items that they took from me, they decide what they can sell that particular item for and if you chose to get cash back, you would receive 35% of what they can sell that item for. and if you agree to do a trade, you receive 50% of what they can sell that item for. the gentleman that was selling 1 pair of guess jeans received about $9 for 1 pair of GUESS jeans. they bought a vintage lacoste sweater (that i outgrew) from me that i only paid $3 for at savers, and when they were pricing the sweater, they were going to sell it for $25? i definitely have to agree with other reviews that they OVERprice items when people are obviously are getting rid of them."
0,"This place looks nicer from the outside than it is. It's full of mainly low-end retail stores in the main building, as well as chain restaurants flanking it. For the frugal, this might be a treasure trove, as there are many outlets for cheap buys. It's hardly a destination and it's frequently a zoo. The strangest aspect of it is that it's just a stone's throw away from the 180 Biltmore Center. If you need clothes, you're on a tight budget and don't mind stores that are virtually torn apart from rabid shoppers, this is a destination. For tourists or people who want to enjoy a day out on Camelback Road, this is bypass shopping center."
0,"I rarely write negative reviews, usually only positive ones, but this was one of those experiences. \n\nWow. This was by far our worst dining experience in Vegas.  It was the worst spent $700 ever. We made a reservation for 7 people about 1 month ago since we were going to be in town for a trade show. Our last appointment ran late, so four of us showed up the restaurant late. 3 were already there, but couldn't be seated until the missing 4 arrived. They could have been ordering drinks and appetizers, but instead, the table sat empty.  \n\nWe arrived and were told that we could eat, but that we would have to be out of our table by 9. Okay, that is fair, but how they treated us after that was not.  \n\nWe had plenty of time to eat, in fact we finished 20 minutes before 9. But we kept getting pushed...the waiter first said that he would choose out appetizers (because us reading the menu for 2 mins was too much) He kept reminding us that we were in a hurry. We rushed through our food and at 8:40 the waiter gave us dessert menus, threw some fiddle faddle packages, courtesy of the chef, on the table, and said that we could choose dessert and that we MIGHT have time to eat it.  Seriously guy? \n\nGratuity was included. We didn't give a penny more.  On the way out we commented to the hostess that they could have handled that situation way differently.  Understating that we had to be done by 9, they could have sped things up in the kitchen instead of constantly reminding us that we needed to rush. She argued with us instead of apologizing.  That is not customer service. \n\nEven more disappointing, we LOVE Michael Mina restaurants.  And planned ALL Michael Mina restaurants for our trip. This Michael Mina restaurant let us down :( But--American Fish (Aria) and Michael Mina (Bellagio) are both excellent!!!"
0,"This is a great place to take kids & enjoy your time. The snoh and teas are great, but the customer service is horrible. They've messed up my orders three different times and each of the times they question me like if I'm lying. I returned the tea once cuz it was made wrong and the girls behind the counter kept starring. The manager tried to tell me that I was wrong. I don't think I'll go again after these incidents. Other than the people, the snoh and teas are great (if you get the right one). If you go in the middle of the day, the employees are much nicer."
1,"This is a really great taco stand style place.  While the fact that you order at the counter, and the look of the menu they have displayed may remind you of Filibertos' or any other [fill in the blank]bertos' restaurant, the comparison ends there.  \n\nThe place itself is decorated very nicely, with a modern touch, as well as a Mexican influence.  There's a salsa bar with a variety of salsas and spicy vegetables that is properly maintained so it doesn't look like everything has been sitting out for a week like you see in some other places.\n\nI've been there twice so far, and have only tried two things.  Carne asado tacos and a carne asada burrito.  I think you can judge if a Mexican food restaurant is good by the quality of their carne asada.  In this case their carne asada is really top notch.  They use quality steak, and it seems like they grill it on an open flame instead of just a flat grill (Just based on taste, didn't actually see them do it).\n\nI highly recommend this place if you're looking for a great giant burrito for only around $4.50."
1,"We ended up here after dinner. We wanted a bar with lots of personality. This bar is so swank and cheesey. The decor is not halfway tiki; it is fully committed to the wonderful gaud of tiki. The wals are covered with tiki prints and bamboo. There are glass bouys converted into lamps and puffer fish converted into lamps hanging from the ceiling, providing a soft low light. \n\nThere's sitting space at the bar, where you can play video poker. There's a small elevated area for three parties of four-ish. There's also a table area in the middle of the floor, but the tables and chairs are like for tiny people. The seats are like tree stumps with upright back rests. Only really narrow-assed people can sit on those things. \n\nThe specialty tiki drinks are all $8 unless you want the souvenir mug, then its $20. \n\nThe bathrooms are disappointingly normal. There bathroom stalls are wall papered with old south Pacific island inspired music albums and posters. But otherwise austere. \n\nThe crowd that goes to Frankie's are all arty in some way. There were a couple girls dressed like they were out of Grease and some beatnik-looking guys. And we even saw a prominent artist hanging out at the bar. \n\n* off the strip, non-casino"
1,"First and foremost: Like most take out Chinese food restaurants, this is a western style Chinese food restaurant. If you come on here to gripe on how \""unauthentic\"" it is, you need your head checked.\n\nI've been eating here for years. It's family owned and run and the food is not only cooked super quick, it's cooked well and priced just right!!!\n\nMy personal fave is their cashew chicken, which I order extra spicey. The sauce is wonderful, there's a prefect balance of chicken and veggies, and they don't skimp on the cashews!\n\nTheir hot'n sour soup is also a welcome surprise as it comes with big chunks of imitation crab and shrimp.\n\nAre you eating alone and hate left overs building up in your fridge? They do half orders on most of their menu items for $6 with a side of rice. I'm 5'9\"" and 165lbs, and one half order fills me up just fine.\n\nThe only problem I have is that one of the dudes working the cash register can be a little impatient, but I find the rest of the staff super friendly."
1,Came highly recommended and lived up to the hype. The oxtail cheese fries were crazy and delicious and the burgers (Miyagi and a custom) were killer. The craft beer list was very strong and the staff was knowledgeable.
0,"This was my first trip to Charlotte. I've looked up other hotels in the area and have decided upon the Omni. The Omni is very overrated. When we checked-in, they had a five day wedding celebration in progress. No bell captains available upon check-in. When we got up to the room, I was very surprised to see how outdated it was for the money. Ripped curtains, blown out light bulbs in bathroom. And most of the extra electrical outlets did not work. I had my cell phone charging, come to find out the outlet never worked. I switched it to another outlet, and, again, no charge. Upon my morning cup of coffee in the room, the mini creamers were sour. I called room service, and they never brought them up. Nor did they refresh the coffee station when they cleaned the room. No fresh creamers and two sugars for two days! I take my coffee serious. Lol. The second day in the morning starting at 7:00 AM, I was woken by a pounding sound of music coming from the courtyard. This was the ritual going on for the wedding. It continued for two hours. If the wedding was going to be honored on the lower floors, they should have put the other guests on the upper floor to avoid all the commotion. The garbage cans on site were overflowing with garbage for two days. No one took the responsibility of emptying them. We paid good money for a nice, clean, quite break. Only to have nothing but a out of date room, tons of noise, and a unclean looking surrounding. Guests should have been forewarned of the wedding festivities when booking. Although, the staff was very accommodating, they weren't on a mini vacation, we were. The only thing we were offered was free coffee or a breakfast beverage in the morning ! Also, be aware, if you don't join their rewards club, check your bill for a $9.95 a day charge for Internet. We were really disappointed in this hotel and will not be returning at all. See attached pictures."
0,"Not much needs to be said about a bar devoted to being besotted.\n\nThe various signs with catch phrases and college colloquialisms attest to this.  \""I like your pants. Especially on my floor,\"" says it all.  \n\nPerhaps a devoted patron of this bar would respond with \"" Don't take life too seriously, you're not going to make it out alive,\"" another turn of phrase that can be found mounted with Rocky Point pride in this establishment.\n\nThe atmosphere is meant to be very casual, laid back - like you were spending your spring break in Puerto Penasco.  But the similarities end there.  Quite possibly home of the worst house margarita - so full of the synthetic and syrupy sweet and sour mix that there is nothing more discernible.  Despite there being a full bar, the bartenders have little knowledge of cocktail recipes - I would recommend ordering beer by the bottle.\n\nAlthough a full menu is available, there is no better word to describe the food than...bad.  If you have ever had a bonafide street taco in Mexico, then you will be dismally disappointed by their poor imitation.  One would assume that it is quite difficult to mess up a taco, but here they got everything wrong in both the preparation of the meat and the salsa that shamefully tried to mask the poor taste of the meat.  \n\nThere is no need to dissect the menu or its gustatory offerings any further, as Dos is quite frankly a place to play beer pong and get wasted.\n\nIt does offer a variety of entertainments such as Tuesday comedy nights and Wednesday's Texas hold 'em.  Bean bag tournaments are also held here.\n\nDos certainly caters to a specific crowd, I am not one of those that feel as though they still want to be on spring break."
0,"I eat out frequently and was eager to try 131 Main as I'd heard so much about it.  My dining partner and I stopped by several weeks ago and  I'm still thinking about how the experience was.\n\nThe food was simply bad.  I ordered a hamburger - hard to mess up a hamburger.  It was way over-salted, although the french fries were great.  My lunch companion did not fare as well.  Her salad, which had been ordered with dressing on the side, came to her literally SOAKED in dressing.  I'm sure they would have fixed this, although too many hidden camera shows have frightened both of us into never sending food back.  On to her salmon...  it was not plated poorly (looked like a previous customer's leftovers) and had little to no flavor.  \n\nI initially thought the service was great - loved the team service, but then oddly, while we were in the middle of dinner, our primary server brought the check.  No offer of \""Would you like anything else?\"" as is customary and happening at the tables of another server. \n\nThe experience was so negative I can't possibly recommend this restaurant.  Frankly, I'm surprised by all the positive reviews and friends who had suggested this establishment. Maybe there was a time when it was great, but that time has clearly passed.\n\nThis place is over-priced for the low-caliber of food, the interior decor is like an inexpensive diner, and there are too many superior restaurants to choose from that offer better food value and eating experience."
1,"Never been to anyplace like this before and we are completely hooked! Now we wish that Las Vegas is only 10 minutes away. The place was cozy, very clean and our server was very gracious and attentive. The food A++++!!! We ordered 1/2 dozen oysters, a lb of blue crabs, shrimps, and  crawfish, a basket of soft shell crab with cajun fries, and three beers - for only $59. Unbelievable!!! (Yes, we were starving, we just came from the boneyard tour). You can never ever find anything affordable like this in the Bay Area! And the seasoning, hot n juicy in medium.. arrrghhh. so good!! i can't help dipping my fries and shrimps on this special sauce. Now hubby and I can't stop kicking ourselves for not going twice, but it's all good, we're going back to Vegas this Labor Day and Hot N Juicy is on top of our list!"
1,I love this place.. I have been here twice. And I have been to lots of mexican places in Madison. But to me it is the best of them. Would highly recommend
0,"This place is terrible, from the food to the service.  Add some atrociously (even by Vegas' standards) high prices & you have a losing situation.  I officially deem this the biggest rip off of a restaurant I have ever eaten at in my life.\n\nI had the most bland roast chicken I have ever tasted .  Came with pasty mashed potatoes & 'steamed veggies', which was half cooked broccoli.  Also sampled were the hot turkey sandwich (ok, but for $22 for a SANDWICH it should have been waaaayy better), liver sandwich (blech) & the daily special - shrimp dinner (frozen fried shrimp from a box).\n\nEven the free pickles they give you were pretty gross.  Everyone had one bite, then just left them.  Service was pretty lame & indifferent, which can work in an actual New York deli, but definitely does not in Vegas.  Don't waste a minute of your time or a penny of your money at this place."
1,"This bar is the shit, probably my favorite in Phoenix. Great drinks, great people and great art! I could go off on how great it is but I'm not going to... JUST GO THERE! Tonight.. NO.. RIGHT NOW haha\n\nP.S order the Leffe, its a great beer"
1,"I love their pork salad. Great healthy food, fresh guacamole. Kinda like the subway of mexican food. Sometimes they forget to give you the vinergerette dressing which really makes the salad so make sure you ask if they don't."
1,"Umm, I know this place has been closed for years, but they had some of the best food I've ever eaten.  If anyone knows a good substitute, please let me know!\n\nLol, gotta love how these other low reviews only complain about the service.  I'm sorry, I go out to eat to EAT, not to be waited on hand and foot.\n\nThat being said, I had no complaints on the service or the food.  Every time I went there, I was personally greeted by Chef Moises, who had a definite passion for his food. We were often given free samples of new dishes and salsas, and though short-lived as this place was, there always seemed to be something new on the menu.  Their salsas and sides were extremely unique, and every thing I tried was bursting with flavors I'd never experienced before or since.\n\nI've been trying to find something similar to it, but keep coming up short.  As far as I'm concerned, this place is sorely missed.  If you know where I can find Puerco Pibil and Mole this good anywhere else, please share!!"
1,"How have I not been here before?  After 10 years down the road, I finally checked it out.  What a treat.  Great food!  Try the double chicago dog and get some fresh cut fries!"
1,"Another great time at the August showing of \""Raising Arizona.\"" How much fun is this place? Thanks Lindsey."
0,"I would not recommend them.  The dr. I spoke with seemed knowledgable, but they are EXTREMELY expensive.  I mean really, really, really expensive.  Not only that, but they said they would only charge me initially for the exam of my animal, and then and only then give me an estimate of further charges, but rather than do that, they stuck an IV needle in his arm, without telling me they were going to and without getting my approval for this additional charge first.  And then they billed me for it.  Personally, I consider that unethical padding of a bill.  I won't return to them."
0,"THIS REVIEW IS ONLY ON THEIR FROZEN HOT CHOCOLATE\nNOT ON ANY OF THE FOOD\n\nTheir frozen hot chocolate is what they are know for, but it was just mediocre.  The consistency of the drink is icy, like a blended drink, not creamy like a shake.  The flavor/ quality of chocolate tasted like maybe a ghirardellis blended drink.  Nothing too special, especially for $12.  Not only that, but the whipped cream tasted like it was from a can of reddi whip, opposed to fresh.  This drink was ok, but for 12 bucks, i expect more.  I think an appropriate price for this beverage would be more like half the price."
0,"I was here for nearly 2 hours just so my cat could be vaccinated, which took 2 min! They did not appear to be busy or short staffed while I was there. I probably would have been waiting longer if I did not leave the room to remind them I was waiting. I only came here because I adopted a cat and was instructed to bring him here for his neuter and vaccinations. I was not impressed after my first visit and will not be returning after this second visit. No other redeeming qualities so I would not recommend this place to anyone."
0,"I was going to tell a long story, but the basic fact is that the check-out clerk's parting remark to me was \""You're disgusting.\""  We had disagreed, but not argued.  Even if I had been disgusting, no retail clerk should every utter those words to a customer!  I will never set foot in Ulta again (at least not after I return the product I cannot now stand to use)."
1,"Eine positive \u00dcberraschung am Rande der Durlacher Kleingartenanlagen:\ndas Restaurant schien zuerst zu voll, um unsere (unangemeldete) 8er-Gruppe unterzubringen aber das sehr nette Personal machte es dann doch m\u00f6glich.\nGetr\u00e4nke, Pizza, Salat fiel alles in die Kategorie gut & g\u00fcnstig (Pizza knapp 6 EUR, leckerer Boden) und konnte von der Portionsgr\u00f6\u00dfe her auch hungrige Sportler \u00fcberzeugen.\nEine Mitesserin am Tisch fand die Lasagne etwas wenig gew\u00fcrzt, ansonsten h\u00f6rte ich keine Klagen.\nDie Pizzakarte k\u00f6nnte (f\u00fcr meinen Geschmack) noch etwas umfangreicher sein, ich denke aber mal, dass sich pers\u00f6nliche Zusammenstellungsw\u00fcnsche problemlos erf\u00fcllen lassen.\nDie Tagesempfehlungen auf der Tafel (z.B. Rinderfilet, Muscheln) sahen durchaus interessant aus, hab ich allerdings zu sp\u00e4t wahrgenommen.\nZusammenfassend denke ich mal, einen Besuch der Fattoria da Federico wird man zumindest wenn man eh in der N\u00e4he ist keinesfalls bereuen."
0,"This place is dirty. Sticky tables all around, not the best quality food either.\nGo 3 miles down to Panna Thai for some real nice food."
1,"Man I wish we had this in Texas!\n\nOnce I booked my trip to Vegas I made it my mission to go here at least once. We stopped by on a Saturday morning and yes, there was a wait list, but it moved quickly.  \n\nI had to try the Sage Fried Chicken Benedict from Man V. Food and it didnt disappoint. When it's first laid in front of you you begin to question what the hell you signed up for. Then you dig in and realize that it's all good (almost). It's a lot easier if you attack it a layer or 2 at a time. If you cant finish all of it, at least knock out the fried chicken, mashed potatoes, and the cream sauce. Those were the best parts. The fried pasta and the tomato dont really add anything special. Next time I come I want to try something with a bit of sweet to it instead of something entirely savory. The price is on point and pretty fair considering the amount of food that you get. The drinks can make your bill jump, though. Stick to maybe 1 juice and some water.\n\nOverall the service was very speedy and friendly. Another thing I loved about the place was the music! During my time there I heard The Black Eyed Peas, Prince, Aaliyah, Sade, and Zhane! Now that's what I'm talking about!\n\nIf you're looking for a massive breakfast with a twist, I say go for it. Just prepare yourself for the food coma afterwards."
1,"We came to Montreal for a conference, ate at Chez Bong the first day and then went back the next because it was so much better than anything else we tried while we were there, in Chinatown and in the convention center district. Delicious Bibimbap. Cozy, with nice wood paneling on the walls. Very friendly."

0,"I'm not really a fan. We went there on a weekend once and it was crazy and crowded. We ordered some food and didn't find it to be that good. The service was non-existent and we had to track down a server ourselves a few times. It might be a good place to party, but its not a good place to eat."
1,Best place to eat in Charlotte!!! I go there at least twice a week!!!! A+++
1,"Starting from the lahmajun and finishing with the fruit tarts. Manan Bakery has everything.  The sweetest bakery i have been too. I used to work next door and would always run in for a treat after work. My favorite is the birdmilk cake. Even now i always find myself  going back to Manan Bakery with friends and family for my sweet tooth. They designed my friends daughters one month birthday with a beautiful traditional vanilla strawberry cake that just melted in your mouth. Thanks Manan Bakery, i'll be seeing you guys real soon."
1,"Came here the other night with a $30 for $60 Groupon.  I have to admit, my expectations were lowered after reading several of the reviews, but I was pleasantly surprised.\n\nFirst the d\u00e9cor.  It was nice, a little too dark for me, but overall I liked the feel of the place.  We sat in a high-back booth in the bar area that felt very private.  Even the bathrooms were well kept and modern-looking.\n\nThe service was also very good.  Our server, Shay, took great care of us.  She was attentive, knowledgeable about the menu and kept our water and tea filled all night without us asking once.  Our food came out quickly and the billing process was also fast.\n\nThe food was good but not great.  They have a decent kids menu for $6.95 and my boys got the bbq ribs and mac and cheese.  First the ribs, tender, well seasoned, and a generous portion (5 or 6 bones).  The only problem was the sauce was a little spicy, especially for kids, so my son ended up eating my wife's food instead.  The mac and cheese was average.\n\nMy wife and I shared a wedge salad to start and it was the typical wedge, iceberg, blue cheese, bacon and tomatoes but it was good and fairly priced at $5.50\n\nMy wife went with the maui ribeye (marinated in soy and pineapple juice).  It was well seasoned and served with a loaded baked potato.  She ordered it medium but it came out closer to mid well-well done.  The meat was still flavorful and tender so we didn't send it back.  The baked potato was perfectly cooked and had enough flavor that no S&P was needed.\n\nI got several of the appetizers for my entr\u00e9e (potato fritters, beef carpacchio, and mesquite grilled shrimp).  The potato fritters were good, basically fried balls of loaded baked potatoes served with a semi spicy remoulade.  The beef was okay, needed a little more dressing on the arugula and seasoning on the beef.  The shrimp was the most disappointing, 4 grilled shrimp with little flavor and some sort of onion slaw that didn't go well with the shrimp.  I found myself dipping the shrimp in the potato remoulade and it was much better.\n\nThe place was a little pricey but the groupon made it a more than fair deal.  I would go back to try some other items but probably order any meat a temperature less than I normally would."

0,Horrible service..and (3) $40.00 steaks that were a bit dry and tough i...we personally had a bad experience an will never in this life time return..so don't believe the hype..Believe me folks the place look nice but ain't all that..!
0,The barbecue was cold and certainly nothing to write home about.  I was hoping for some amazing Carolina-style BBQ.  This was not the place.  I should've ventured farther from the hotel in search of the real thing.
1,Staff is amazing and made my first visit a great one. Pizza is great. Not the best I've ever had but it was delicious. Plenty to chose from on the menu. Good happy hour specials. Will have to stop by again and spend more time here.
0,"I went to this vet for almost 2 years and can't remember any of their names...isn't that strange?  I started going here because another co-worker took her dog here.  One of the first visits was because my cat was peeing on things.  The vet said, \""well, it's a male cat, they are pains in the ass.\""  I should've known right then and there this was the wrong place.  Well, my cats don't get sick very often so I just kept bringing them there for annual check-ups and shots. \n\nWhen my cat Floyd started getting sick, we started visiting more and more.  The 2 different vets recommended all sorts of tests, which all came back normal.  The last time I went, the lady vet who I had never seen before recommended another test, which we did.  At this point, it had been 2 months and I was at my wits end.  I ended up taking Floyd to another vet along with his test results.  The new vet immediately saw abnormalities in the results and it turned out that he had stomach cancer.\n\nThe worst part is that the vet at my old place didn't even call to discuss the last lab results with me.  I had to call and get the results sent to the new vet.  then a week after I put Floyd down, Spencer Springs called to ask i I wanted to discuss the lab results.  I coudn't believe it.\n\nHands down worst customer service.  They are not personable and it seemed that they couldn't care less about my pets."
1,"Outstanding!  This is great fun.  Anthony Cools is thoroughly personable and a consummate entertainer.  He treats his subjects with respect and care . . . yes, even though he runs them through truly embarassing hurdles.  (You'll have to see for yourself what I mean.)  As the audience, and therefore the 'cast', changes constantly, the show is always fresh and new.  I look forward to seeing this again!"
1,"Had a great breakfast!!! Located inside the Golden Gate hotel which is recently renovated with a fun 1930's vibe.\n\nStarted with a fantastic cinnamon roll!! (which I think they sold out of right after us, all bakery items made fresh every morning, but when they r gone they're gone)\n\nHad fun reading their place mats which had fun facts about the hotel and Fremont while waiting for our food. \""1933 prohibition ends, Fremont stunned to discover whiskey had been illegal\"" \n\nFor my breakfast I went with eggs Benedict which was on point!  Perfect hollandaise sauce!\n\nOverall menu is very basic but very good. Wait staff helpful and fun. Cant wait to be back for pie looked awesome."
1,"I have been coming to this store for a few years now, but lately it seems I am only buying shoes for the twins.  They have great shoes for boys and girls.  I ended up buying 2 pairs for my little boy and 3 for my little girl, after all a girl needs more shoes."
1,"Not as good as Persian Room, yet they have really good meat and great service.\n\nHookah is well packed, hookah guys are nice and change out charcoal and maintain regularly. Lots of options.\n\nThey also have live music sometimes. Drinks are pretty good too."
0,So not impressed. It's gone downhill from when they opened.  Today it broke half way through and the dude wouldn't let me go back through.  ALSO.  THERE IS ALWAYS A SMALL DIRT STREAK LEFT ON THE BOTTOM OF THE CAR.  something isn't right with that.
0,"We were there for drinks and hanging out. There is a $5 cover charge for men. Got there noticed 3 different bar stations, 1 dance floor, 1 bull ride area, and outside patio. The music was a weird mix (hip hop, pop, rock n roll, with a mix of country). It is OK. The crowd was a mix of 20 to 30s, and drop in a few 40s+. Drinks were expensive!"

1,"This bar is still open, now known as The End and has moved to 4821 Spring Mountain Rd STE G, Las Vegas, Nevada 89102.  I was recommended to check out the place by a friend who saw them on \""Bar Rescue\"".  \n\nThe beer tasted good and was reasonably priced (especially for Vegas).  The shots in the syringes were tasty.  \n\nThe pizza (with dough flown in from Boston) really hit the spot.  The mozzarella tasted fresh and there were lots of toppings.  \n\nWhile the place seems to attract a goth crowd, we're not goth (at least on the outside) but felt welcome.  We had a great conversation with one of the owners, Jazz, about Bar Rescue and horror movies, on which he's quite an expert.  \n\nOverall, it was a great experience and welcome break from the Strip.   If I lived in Vegas I'd probably be a regular."
0,"Usually been given good customer service but was trying to return a few items with receipt and employees had made a mistake with the receipt but clerk told me \""our employee couldn't have made this mistake.\""  I still had the tags and when I brought them in the next day was apparent the employees had mislabeled the clothing items.  The cashier was rude and implied I was lying.  The store manager was also rude and never even apologized!"
0,"Not very nice...I have been twice because I am in need of a good manicurist. This makes the 4th salon in my area and still no luck!!!! Anyway, the owner is \""barky\"" if that makes sense...she is very stern and abrupt and in the middle of my 2nd drying session she yelled at me \""You pay now!\"". I kinda looked at her like lady..calm down and get out of my face with the yelling. My first visit was similar she abruptly kicked me out of the massage chair after my pedicure and barked, \""you sit in there!\"". Instead of sitting I just walked out the front door. The other staff are decent but the owner should get a mussel and not be allowed to interact with customers. Will not be returning..."
0,"It's so promising. Great specials. Awesome space. TV's everywhere. Full bar. Good food. Great place to grab some beers before and after a spring training game.\n\nBut service sucks. I don't understand why I have to be carded at the door, carded at the table, then carded at the bar. There were 3 groups in the entire place, and we still got slow and crappy service. \n\nI wish I had better things to say. But really.... the experience completely sours the good things about this place."

Lots of goodies within the ice cream.\n\nOur biggest problem was the customer service. The last time we went it took SO LONG for them to ask what we wanted. There was only one person in front of us in line. \n\nThe place was also dirty as can be. There was stuff all over the floor and we couldn't find one clean table to sit at. It was disgusting. We almost decided to go sit in the car in the parking lot and enjoy it! \n\nNot the best Cold Stone I've ever been to. It's a shame - we love their ice cream."
1,I needed some coffee today... so I rolled through the drive through and ordered my usual triple shot cappuccino with honey.   They do a great job here and I will definitely be back.  The coffee here rivals my usual spot copper star coffee.  The drive through is awesome... I love not having to get out of my car:).
0,"Went here for lunch today at this location for the first time and my husband takes a bite into broken pieces of GLASS in his food!! He ordered the Gruben sandwich and it was in the slaw part. He spit out a chunk of broken glass, dug around on his plate and found more little broken pieces! We told the manager, she apologized then said \""Oh I'm sure you're fine.\"" Im glad she was so sure of that! Not much empathy from her. Then said they mix the slaw with their hands so this shouldn't have happened. Uhhh ok?!?! She offered to refund us on the sandwich and not the rest of our food. Us and the other couple we were with did not want to continue eating our obviously so we asked for a refund for all of our food, you would think she would've done that in the first place without us asking. Luckily my husband did not have any cuts or swallow any of it. Not going back! Very very odd response from this manager!"
1,"This place is hilarious! Truck Driver breakfast= Budweiser in a can, served in a brown bag with a side of bacon. Ha! Holy snickers pancakes! This thing can feed 5 people. The food is so funny but so good. You can pretty much share everything but who would want to do that? Oh and the Bloody Marys are totally insane. Only go here if you are starving!"
1,I love this place!!! Ever since I saw this on man vs food I had to try it. The first thing I got of course was the Andy's Sage Fried Chicken I tell you what one of the best things I've eaten in awhile. I've been there 3 times so far and have never had a problem with service or wait staff. I've also indulged my craving with the Apple Cinnamon pancakes yum yum! I recommend you try it at least once. Not everyone has the same experience as the next person but from my experience so far not a bad one.
0,"So very nearly a 3 star - this place is 2.5 (why can't yelp do half-stars like flixster?)... the place is a conceptual hodge-podge priced for the super-rich. I felt uncomfortable there - but a lot of that has to do with my occasional social anxieties. Still, Canal oozed pretentious asshole (present company excluded). I can't even call it douche because douche can't afford this place on their waiter wages. \n\nEven if I had this kind of money, I wouldn't go here ever... it's just not for me. I liked some of the concepts and the runway and curtains looked kinda neat... but then the exposed pipes on the ceiling looked like a cross between cool and gross as some of them appeared to be sewage lines - why would I want to have a meal with sewage lines running along the wall right next to my plate? \n\nThe menu was also this odd hand-made confusion... everything about this place was one-off. Even the appetizers had attitude - a simple bacon and cheese finger sandwich clearly aspired to be more. It was delicious, but c'mon. I didn't drink anything - I simply had a diet coke. The server was very nice, but brought my coke out with a huge lemon slice on the rim which left seeds in my drink. Odd. It's relatively new though, I'm sure the kinks will get ironed out over time. \n\nI'd like to see a fancy-pants place like this serve a turd pate - like plate up the shit they scoop out of shrimps and garnish with mint leaves - and charge 80 bucks for it... I bet people would eat it and pay for it. Bah. \n\nSarah and I wandered around the mixed shops and arrived at the end before realizing it was more than one store. They all sold the same crap - most of it was grossly overpriced. Again - this goes beyond douche - the clothes were more stylish and simple and much more expensive than douche can afford. To be honest, much of it was quite nice -but still, if I had a billion dollars, I'd feel like a fraud paying 800 bucks for a casual jacket or 300 bucks for a t-shirt. Wasteful. \n\nI am surprised that this sort of thing has permeated this far south - I thought it was a North Scottsdale thing. I'm discouraged because I don't like the crowd this sort of place will attract, but at the same time I like what it'll do to my property value. The reputation Scottsdale has really bums me out because I live here and I love it here. There are so many places to go where you don't have to encounter the douche-ness. It's just becoming increasingly more difficult to convince anti-Scottsdale people to come. Eventually everyone here will be bobble-headed plastic robots with too much money and no taste... I'll be consumed or assimilated or destroyed.\n\nI do have a feeling that the bottom will fall out and this mansion of cards will crumble to the ground - Scottsdale is living beyond its means. Or perhaps 'if you build it, they will come' is the thinking. This is a strange time indeed. \n\nIt was my first Yelp event and I realize Sarah and I were antisocial - I attribute much of it to the setting... which was unsettling."
1,"I had a blast at XS!!!\n\nWe were fortunate in that we didnt have to wait to get in ... \n\nOnce we got it, we scoped out the place and went straight to the bar.  The drinks are pricey???  My friend paid around $45 for 3 shots of kamikaze.  I really like how in the inside of the club opened up into the outside patio area.. made the club feel a lot more open and less claustrophobic. \n\nMy girlfriends and I had a blast... the crowd wasnt wack (unlike PURE.. which as my bf puts it.. is the \""JV team\"") and the music was bumping... good times at XS!!!"
1,"Come Thursday 5 a 7 time, Philemon bar gets packed quickly, until it's elbow-only room around the bar. I was there with a big group, and someone had the foresight to reserve us some plum seats, so we were cozy on the couches in the front window. It's a fancy crowd, and perfect for people watching. We were particularly taken with the lookalike of Mad Men's Christina Hendricks. They were playing some good tunes, too, that kept the vibe upbeat and a little dancey (confession: there may have been a little chair-dancing going on after a glass of bubbly). \n\nI was very pleasantly surprised with their wine list, especially the selection of wines by the glass. There were not one but three different sparkling wines available by the glass. I also had a mighty, peachy good glass of Burgundy Chardonnay. They also had a few beers on tap, and make most mixed drinks, so there's something for everyone. I haven't sampled the food, but they do have some small dishes available if you need something to soak up the alcohol."
0,"Took my wife for dinner on a Saturday night and ended up walking out after the first bite. The sushi was stale and room temp at best, with the selection limited to tuna and unagi. The food was terrible. I tried the s&s chicken and my wife tried some chicken with mushroom. Immediately after the first bites we looked at eachother and knew we were leaving. I feel bad only leaving a few bucks for the waitress but this place is revolting. How it got 4 stars is beyond me. I've had better chinese made by a french foreign national than this place."
0,"This place wasn't for me - not because it wasn't nice (we got upgraded to a beautiful room), but simply because of the location. I'm in my twenties and was looking to party and be where the action is - and I was really upset because we were so far away from anything fun. I actually wanted to switch hotels but it was too late. We spent a fourtune taxi-ing to center strip, because waiting an hour for a shuttle to take us there never really worked out (especially if you go at nighttime, the shuttles don't run late.) We could have used our taxi money to stay center strip at somewhere equally as nice - and we probably would have got more exercise walking everywhere rather than cabbing (I also love walking.) Also, I didn't like any of the restaurants available - there was low-quality cheap fast food or high-quality super fancy expensive restaurants - nothing in the middle. I wanted great food, plenty of exercise, and to be in the heart of the action - so the palms wasn't for me. \n\nHowever - If you're looking for somewhere nice that you can totally relax or gamble off strip at affordable prices, then this is it. I just wasn't in it to relax (or gamble.)"
1,I came here yesterday after my mom and I have been scoping it out to try. Everyone I know (literally everyone) is obsessed with Dutch bros and now that it's walking distance from my new place I figured why not check it out. \n\nWe pulled up to the drive thru and this young blonde cheerful guy (didn't get his name) greeted us and asked what we wanted. We told him it was our first time but the Dutch freeze looked amazing. He explained everything and was so helpful. He even bought our drink for us. \n\nI've been in the industry for a long time and you can tell when someone is doing something because they have to vs doing something because they just really care about their customers and that's this place!\n\nAnywhoooo give it a shot you will love it! Try the bob Marley :)
0,"Came in for a Chocolate Malt and got Hershey' s Syrup with vanilla ice cream, very disappointing."
1,The food was OK and the service was meh. The ambience seemed to be confused more than anything.  There's a bookshelf in the restaurant that didn't belong. The servers all need a course in what it takes to do the job.
1,"Love the pizza here.  But the only draw back, I have encountered, is when sitting on the patio, the service is slow, and the waiter tends to forget about checking on drink refills."
0,"Bleech. Welcome to the chain that Sysco loves. If you love uninspired, bland, boring food that helps give chain restaurants their hated reputation you've found the right place. If you like waits due to slow or no service this is your place. If you really want to see someone try and create a faux New Orleans environment and come up woefully short at the feeble attempt, this is your place. About the closest this would come to New Orleans would be Slidell, LA style. Slidell is a small city just North of Lake Pontchartrain and I'll just leave that slam hanging...\n\nI would much rather eat late 1970's high school cafeteria food than be forced to choke down what is served here. And if you want a \""New Orleans\"" experience with your food you're better off finding your closest Popeye's Chicken for something that's Louisiana fast vs. the stuff they bring to your table, which in the case of this Henderson location is usually: A: Cold  B: Not what you ordered C: Overpriced for what you get. Pick 2 of those choices on almost every visit. \n\nHow this chain has proliferated is a testament to Sysco's ability to keep bulk food prices down, and for people to tolerate crappy food and even crappier service. \n\nIn short, you would be better off scouring Yelp for the absolute worst Las Vegas casino buffet and going there vs. eating here. At least there's Walgreens and CVS's close by for the Pepto and Tagamet you'll need after the fact. And as I'm writing this I realized it's not far from the Mongolian grill that made me sick too. Is there something about the East side of Stephanie, just South of Sunset that is destined to have crappy food? I'm beginning to wonder."
0,"You will be horribly disappointed if you have to pay to get into this hellhole.  Terrible bar service, overpriced drinks, unattractive drunk girls being pulled on stage.  There were 3 Coyote girls trying to run the show, but weren't doing a very good job of it...it was as if they were just going through the motions, and they looked bored.    After 5 minutes watching a bunch of drunk girls making spectacles of themselves, I was bored to tears and wanted to leave.  Please do yourselves a favor and go somewhere else, there are so many other better options out there!!"
1,"Very knowledge and helpful staff!!   I don't know a lot about tires.   Oscar answered all my questions, and made me feel secure about the tires we choose also gave me a great deal!!    For sure the place to go!Sm"
1,"I went for lunch with a large group and the place was pleasantly empty. The decor is very modern and has a comfortable lounge style.\n\nThe chips and salsa are a great starter. You get three tasty kinds of salsa: brown, red, and pico de gallo. The tortilla chips are fried perfectly. They are extremely light and crispy.\n\nI tried the steak tostadas. The meat had a food flavor and the tortillas were nice and crunchy. The red jalape\u00f1o and fresh cilantro on top brought excitement to each bite. \n\nThe dishes are small, but they are are also inexpensive at $6-10 each. Along with the chips and salsa, I got plenty of food, so portion sizes are only an issue for big eaters. It seems like a great place to share several dishes between everyone. \n\nI would definately go back for the food, but I wonder if this place becomes a standing-room only drunk fest when it gets busier and later in the evening (if so, no thanks)."
0,Cheap drinks but the bar and scene is very ghetto for being in Gilbert. They have a stage with old big screen tvs on it when it can be used for entertainment. All the other tvs are over 10 years old. Did I also mention the homeless man hanging out the the smokers area....terrible food bad service but hey you definetly get what you pay for.
0,"I was setup for disappointment on account of the false advertisements. I actually read reviews before I went here. They are way off. The ads said there were thousands of petroglyphs here, even suggesting to come at 10AM when the sun shines on the glyphs and to bring your own binoculars. On top of that, the website said that there is a butterfly exhibit in Feb. that was part of the \""tour\"". Sounds awesome, right? And I'm a pretty good photographer too. \n\nSo I get here. The visitor's center is nice and informative. However, the price is a little steep for what you get. I walk through the back gate and enter the trail. It's a flat, pebbled trail, only a 1/4 mile long. There is no \""tour guide\"", nor a \""tour\"". There was no butterfly exhibit. I'm there at exactly 10AM and there are not thousands of petroglyphs. Even with the binocs, they are hard to find and faded. For just $6 parking, you can see way more glyphs at South Mountain Park on the Kiwanis Trail.\n\nThe most exciting part about this tour was that a large squirrel approached us (see attached photos) and was really, really curious about us. You reach the end of the trail and that's when you figure out that you've been duped. If it wasn't government run, it would have been shut down a long time ago."
1,"Drove by and found this place, so i decided to stop in. I learned that this Rocco's is not affiliated with the other Rocco's in town. When I first walked in, being from the NJ/NYC area, I smiled. The place felt like home. The pizza was good. The free cannoli (courtesy of Yelp!) was good. Only thing I didn't like so much was that Calzones have to be special ordered. I'm so used to walking in, ordering a calzone, and getting one. But another Like would be the Specials for Pickup/Dine In, big difference from the Delivery Rate."
0,"I had been to 40th St. Cafe a few times previous to my last visit and thought quite highly of the place, however, my last (and final) visit was a total nightmare...I got food poisoning for the first time of my life and have finally been able to keep solids/liquids down.  I would not wish food poisoning on my worst enemy. \n\nFWIW, I had the ultimate skillet for breakfast (I know - it sounds gross just saying it), so I'd surely recommend to tready lightly with the meat if you visit this spot.  \n\nAdditionally, the service was lousy and there were a lot of weird vibes/negative energy around the place.\n\nI opted not to report this to the health department and decided to post to Yelp instead."
0,I wish zero stars were an option!! I'm only writing this review to warn potential diners of the horrible service and mediocre at best food. I drove thru the lady ''maribel'' was rude as possible I ordered two combos one rolled tacos BEEF with extra cheese and guacamole on the side. When I got my food she gave me one of each little salsa and I double checked by asking her that my rolled tacos were indeed beef not chicken. Then I had to ask for my side of guacamole again which she made obvious was a real hassle for her. Get home chicken rolled tacos with barley any cheese. Don't waste your time and money Maria's taco shop is right across the street.
0,"Probably the worst Embassy I have stayed at (and unfortunately I stay here often for business related trips).  This is the older model Embassy that looks like a reformed apartment complex.  Rooms need a facelift much like the lobby is currently getting.  The staff is decent, rooms are relatively clean.  I would look at other options if vacationing in Tempe though."
1,"Pro golf instructor Brian Crawford is as good as it gets, he got me back on track in 6 lessons. He is patient and friendly.  Very knowledgable in all aspects of the game.  The store has all a golfer needs at market costs.  I got a one year membership and practice INDOORS several times a week which is very nice in the summer.  At most driving ranges a bucket of balls is $8  at a average of twice a week, my membership was paid for in 3 months."

1,"Be prepared to spend a lot. \n\nI was really excited to try Heritage after all the hype. We had a group of 6 on a Friday night. Didn't know they took reservations, so we waited in the bar area for about an hour. Tight space, not much waiting room. Only bar area tables are for \""walk-ins\"" and most tables in the area seat 2 or 4. \n\nGreat cocktails, friendly bar staff. The Angostura Sour was well balanced and the Aviation was delicious. We ordered a cheese plate which was good (nice touch with honey comb), but overpriced. Our waiter was phenomenal! Super friendly and attentive without being annoying. \n\nSimilar sentiments with the food once we were finally seated. We ordered some of the more odd selections (trotters and escargot, octopus and fried cocks combs) as well as some not-so-odd (deviled eggs, pork belly and sashimi). All were pretty delicious, but felt like it was a bit overpriced. Few vegetarian options. \n\nI'd try Heritage again. Definitely more of a special occasion kind of place, rather than a standard staple. Looks like they change their menu frequently, which is nice."
1,"My husband and I got married here 5 years ago. We were so happy with everything. The grounds are beautiful, staff is professional, was everything we could have asked for. Yes it is a long drive but well worth it, there nothing like it in Phoenix"

0,"David Burke you should be ashamed to have you name on this hellhole! So we didn't eat here, we walked out after 15 minutes of waiting for the one and only waiter to even acknowledge us.  It was fairly packed with travelers, on a Saturday morning , serving breakfast only .  4 people seated next to us complaining loudly none of their food correct, and not good.  Head to California Pizza Oven, great happy wait staff!"
1,"PIta Pit is another of my work lunch favorites. From the falafel to the cheese pitas, I've never been lead astray by anything on their menu. The tzaziki sauce is as good as it gets, and the staff will get generous with it if you keep asking for more. I like to get my sandwiches so stuffed that I can barely get my mouth around the freakin' things.\n\nThe food is good, which means that the lines are long during lunch hour, so only try to go if you've got time. This little strip of Tryon makes me happy because there's several options close together: Soho Bistro for excellent Chinese takeout at reasonable prices and Fuel Pizza are the Pita Pit's next door neighbors. It's a great little area to go get something for everyone in your office.\n\nMost of the time, I'd land at the Pita Pit for the wide variety of veggie options. Their pita bread, also, is a miracle of food science. It's stretchy and bready at the same time. I wish I could have these things at home."
0,"Unfortunately I did not get a chance as an out of town guest to even try the food.  Was greeted at door by a bald gentleman who I found out later was the supposed manager or duty and who treated us horribly.  He was very condescending, rude and went out of his way to make me and my friends feel unwanted in this establishment.  It saddens me that he is the manager and took money from his employees pockets as we left and found a better place that was more than happy to serve us.  If you don't like your job sir find a new one.  You should easily loose your job for the way you made me and my friends and even other patrons that came in behind us feel."
1,"We came here with a group of 50 people for a wedding rehearsal dinner.\n\nFor around $56 a person, we got the All You Can Eat salad/seafood bar, all you can eat meats brought to you (tri tip, sirloin, filet, bacon wrapped turkey, chicken, pork) side dishes (mashed potatoes, saut\u00e9ed mushrooms, garlic bread, corn on the cob) and dessert.\n\nThe food was amazing and the service was outstanding. The servers come around consistently with different meats on a stick and accouterments and my plate was never empty. Who likes meat on a stick? This girl.\n\nThe only complaint I have is that they garnish everything at the salad bar with green onions. Every single dish, including the lobster bisque, is sprinkled with nasty green onions. Not everyone cares for the taste of raw onions, so maybe just put them on the side for people who want them? Garnishing dishes with green onions is lazy and unimaginative. Just sayin'."
1,I always stop here when I come visit Vegas. Located near the casino and elevators at the Venetian.\n\nI looooove the shrimp scampi pasta (i think that's what it's called)\nLinguini noodles with GINORMOUS grilled and partially battered shrimp with a light white wine sauce and tomatoes.\n\nwe usually have to wait to be seated esp post club time... sometimes i get a little dizzy because of the floral smell -- i dont wanna smell flowers when I eat my shrimp!\n\n-1 for slippery floors!!! I always fear that I'll eat it real bad when I walk around here.\n\nYUM YUM YUM. \n\nYou get what you pay for and maybe a little bit more.
1,"This is a great place to see a concert. I went with my son to see Rival Sons last  night and the atmosphere worked perfectly to enhance the experience. The is plenty of standing room in front of the stage, tabled seating off to the left and the right, and raised VIP seating just behind the tabled seating. A full bar ran across the back wall. \n\nWe will definitely be keeping an eye on and heading back  to the Pressroom. A great time at a great location!"
0,"Ten members of my family made reservations for Sunday brunch today for mother's day! Horrible experience for service and especially the food! First off for 35 dollars per person their hardly was any food out, and what was out was dried out and hardly edible. So right off the bat 3 people in our party decided against doing the brunch because of how bad it looked so they ordered from the menu. I would love to tell you how that was but they never received their food. The rest of us still tried the brunch because the waitress promised more food...nothing got better even down to not having any plates. They weren't even busy so I don't know what happened with that. Worst part was we told the waitress how we felt and I'm sure she could see how displeased we were and didn't even offer to make things right...so after 230.00 Bill we left hungry and angry. By the way at least 2 different customers were nodding their head and felt how we did...do yourself a favor pay 10 bucks more and hit up the Phoenician for mother's day brunch."
1,"Great gym if you're not looking for the mega mall type gyms like 24 hour fitness. Never really more than 10 people when I go. Have all the equipment you really need! I also feel very safe going here after hours its in a good area and all the people that go are really nice, no creepos. I don't know why someone wrote about about problems with the staff, the only guy that works here (that I know of) is the manager who is helpful, nice, and funnily sarcastic (in a good way)."
0,"This place is your run of the mill older / outskirt large casino. Comparable to a Coast casino or something like that if you are picking up what I'm throwing down.\n\nIt's great for a cheap game of craps and a way to spend some time with old folks. After my experience I'm not sure if I'd throw anymore money at the food here, but at least they've got a theater to burn some time at too."
1,"We at there on a Friday morning for breakfast and were seated promptly, even though the place was packed. It was very loud with people trying to yell over the music but hey, it's the Hard Rock!\n\nOrdered the eggs benedict and it was perfectly cooked. The hash browns were also very good, but the iced tea was weak - next time I'll just order water!\n\nI would recommend this place to anyone looking for a quick bite to eat; unless they have a hangover, then bring earplugs!"
0,"I wanted to give this nail salon a try because my mom loves it here. My mom made an appointment for both of us today, 9/25 at 4PM. We walk in and my mom goes up to the nail tech and she said we have an appointment to get our nails done and he said he had a appointment at 4PM. My mom said she made the appointment and the nail tech said \""okay pick a color.\"" I continue to pick a color and another customer walked in that the employees knew because this customer received a very warm welcoming. She said she had a appointment at 4PM. Me and this customer argued about having an appointment and the receptionist even questioned when I made the appointment and told me I could wait. I told them what's the point of making an appointment, I don't even want them doing my nails, and I'll go somewhere else. This place has the worst service. They could have easily accommodated me and the other customer but sided with their regular customer and even chose to question/argue when I made the appointment. I will never recommend this place to anyone. The treatment was just horrible. They only care about their regulars instead of taking care of new customers."
0,"I got MERSA while staying at Mandalay Bay so did my son who is 5. We were in the pool for 6 days and in rooms 32215 and 23334 wouldn't stay in these rooms until there cleaned really well and wouldn't go back in the pool unless I saw the water tests. I still haven't heard back from Mandalay Bay. Very poor customer service.\n\nJim Larson  \nTracy, CA"
0,"Average. Service is slow inside.  You have to flag someone down if you sit at a table.  Food was so so, price is high for what you get."
0,"I usually order the pokey stix from here and recently I have noticed a big decline in quality. After eating the food, I usually feel pretty sick. In fact, one of my friends even came down with the fever. Another thing that annoyed me was that the lids on the pizza sauce were melted and on top of the pokey stix. Why don't they just give the cups separately in a bag instead of placing them inside the damn box. I am going to also contact local health departments because something fishy must be in those ingredients."
0,"My last comment was filtered, even though I left legitimate feedback.  So I'll soften it up a bit.  The one good thing about this place are the constant deals they have.  Other than that, I recommend checking out a different tanning location in the area.  There is a major management/staffing problem.  Customer service doesn't seem to be too important here.  If you're told to wait 5 minutes for a bed, expect to wait 20 if not more."
1,"Sin City Wings really is a one-of-a kind wing experience. I've never experienced food that's as hot, yet bursting with flavor. I was also unfamiliar with the concept of a \""naked\"" wing, meaning there isn't any breading - absolutely delicious. \n\nBeing from out of town, I also got to learn more about some of Vegas' locals. The wings are named after several iconic figures, including the Oscar Goodman, which was my favorite wing and extremely hot, yet flavorful. I also have to mention the pot stickers because they are awesome and rolled in the same spicy sauce as the wings.\n\nIf you're cruising around the strip and happen to see the yellow wing truck, I would definitely recommend giving it a try!"
1,"Fun place to shoot the shit with some friends while avoiding the madness of clubbing, gambling, and the rest of the debauchery at Vegas.  Bartenders are cool.  Decor is nifty.  Atmosphere isn't overbearing."
0,"This place is only awesome if you are one of three things: 1. an Ohio State fan, 2. a metrosexual, or 3. someone trying to hook up with an Ohio State fan or metrosexual...Everyone else, do yourself a favor and go to any one of the many hundreds of awesome bars in old town that will happily accommodate the general public."
1,"The 2 hot dog combo is a great deal - Chicago-style dogs are so expensive around here, so 2 dogs, really good fries and a drink for $6 works for me.  I also tried the Italian Beef and it was just right - just like home.  Our service was excellent both times we've visitied.  I would go five stars, but this weekend my wife ordered the \""double dough\"" pizza and I tried it - pretty disapointingly dry bland crust.  I'm certainly going to try the deep-dish sometime...maybe I'll change my review after that - 5star if it's great and down to 3 if it stinks."
1,"I am n my husband staying in TI so they gave us 2 for 1 flyer , we decide to check it out since we was really hungry after tour . \nI order $37 plate of mixed seafood \""seven seas\"" and he got \""Cajun seafood pasta  \"" $24. Both entrees was defiantly worth of money  . My dish was flavorful with bunch of stuff in , and I tried his dish I liked as well , pasta had some nice Sauce and bunch of little crawfish tails in it , just be carefully for  jalape\u00f1o pepper ;) I bit one and my mouth was on fire ! \nAlso got the mojito $6. And my husby got lemonade . So total bill was $78 and they minus second entree -$27. So for both we paid $51. Not bad .\nThe service was average . Ok I would say , nothing special , but the waiter was on top of what he doing . \nI liked this place! \nRecommend to try ;)"
0,"I love Panera Bread, but this location started out strong and kind of went down. The drinks area is always dirty, many times the French bread that comes with the meals is dry (like cut earlier in the day and all the ends are dry).  I wished they step up a bit to keep up with the standard of the brand. Otherwise friendly staff."
0,"My wife and I went for dinner on Saturday night. It was her birthday and she was eager to use a $25 Dollar Gift Certificate. We love Sushi and we hadn't tried \""Hon Machi Sushi\"". The server was very nice and was very helpful which made it easy for us to overlook the \""extremely\"" sticky table that had to be wiped down twice. We are not that type of people and I was very reluctant to ask, however, it was so bad that i looked around to see if there was a camera crew ready to jump out and laugh at us. My hand literally made a noise as I \""pealed' it from the table. \n\nWith that said, I again, was pleased with the servers attempts to help. On with the evening... They displayed several types of Cold Saki and the one I DID want, which is a personal favorite, was really a Sample bottle for Display only. Ok, I can dig that... time to order... Sushimi and Rolls all came out at the same time... we never were served the appetizers we ordered so I very nicely cancelled them... along with the plate of shrimp tempura and rice plate that my wife ordered and never received... \n\nOk, now, skip to the bill. We rendered the $25 gift certificate at the time of the order... basically, we had to order $45 worth to get the $25 off. We were then informed that the alcohol does not apply... ok... I can understand that , but in looking at the bill to order the \""5\"" dollars in food to put us up... we discovered that they were charging us for the things they didn't serve us ??? The appetizers and the main dish that never arrived... Ok, now my \""keystone cops\"" radar is alerting me... we reluctantly order about 15$ worth of food and wait for it to go... we get the bill and it's not correct and we lost the will to fight it... we were double charged for the main dish..!!!! we paid twice ...for something we never received. \n\nBy the way, food quality was \""ok\"". Service aside, I would not return for the Sushi... there are some fantastic Sushi Restraints within a stones throw that are much much better. Voting with my Checkbook, no thanks in the future... \n\nDon't fall for a 25$ certificate btw..."
0,"Just had breakfast here with my sisters and mother for mother's day. Understandably, this day is one of the busiest for brunch-goers, but we were pleasantly surprised when we arrived a little after 9am and were seated immediately. The waitress promptly brought over coffee, even though only one of us drinks coffee.\n\nThe menu has many options, typical of breakfast joints throughout the city. That's all the good I have to say about this place! When we finally received our food, the eggs were incredibly inconsistent from one plate to the other. Three of us ordered 2 eggs over. Out of the 6 eggs we received, at least half of them were undercooked, with the whites being way too runny. Now I like a runny yoke, but I draw the line at a runny white... That is unacceptable when serving eggs, unless you request your eggs to be over easy, which we didn't! To add insult to injury, one of us also had pancakes with our egg plate and the pancakes were burnt on one side... When we asked for a manager, we were told she was busy... She finally came over and when we explained what happened she just said we should not have eaten it... We then told her we didn't eat it and we refused to pay for one of the plates.\n\nThe waitress suddenly became very rude and didn't say a word to us while making us pay and she didn't even give my mother a flower for mother's day, which was a custom we noticed as soon as we walked in... Very rude, and I will more than likely never go back again!"
0,"I was intrigued by the great reviews of Pita House. A good middle eastern restaurant is difficult to find. \n\nUnfortunately, Pita House falls short. Falafel was not very good. Tastes bland and a bit stale as if it was sitting around for awhile. The pita bread was not fresh at all, way too chewy.  The service was actually really good.. Maybe I caught them on a bad day, because the place looked authentic and the reviews seemed favorable.\n\nI was very disappointed.\n\nBy the way, my standard for falafel is Mamoun's Falafel in Manhattan, NY with 1000+ reviews. That's how falafel is done..."
0,"The BurGR is a beautifully set out restaurant and full of lots of sharp-looking waitstaff, and despite a lengthy line for group-dining, as a single I was able to sit right down at the bar.  I ordered one of the special burger offereings, the uber cheeseburger medium well.  I think of burger-medium well as \""no pink in the middle,\"" or passably the tiniest bit of pink in the middle as ground beef should be cooked much more thoroughly than, say, a beef steak.  Many restaurants will not even have a medium-rare burger as an option owing to the chance of food poisoning from undercooked hamburgers.  When the burger arrived 25 minutes later, it looked gorgeous on its puffy roll, with the cheese nicely melted and the beef sporting a glazed, glistening look.  But the first bite into the burger crushed my enthusiasm.  If the burger was 1/2 inch thick, then the middle 1/4 inch all the way through the burger was pink.  2 days later I am comfortable stating that the burger did not make me sick, but for a guy's whose reputation is built on quality control, how he let this burger come out of his kitchen so underdone is a mystery.  I'll be curious to see what other reports come out of this restaurant."
0,This is a scam... They're pretending to be another shop and they're really sunwest auto trying to rip you off. The real Simon and sons is a dif number and address. I was ripped off and both shops were caught in lies when confronted. Going to the better business bureaus to file complaint
0,"Apparently las Vegas does not have tacos at there burger king. I stood in line and when it was my turned I ordered 4 tacos and the girl looked at me as though I was crazy. She did not know what I was talking about, I told her tacos, you know like in jack in the box and she responded \"" we don't have tacos, try a Mexican restaurant\"". I couldn't believe she was so rude. However, I notice that las Vegas restaurants don't carry alto of the stuff restaurants in California do."
0,Very nice rooms but they charged me extra $500+ on some room charge i did not make... they said they filed a claim challenge but took the money from my account 3 months later and that was suppose to be my rent money...  signature on the receipt was clearly not mine but charge me anyways i will never stay here again
0,"Wanting to eat at the best restaurant in the Luxor prior to a show, I picked Tender although I was less than excited about its (and other Luxor restaurants) reviews. Those less than stellar reviews are justified.\n\nMy filet was ordered medium rare and arrived medium/medium well. It was sent back and I recieved a replacement that was closer to rare, but acceptable. The red wine sauce that was brought out with the first steak was left instead of being replaced or reheated for the new steak.\nThe meat (and sauce for that matter) was lacking in flavor. \n\nThe wife's seafood sampler of crab, salmon, a whitefish and something else was well presented but also lacking in flavor.\n\nThe sides of truffled mashed potatoes and mac and cheese (I have a carbohydrate deficiency if you must know) were above average, but certainly not nearly as good as those at other steakhouses like Bellagio's Prime.\n\nNext time, if this is the best restaurant at the Luxor I would eat elsewhere instead."
1,"Saw Adam Carolla here last week (who by the way was hilarious). We had dinner reservations (you come for dinner and get priority seating).  Got there about 30 minutes after doors opened (an hour and half before show start time) and the place was already packed.  We got seats on the 1st floor but toward the back - good view nonetheless (and Adam actually walked right by me and gave me a high five).\n\nOrdered the calamari to start - very tasty.  For dinner I had the pasta alfredo with portabello (yummy) and husband had the prime rib (he enjoyed it).  Had a couple cocktails and a couple beers.  Bill came to something like $130! YIKES! \n\nService was great, food was great, drinks were great, prices not-so-great!!!\n\nWould love to come back again but will have to be more mindful of what we order so we don't spend an arm and a leg.  FYI, the portions are large for the entrees so they could easily be shared between 2 people."
0,Firstly i need to say the actors were very talented and all 2 stars are for them.  But the over the top and disgusting toilet humor and perverted sex jokes in this play made it unbearable.....

0,"They should change the name to the SUXor because this place sucks.\nSnotty desk staff will take your 20 and still look at you as if you just took a dump on their counter, plus you will get NOTHING from them, so save your money and don't tip the desk staff expecting anything.\nThe rooms are DARK like so dark you can't read a book comfortably.\nThere are no full mirrors in the rooms, no minibar or minifridge.\nMy television was missing a remote control which took 3 calls and 5 hours to rectify.\nThe elevators incline at a very strange angle and it feels like you are on a ride at an amusement park only it isn't amusing.\nThe plumbimg made a clanging noise all night and day \n\""it's in the pipes\"". It was like Chinese water torture.\nThe buffet at Pharaoh's Pheast was less than memorable, and don't go by what it says on the main floor, cause quite a few of the items that were supposed to be on the buffet were no where to be found.\nAlso, stay close to your room if you eat here, I was running for the bathroom not long after eating.\nThe internet connection they offer is neither cheap nor reliable as I kept getting disconnected and had to keep logging back in. \nThere are many other places to stay that look like they are better maintained, this place looks good a first glance, but a closer look will reveal that it is not worth it.\nI once stayed at the Embassy Suites here, and would go back there before coming back to the Luxor.\nActually most people I've spoken with like Alladin, Harrah's or MGM on the strip.\nOff the strip, the Hard Rock is great as is the Palms.\nAs for the Suxor, well, I've learned my lesson."

And now the details...\nWe made the mistake of not looking up this store on Yelp when we happened by it after going elsewhere in the same shopping center (The Dump).  We found a kitchen table that fit the bill for the size we had in mind.  We had a very friendly salesman and worked out a price that we could stomach and purchased the set.  Next, how to get this set into our kitchen.  We had two options: 1. have it delivered for a fee or 2. pick it up.  Well, I had a vehicle large enough to accommodate the set, so I wanted to do that.  What's that you say?  I have to go way out to the Avenues to pick it up?  Hogwash!  We opted to pay delivery and not have to don our Kevlar vests to make the pickup.  (OK, I favor the East Valley- sue me).  \nThat is where things went sideways.  \nThe \""warehouse\"" folks did not call the day before our scheduled delivery, which concerned me as that was the one thing I was promised as the time was a range.  No call within a couple hours of delivery so I called the store, who got me the warehouse number.  When I called, I was told that the set was on the truck and on the way.  I confirmed the address and they had the wrong name AND address.  They were trying to deliver my set to some guy out in the WV.  They rerouted the truck and they eventually arrived after 5:00PM when we had a morning delivery scheduled.  \nUpon assembly, they quickly left and we took some time to inspect the merchandise.  There were two issues: 1. one chair wobbled due to a leg being about 1/2\"" shorter than the rest.  The second issue was in relation to a bench that came with the set.  It had a upholstered seat and it appeared a box had been placed on it, leaving a depression that was pretty severe.  We gave it 24 hours to even out, but it didn't.  We then called the warehouse and were asked by a skeptical sounding lady to text her pictures of the bench so she can make sure ACME (the manufacturer) would do a replacement.  Instead, we stopped by the store to let them know the issues we had with the delivery.  The customer service manager was very friendly and helpful.  He ordered new legs for the chair and another bench.  The legs came into the store, and I picked those up but there would be a wait for the bench.  Again, they did not call to confirm the delivery window when the promised date arrived.  When I called the warehouse to confirm again, I was told that they ALWAYS call.  I begged to differ but again, she was skeptical.  By the time we got the replacement bench delivered, nearly a month had passed since the original purchase.  Notably, the new bench cushions looked a little different than the other (it was much less loosely covered).\n\nOverall, the store experience was decent (at least I was told what they thought that I wanted to hear), the product quality was mediocre but the delivery process and warehouse employee made me want to...write a review on Yelp."
1,"I can not say enough good things about this resturant. \n\nMy father took me here several weeks ago, for lunch one Saturday afternoon. \nNow, my father loves trying small, locally owned resturants WITHOUT reading reviews on Yelp... so when he picks resturants I am always nervous. \n\nHowever, I was completly blown away by this location. \nI had the chili cheese burger, and the chili was the right amount of spice, and the sweet potato tots were to DIE for. \n\nBut the best, BEST part of this resturant, are the sauces. \n(I had no idea what they call them... something-yokie?!) \nBut I was literally begging them to start selling the sauces to go, because the chipotle sauce of tasty goodness was so amazing. I dunked my tots, I smothered my burger. \nIt was so amazing. \n\nAdditionally, the waitress was bubbily, and fun, and very very attentive. \n\nThis is what a locally owned burger joint should be. \n\nIf I could give this resturant 10 stars I would. \n\nSELL YOUR SAUCES by the bottle! I'd go broke trying them all :)"
0,Not for business travelers. Poor cell phone connectivity is a known issue by the staff and for all those that need to make business calls from their room or anywhere within the hotel.  I had to leave early and spend the day to work out of one of the airport lounges. No kidding!! When's the last time you had to pay for using the land line in your hotel room?
1,The chicken tikka masala is a great favorite.  My two kids (ages 4 and 7) eat it like it's ice cream. \nThe restaurant was hopping...a great new Indian restaurant on the west side.
0,"Shame on the Cosmopolitan Hotel for overselling the Adele concert last Saturday (August 20th) that it ALMOST ruined the experience of Adele.  \n\nI had a General Admission ticket for a concert where doors opened at 8:30.  I arrived at 5 PM and waited in line for hours so that I could have a chance of having a prime spot- front and center.  Little did I know that \""VIP tickets\"" were sold giving holders access to that prime spot.  If I would have known those were available, I would have shelled the extra money because I don't like to wait in line for hours on end. We were let in at 8 PM and I, along with other cray Adele fans,  ran to find my perfect spot.  I was about 3 rows of people back.  Not bad. And I had a great view in between the heads of 2 tall people in front of me. \n\nBut once it started to fill up, claustrophobia began to set in.  We were packed tighter than a can of sardines.   But, what made it worse was the fact that there were \""VIP ticket holders\"" who had just arrived and there was no space left in front of the stage.  Security actually tried to tell us to take 2 steps back.  Are you kidding me?!?!?!  It's a million degrees, we are sweating, and packed so tight- where do you expect us to move?  I closed my eyes and TRIED to take deep breaths because fresh air was limited at my low altitude level- while being pushed and shoved left and right, front and back.  \n\nI had to keep telling myself it would be all worth it once Adele performed.  And it was.... for a while at least.  Adele was amazing when she finally came on at 10:30 PM.  So after standing (since 5 PM), I almost passed out 45 minutes into Adele's set and just had to get out of there.  Unfortunately, it took me FOREVER to get to the exit door to get fresh air because it was so crammed in there.  A definite FIRE HAZARD.  In fact, a few people had to leave because they were feeling faint.  When I finally got out, I knew that it would be a b*tch to get back in so I left early instead.  (At least i was able to avoid the flood of people exiting).  I have learned my lesson- NEVER AGAIN will I purchase a General Admission ticket at the Chelsea.  I'll pay for the bleacher seats and bring binoculars instead."
1,"I stayed at this hotel with my family of 5 for the night.  We have 3 boys and they loved the room.  We had a suite that had a separate room for them.  The rooms are beautifully decorated and have big flat screens.  \n\nThe pool was small, but we were the only people there so it wasn't a problem.  We skipped the hotel breakfast since there are so many great places in Madison to go to eat (Monty's).\n\nFree Wi-Fi is always nice and I was surprised by the quality of the room for the price we paid.  It's obvious the building is relatively new and it's kept in good condition."
1,"Their quality of ramen is pretty good. I'm not completely sold to choosing them over Monta, but their slice of pork is pretty thick and impressive! Also tender. I highly recommend their tonkatso miso ramen as I love that nice thick broth. It was filled with corn, green onions, and medium boiled egg. \n\nThe noodles have a nice chew to it. Not too soggy and not too under cooked either. The broth was full of flavor. The pork had that nice consistency of chewiness, and the ramen all together was full of flavor. \n\nI also recommend the fried gyoza as a side, and their homemade kimchee. Not up for ramen. I highly RECOMMEND the Chasu bowl (pork and white rice, with ginger). It's so delish and it too is full of flavor. It has a very subtle sweetness to it which I love and is also very tender and nicely marinated. I think if the ramen doesn't win me over from Monta, I'd say their Chasu bowl does. \n\nThe vibe also brings out that nice grassroots local Japanese feel with the small establishment, wooden seats, and specials hand written and posted on the walls. The location is very off from what most typical Japanese restaurants are, and is a bit out of the way for me, but if you're in that side of town or have that nice gap between classes from UNLV it would be a nice place for lunch. I have yet to try their sesame broth which I think is also one of their signature ramen bowls. I'm not fond of the sesame flavor though as those flavors are typically too strong for my taste buds. If you do, definitely let me know how it is!"
0,"Well....the chocolate pudding was good!  \n\nThis place has a lot of hype surrounding it and despite being an enormous fan of the Austin style BBQ joint in Phoenix, Little Miss BBQ (see my review and all the other 5-star reviews surrounding it), I was willing to give it a shot.  \n\nThe line didn't bug me and I was ready to wait knowing this is how Texas style BBQ is, but just know you will wait a bit because of the way they slice and serve their food.  My hubby and two friends and I grabbed one of the metal buckets and filled it with yeasty beverages while we waited.  \n\nLet me just preface this entire review now (as if the first sentence didn't already cover it)...I have two simple words to describe it.  Dry. Bland. Dry. Bland. Dry. Bland. Dry. Bland.  Does that about cover it?\n\nWe decided on half a pound each of the pork spare ribs, fatty brisket, and one house made jalapeno sausage along with some coleslaw, beans, and chocolate pudding.  The coleslaw was insanely bland.  What am I talking about?!  The entire tray of meat was everything but flavorful.  \n\nAs soon as they put the ribs on our tray, I turned to my husband and asked him, \""What the heck is that?\""  It was gray and looked like cardboard.  The fatty brisket they laid down was a lousy excuse for fatty brisket.  As a brisket expert, my husband realized their \""fatty brisket\"" is actually the lower part of the point, which is dry and normally chopped and served on sandwiches because it isn't pretty and it certainly isn't fatty.  The link looked hopeful though.  I totally dug the hot carrots!!!  \n\nSo, Texas BBQ is supposed to not require any sauce at all.  But this stuff had to be doused in it!  I had to bathe my meat in it for goodness sakes.  There was absolutely no flavor to any of the meat and no seasoning (and by that I mean salt and pepper) in sight.  \n\nNever will I ever go back to Rudy's.  And I am NOT just writing this subpar review because of LMB...I honestly and truthfully was grossed out and extremely let down by the appearance, taste, and lackluster flair of their food. Sure Little Miss BBQ is a bit more of a drive, but their meat is juicy, flavorful, and doesn't require any sauce whatsoever.  Their sides are tasty too."
1,"I actually enjoyed this place under new management. Went on a Sunday night when it was slow. Poked my head around, the new renovations and rooftop deck with a view are great. The food (I got duck, my friend got crab cakes) was pretty good. I thought everything was fairly seasoned and cooked correctly. We also got a free sangria on the house, that was good too. The waitress was nice. Downside would be parking, that lot was tiny."

0,"I was looking forward to trying this restaurant but was very disappointed. The food was ok. Not great. But it wS the service that surprised us. When we arrived the tables around us were full. Slowly people left and the dirty dishes were left on the tables. The wIt staff didn't lift a finger to clear the tables. Really unappetizing. Our waitress never came over to check on us. She just stood around talking with a friend. I spoke to the manager and asked why the wait staff left dirty dishes unattended and was told it wasn't their job. When I left, the tables still hadn't been cleared. Speaking with the manager was ineffective. I will never return."
1,"So another first date, another restaurant that I didn't get to chose.  I'll admit, I wasn't terribly excited about going to Sapporo, seeing as it was in North Scottsdale and I had spent my day drinking with a friend at Rose and Crown.  I'm taking date pregaming to a whole new level!\n\nSo I roll into Sapporo around 9:15, 45 minutes late for my date.  Again, I don't do North Scottsdale and have no desire to visit the land of the cougars and sugar daddies.  But I figured on a Thursday night at 9 that the bar would be laid back.  Boy was I wrong.  I forgot that cougars are living off of their exes and current sugar daddies and they have kids they couldn't give two sh*ts about.  So they were out in full force, and getting very hammered and trying to dance to Lady Gaga songs.  All the money in the world couldn't buy these hags class.\n\nBut I'm here to get some free drinks and possibly some high quality sushi.  The waitress was extremely attentive and was nice enough to remind us that the kitchen does eventually close, so we should probably order.  I can't remember the exact name of the roll I order, but I went with my usual roll requirements of spicy tuna, avocado, and scallops.  I have to admit that the sushi was fresh, so no complaints here.  And seeing as I didn't have to pay, and was pretty buzzed throughout my whole date I can give this place 4 stars.  Now if I was sober and actually paid attention to the atmosphere and prices, I know this place would drop in stars.\n\nMuch love to the server Brittany!  You are absolutely adorable and a total sweetheart!"
1,Had to share an actual picture of the deliciousness this time. Mussamen chicken curry with egg. Love this menu item!
0,"I wouldn't recommend anyone stay at this Low Quality Suites. I started to stay there, but couldn't finish. Not wouldn't. Couldn't! I was able to check in, unpack, shower, change and head to a football game at ASU. That's when my stay ended and some other dude's stay began.\n\nWhen I returned from the football game my room key wouldn't work, so I went and told the front desk attendant. The manager came over and for 5 minutes they looked at their computer together, at me (separately) and then back at the computer to share a WTF moment. When they found the courage, they advised me that they had mistakenly rented the room to someone else. The manager apologized and said he could give me a free room upgrade and proceeded to check me in. I said I wanted to get my things out of the room first.\n\nI went with the manager to my/our room. The manager tried the key, but couldn't get in. The door was apparently barricaded. He tried calling the room and either didn't get an answer or didn't like the answer. He knocked on the door and said, \""This is the manager\"", but the person inside just knocked back. We shared a WTF moment. I wanted my stuff, so I called the police. \n\nI waited outside while the Tempe police went in and talked to the manager, sharing a WTF moment. The police were finally able to get my roomie to open the door and let me in to collect my things, although he resisted a bit. Seemed to be a homeless man who thought he'd made a big score. Denied. My belongings in hand, the manager again offered to put me in a \""nicer\"" room. He understood when I told him what he could do with his \""nicer\"" room. \n\nAside from the horror, the problem with the Low Quality Suites is that it is a motel-type property being passed off as a 2-star hotel on travel sites. Read the previous negative reviews. All of those complaints apply, and when you add an incompetent staff that double books a room and then doesn't know how to resolve the problem, I feel obliged to leave my first ever feedback online about a hotel. I hope nobody else has to go through that."
1,"I love the margherita pizza here!! Right amount of sauce, chunks of mozzarella cheese, and big leaves of basil! Delicious, hot, perfect!!! They get their bread from the Breadsmith off Power and McDowell. Its great!!! They have great wine, pizza, drinks and desserts! Come check out this adorable place! There is a wait on the weekends so try and get in early on the weekdays!! Their cappuccinos are delicious with some decent tiramsu! Enjoy!!!\n\nTo bad they don't deliver!!!"
0,Delicious ice cream!  Nice family owned business. Great variety and always a surprise flavor.
0,"I don't even know where to begin about our bad experience.  We walked in and stood there for 5 min and no one seated us.  So we just picked our own table.  5 minutes in they did come and take our drink and food orders.  The appetizer plates that were on the table had 2 out of 3 dirty ones. We had to ask for new ones.  I asked for a burger, no bun and sweet peppers  with mayo.  Hailey the waitress said they no longer have sweet peppers even though it's on the menu. Ok no problem. We also ordered wings with blue cheese and a Mac and cheese which looked delicious in the pic on the menu.  After 30 min still no food or a drink refill.  Wings finally come out alone, no blue cheese and the celery  was all the top of the stalks. Not even the edible part.  5 mins later the burger comes out, no mayo.  Then the Mac n cheese and it's nothing close to the pic on the menu.  We asked for a refill on our drinks and Hailey told us that she would get it \""after she settled her other guests\"".  Really?  We actually would like drinks with our dinner.  We also told her we were still missing blue cheese and mayo. About 10 mins later she returned and asked what drinks we wanted.  Instead of bringing us new glasses, she took our used cups to the back and filled them.  Gross.  She never once checked in on us- we had to flag her down. And they were not busy at all. The only time she stopped to check on us was to ask if we had a printed copy of our restaurant.com certificate in the middle of us eating.  We said no it was on our phone. And she said oh well I wanted to get your check ready.  How did she know that no one wanted another drink or dessert?  We had to waive her down at the end for the check and gave her half cash and half credit card. I asked her to split it and she said ok so all in cash and the rest on the card.   I said no, 50/50 just like I said.  She was confused.  This was the worst service that i have received in a very long time. I know it's a sports bar but it was a slow Monday night.  All in there we were there for 1.5 hours for a burger and wings.  Ridiculous."
1,"I've been meaning to write a review of how much I love Dr. Peterson and his staff, but like most people, I tend to procrastinate.  My husband however just walked into my office to tell me he'd missed a call, and it was a voice mail from Dr. Peterson personally calling to wish him a happy birthday - now that is customer service!!!\n\nWe were referred to him for an implant my husband needed done, and found everyone to be very friendly and professional.  We have returned to see him as our primary dentist and love everything about the experience (well, okay, as much as anyone can possibly love going to the dentist!).  Routine cleanings are painless, and every bit of what is being done is explained in detail so there are no surprises or uncomfortable moments.\n\nThe office and exam/treatment rooms are welcoming, the staff is super friendly and very competent, and we plan to be returning patients for many years!"
0,"After reading all the wonderful reviews for this dog groomer, I called to get pricing information. I have 2 small yorkies and was quoted $35.00 each and the first time they would have their toenails clipped free. I made the appointment and took them in. My husband then went a couple of hours later and picked them up. He was charged $90.00...not $70.00 as I was quoted. When I called to find out why I had been misled, the lady had no idea who or why I was misquoted. Wow, Really! \nThe reason I gave them 2 stars instead of 1 is because they did a good job as far as grooming went.  Just one other complaint; their listed as \""mobile pet groomers\"" on yelp but they are a brick and mortar building....again misleading."
1,"Love this place, wish they had more seating, there are only 3 tables. I like the coconut with condensed milk."
1,"This library is great! There are rooms, and rooms filled with books, movies, and CDs! Plus any books that are available at other libraries not at the library can be requested and delivered to your local library. I actually don't read a lot but I still love this library. The only problem with this library is that is is hard to find stuff."
1,"This Starbucks has an incredibly friendly staff and even better drinks! For some reason, anytime I go, everything tastes better there! It's hard to go to another location!"
0,"If 0 stars were possible I'd give em. Got back from here yesterday evening and I am physically ill. \n\nI didn't even touch the anemic, yellow and fishy smelling muscles - not that the waiter asked why we hadn't eaten them, more on this character in a moment. My ahi tuna steak was decent, but I think the scallops are what got me and my friend is sick as well. Just saying - check your food before the waiter walks off.\n\nSpeaking of the waiter - one of the worst I've ever had the displeasure of umm being served by? That sounds awkward and vaguely jack-assy ... Hmm the mild poisoning I have is affecting my wit, but you follow me.\n\nThis guy spilled half the water out of the oysters while trying to put a plate down, and didn't notice or say anything about it when he did; he asked me how I wanted my tuna steak prepared??! \n\nWorst of all he spoke in this low monotone while other customers and cars going by drown him out so all you can tell is he asked you something because he's standing there with this kind of 'come on!' look on his face - totally rude and completely inept. I was hard put to give 10% tip to be honest. \n\nI'd suggest the similar bar down the road for better quality food and service. Good luck out there!"
0,"1 word: WHY????!!!\n\nBought a Groupon for this place since I was visiting Sin City over the weekend.  There were a bunch of people standing around not doing anything, and the girl who took my order looked like she could care less about working and wanted to go home.  She wasn't friendly and neither was anybody else behind the counter.\n\nHow do you mess up a Chinese Chicken Salad wrap, How I say? For the $11 I paid I would rather have eaten my sock covered in honey Dijon mustard.\n\nThe 1 star is actually for my drink, the Moonshine w/ Everclear, which was tasty and clearly the highlight of my visit. \n\nIf you find yourself in the Miracle Mile shops and your stomach is growling, you would rather walk another mile than eat at this place."
0,"A definite meh. We live nearby and had been excited for them to open, but gave them some time to shake of the New Place Bugs. I guess they need a lot longer.\n\nThe staff was friendly, but didn't seem to know what was going on. Nearly every question resulted in a run to the kitchen to ask, and then we had to flag them down again to get the answer.\n\nLots of options, especially if you're a fan of sushi rolls. They seem to really like tempura, as we went six rolls in a row asking \""What's that one?\"" and finding out it had fried shrimp in it. Does anything scream tasty raw fish like rampant deep frying?\n\nFood came fairly quickly, and tasted okay, but then we had two more bouts of misheard requests from our server and it had passed from silly to annoying by that point. We had one regular roll, one mid-range roll from their list, and one of their top end rolls. I'm trying to recall the exact names, but I can't, which I guess tells you how memorable they were.\n\nAnd I have no idea why the place still looks like a Pizza Hut. Just not the kind of place I want to relax in and enjoy some sushi.\n\nNot horrible, just not that special. I'd almost prefer a chain like Ra over them. If you really want great sushi, look elsewhere."
0,"My food was \""ok\"" too much bun for the burger and pretty greasy. The server was very friendly and attentive and so was the bus boy. \n\nI was very offended by the owner yelling at our server, who was doing a great job,  for being \""too attentive\""  we are regulars at other restaurants typically because we enjoy the atmosphere which the server usually has a lot to do with.  He was rude and harsh! Then came back and \""acted\"" very nice to us after we just witnessed the way he treated her.\nHe should have paid more attention to the 2 servers gossiping about him at the front door. (We were seated at the 1st table and could hear their very inappropriate conversation)  We will not return and will not recommend!"
0,"My girlfriends and I just turned 21 over the past few weeks and decided to come to Hakkasan for Calvin Harris. We were all stoked because we thought it was super cool that there was an area for EDM and hip hop.\nAll in all we had a fantastic night celebrating and dancing on the 'ratchet floor' but once we went to the main area (EDM stage), things went down hill extremely quickly..\n\n1) The EDM area was EXTREMELY crowded. We were all packed in there.\n2) My girlfriends got their phones stolen and all my cash was gone within 30 min being in that area. \n\nIt makes me sad because from what I am reading here, it's not an uncommon event at Hakkasan. It makes me more sad that I'm sure they read these reviews and have not upped the security in there. I hope they try to work this situation out with security management because I really do want to come back here because I thought the light work and sound was amazing in this club.\n\nBut until then, I will be exploring other options:"
1,"Great experience. We made a last-minute reservation, Which was easily accommodated with no problem. When we arrived, We were quickly sat and ordered our drinks.This place is a carnivorous dream!! \n\nOnce you're sat, the servers explain how everything works. Everyone at the table gets a double sided coin, one side green and the other red. As long as the green side is facing up, the endless parade of steaks, sausage, roasts and ribs will keep coming! Our server was very nice and asked what our favorites were, so they would be presented first.\n\nThey also have a huge unlimited buffet that includes charcuterie, various cheeses, beans, dressings, sushi, about every type of bread, lobster bisque (which was amazing) and many hot sides. \n\nEven though we arrived closed to their closing time we were not rushed out. I even got a complementary dessert!\n\nTotal win! We will be back!"
0,"Would never easy here again.  Food is horrible.  The rice was microwaved.  What kind of retardant does this.  Who stores cooked rice in a fridge and warms it up in a microwave when some orders food?  And you can tell a lot of stuff was reheated and not cooked fresh to order.  The discoloration of chicken,  beef,  or pork is a dead give away.  \n\nI use to love this place.  Food use to be great till about 2006 or 2007. Then it just horrible now.  Rather eat fast food over this place."
1,"Keep your eyes open, I almost drove right by this place. Might have been because it's a lot more house-looking than restaurant-looking. Not complaining, just saying. I love the converted house thing, just wasn't expecting it. Or maybe it was because the Yelper I was following turned into the parking lot a moment after two cars cut in front of me and she disappeared from view. Either way, I found it, and I'm glad I did.\n\nFirst, I gotta give 'em props for the way they handled our large, unexpected and occasionally raucous group - service was friendly and efficient. Lisa G herself even came over to say hello, pose for pictures and answer detailed questions about her fabulous food. Did I just say fabulous? Weird. Not part of my typical nomenclature. Did I just say nomenclature? Did I use it correctly?\n \nAnyhoo - was part of a large group like I said, so I got to sample/steal bits and pieces of several different menu options.. cheese, cranberries, and candied almonds from the antipasto plate, shrimp and veggies from the skewer plate, more candied almonds from the antipasto plate, the empanadas - ooh, the empanadas - they were the best part. I'm not sure which I enjoyed more, the eggplant/zuchini/blue cheese & pine nuts or the Mushroom/onions/almonds & parmesan cheese.. Probably the eggplant, which is weird, because I don't normally care for eggplant. Oh, but the mushrooms were so good. Hmm.. think I'll have to go back and have them again to be sure. Lastly, we ordered the seared ahi mini-sandwiches with wasabi sauce, which I loved - though the Yelper I shared them with didn't so much. But she's crazy, you shouldn't listen to her."
1,I always pass this place on my way home and finally decided to stop in and try it. It was pretty packed which I didn't really expect. I was excited when I saw they had a vegetarian/vegan menu! The young man at counter was polite and explained a lot to us even though it started to get a lot busier. I tried the Chipotle baguette and oh my gosh it was so delicious. I also tried the Thai Tea Frapp which was also amazing. The only weird thing about this place is the location. It's surrounded by realtor/business offices  so it might be confusing the first time you go there. The service was great too and the staff were very friendly. I have to stop by again to try their teas.
1,Update: One word... COCONUT COCONUT COCONUT.\nUpdate to the update: pass on Mango - just something off about it.
0,"One of the dullest hotels I've stayed in.  Food was subpar.  Sheets smelled of mildew and A/C was not properly working.  When I woke up, I swear I thought I was in a cheap motel and not a Sheraton.  Wifi only in the lobby area.  There is free wired internet in the rooms."
1,"I read the mixed reviews so went here prepared for anything. We were looking for an excuse to visit the Cosmopolitan and support our local economy. Just to digress for a second, the parking garage was way cool. The whole thing was programmed, with readouts on the number of spots available on each level and then a red or green light above each spot to let you know where the empty ones were. It looked like Xmas!Back to the restaurant. It was small, warm, simple and inviting, with a good energy. The wait staff was excellent. Our server was friendly, knowledgeable and did all the right things. We had a bottle of 2008 Talbott Chardonnay, marked up from about $18 retail to $58 at the table, which is about par for the course. There is both free bread and bread sticks, as well as artisan breads that cost extra. The free bread was OK. and the bread sticks were really good. Started with the Coppa salumi and Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese, which came with sides of creamy honey and whole grain mustard. The cheese in particular was great. The romaine salad was crisp, but dressed just a little too lightly for my taste. The salumi/chesse and salad all came out at the same time and I would have rather that they spaced out these two servings. For entrees, my wife had the gnudi. Pillows of deliciousness, a wonderful take on the traditional gnocchi, with a light sage butter sauce. A real winner. I had the veal cutlet in a reduction sauce with grilled vegetables. The veal was cooked perfectly and had a nice crust on it. A little fatty, but that happens. Overall, very good, not great. Wrapped up the meal with the caramel budino, an Italian pudding that is rich, creamy and heavenly, with a bit of sea salt to add another layer of flavor and texture. WOW. Also had a scoop of the mint chocolate gelato, not as creamy or minty as I would have hoped for. The portions are small, but priced accordingly considering the high quality of the food. All in all, a really nice experience, and a place we wouldn't hesitate to go back to."
0,"I've been wanting to try this place since I saw it go in, so I went for happy hour with a friend. I got there quite early and sat at the bar; figured I would just have a drink until she got there. \n\nI ordered a lemon drop martini--a favorite drink, and something that most bars can handle. I have no idea what the bartender put in this. I think it was sour mix and a very small amount of vodka, based on how incredibly sweet it was. The bartender asked if it was ok; I said it tasted awfully sweet so he kindly offered to add more lemon juice. He added quite a bit more \""juice\"" from a container behind the bar and the drink tasted exactly the same--which is why I think it was sour mix. Oh well, I thought, I can stand to drink this and I'll switch to wine afterwards. \n\nThe bartender apologetically explained that he \""is not a martini person\"" and left. Fine, I get that...but this isn't a complicated drink and *you are a bartender*. \n\nI finished that drink and waited about ten minutes for the bartender to notice (again, at about 5pm on a Tuesday, when the bar was perhaps 1/4 full). He finally came over. I ordered a glass of wine. My friend texted to say she was finally on her way. Five minutes later, still no glass of wine in sight. I told her it wasn't worth coming and we met at Casbah instead.\n\nI finally flagged down the bartender ten minutes after this. He seemed to have no recollection of my wine order so I paid and left. Definitely won't be back! The specials were...nothing special, and certainly didn't rival the many better happy hours in the Shadyside area."
0,"Worst customer service ever !!!! Tweaked out employees , the stuff their selling is always badly damage , dirty , food stuck to toys car seats an shoes, no help and not friendly at all!! Plus they are so cheap when buying your stuff and if there's stuff they want they pay you even less !!! I will make the drive to surprise !!!"
1,"Cool candy store with rows of old and new candies.  Some of it I remember eating as a kid, and some I have never seen before now.  The walls are covered with cool posters of oldies but goodies, like Lucy and Three Stooges, and then there are the bottles of soda everywhere.  \n\nI counted so many different root beers, and I kept looking for the one chocolate soda I had as  a kid, but got so confused, i don't know if it was ever found.  \n\nA really cool store full of nostalgia and sweet treats."
1,Teriyaki steak was great!  Lots of Margaritas to choose from.  Our meal took a long time so our waiter bought us a coupla extra margaritas.  \n\nPeople on stilts walk around and will blow up balloons and place them on your head.  Fun time.
0,"Not sure if there have been other reports of theft in the past but when I went it was a Friday night me, my bf, my friend and his gf were staying there and we went to Marquee. Were out of the room from 9pm-2am. When we returned, my friend noticed that $400 was missing from her wallet along with the $20 that she had left out the table. Before we left we put the do not disturb sign on the door which was gone when we got back. My friend isnt dumb and you dont just misplace $400 she knew where she put her money. She filed a report and talked to head security and they said she would have to wait a week to see what could be done bc they needed investigate. Well today I talked to her and the event occurred two weeks ago and she tells me that she is not going to be reimbursed bc PH is not liable for stolen items. WTF! Thats bs coz we knew we closed the door and my friends suitcase got looked through. PH employees such as housekeeping have access to our rooms and can just steal hella sh.t. Basically PH can eat a d*ck and if you are goin to stay here and have valuables USE THE SAFE."
0,"When I eat at a Ruth's Chris, I've come to expect excellent food and even better service.  My experience at this location, however, did not meet my expectations.\n\nIt's located in a strip mall so the parking was convenient, but the fa\u00e7ade was not very impressive.  Our party of 6 came in a bit staggered and our half was not greeted by anyone, instead we had to find our way to the table where the rest of our party was seated.\n\nThe waitress was friendly, but gave the \""welcome to Ruth's Chris\"" spiel with the enthusiasm of an airline stewardess explaining how to put on a life jacket in the event of a water landing.\n\nI ordered the Crabatini which was excellent.  A friend of mine ordered the calamari for the table, though, and it seemed like someone pulled the squid out and just fried up the breading.  It also really needed a remoulade or some kind of sauce to dip the fried bits into.  \n\nShortly before our steaks arrived, an overly gruff and visibly uncomfortable server's assistant arrived to direct us to avoid touching the plates as they are 500 degrees and to hold our napkins up so we don't get splattered with the sizzling butter our steaks would be bathing in.  My ribeye steak and the rest of our party's filets arrived.  After taking my first bite, I thought, where is all of the sizzling butter I was warned about and craved?  The steak was good, but just not as great as all of the other times I've been.  My side of sweet potato casserole was as delicious as I remember though.\n\nAfter finishing about  1/2 of my ribeye and settling into a meat coma, I realized that my mild irritation with the dining experience was not being helped by the view of the other servers loafing and leaning against the front counter or the excessively hot temperature in the room.  It is Vegas in the summer time; it is alright to crank the air conditioning up!  There was no dessert for me; I just wanted to flee the scene.  \n\nI am sure I'm being overly critical but Ruth's Chris is supposed to be a top notch steak house with superb service.  Other times I've visited rated 4.5 to 5 stars; maybe this location just needs some new management.   \n\nI will return, but just not to this location."
0,"as i've mentioned, I had the unfortunate displeasure of being diverted by ambulance to this hell hole( my opinion) and being treated by joseph mengler, i mean my arch enemy chris appleton. He showed absolutely no respect, and left me in an emotionally and psychologically hole . Stay away be warned!"
1,"Ate here last night and the food and service was very good. Every body there was super friendly and helpful and they all deserve a raise. Had burratta to start which came with some grilled bread which we liked. Also had a pizza with sausage, goat cheese, mushrooms and onions. Liked the crust it was nice and light and the toppings were all of high quality. Also had sides of brussels w/ pancetta and a meatball in sauce and both were good. Other pluses were the beer list and the wine list as well as the retro diner-like ambiance. Overall I would definitely recommend this place and I will be back but I must warn people who read reviews that compare this place to Bianco that it is not at that level. Not that they themselves are claiming that its just that every time a good pizza place opens up some yelp reviewers claim that Bianco has been bested or equalled and it just isn't the case. As long as you don't go in with those expectations you will find some pretty delicious pizza and some great drinks in a nice atmosphere."
0,"This was my first restaurant I tried in Montreal, I was really hungry after getting off the plane and figured I'd go for a nice buffet.  The atmosphere is nice, service is good and there is an actual cook who will do a stir fry as you watch.   The buffet is large and had many items, lots of sushi and tons of fried and sauteed food.\n\nThe difference is in the taste:\nThe bad:\n- sushi was old and very cold, like it came out of a super cold fridge\n- Food did not look fresh when I got there at the start of the service\n- They had a roast beef that I think I had to cut myself, but one of the servers did it for me after I asked if I had to do it myself or not, she was not pleased.\n- Roast beef was also almost raw and very fatty.\n- Noodle dishes were ok, looked old but still ok\n- Egg rolls are plain and fatty from oil\n- All the other dishes looked the same color and not appetizing.\n\nThe good:\n- Fast service\n- Nice atmosphere\n- Took AMEX \n\nPlease, please, please, Fu Lam, please listen to your customers, you will not stay open for very much longer if this does not change.\n\nFull buffet came up to 24$ with tip (water, no drinks)"
0,"$171 CASH ONLY for a five mile tow. Need i say more? Reason for the CASH only, nobody would allow this purchase to go through."
0,Served me Pork Spring-rolls even thought I ask for no PORK!!!!\nWas hungry and thought I made myself clear that I did not want any meat in my food.\nOnce I started eating my  food I thought it was tasting odd.\nServer was like oh mistakes happen.\nSeriously annoyed with poor judgement.
1,"Yo Rita has been my favorite \""fancy\"" taco place in Pittsburgh since it replaced the Iguana Grill. Since then, other places have opened (Smoke, Round Corner), but no one else seems to be able to pull of the experimental taco thing quite like Yo Rita.\n\nThe ever-changing menu keeps the samplings fresh and when you find one...or two...or three...or in my case, FOUR tacos that you love, you need to get back as much as possible because they won't last for too long. As my wife found out, her favorite - the brussel sprout taco - disappeared with the seasonal menu update after only getting to enjoy it twice. Unfortunately, that's the way it's played, folks. Haha.\n\nThe starters are also usually really good. On the current menu, the albondigas (bison meatballs) are excellent - albeit a bit spicy - and the patatas bravas are tasty! I just wish they'd bring back the mini chorizo corn dogs. Amazing.\n\nI would give Yo Rita 5 stars, but with the experimentation sometimes comes tacos that just don't work for me. That's not to say they won't be awesome to other people, though. There's also the rare occasion where the quality seem inconsistent. For example, we went last night to try the new menu, and the rock shrimp taco seemed to have shrimp shell in it. The flavors were good, but no one likes shell. Of course, the rest of my tacos were excellent...and considering I ate 5 tacos, 4 out of 5 great ones makes my rating easy to figure out.\n\nYo Rita also has some excellent daily taco specials and great mixed drinks...oh and the free chips and salsa are awesome!\n\nThe service is also a positive. They don't have a lot of waitstaff, but the small team usually does an incredible job, and the food comes out quickly.\n\nThe cost adds up quickly, though, and it's tempting to order a lot. You do get a ton of food in each taco, but I know a lot of people who will look at a single taco costing $9 and feel ripped off, BUT since Yo Rita packs each taco with a lot of meat and a lot of quality, I've never felt like it was overpriced at all.\n\nOverall, it's definitely worth checking out!"
0,Shouldn't even get 1 star. My husband and I went here looking for a dresserto match bedroom furniture we have. We found something we wanted to purchase and waited almost 30 minutes for a sales person to help us then were told they would call us the next day with the pick up date and time. No call the next day or 3 days following. We called and all calls go to voicemail no-one returned our messages. We called every store in the valley and no-one returned our call. Horrible service I DO NOT recommend.
0,"As I've stated previously I'm not much of a club person...scratch that, I'm not at all a club person. In Las Vegas however, I can get talked into it, especially if it's with the girls. \n\nThe Bank is suppose to be a new, upscale club (or at least I thought) but I was somewhat disappointed. First, outside there is no order. There is no set line, and I was told to make my way to the front so the bouncer could see me and my party to let us in. It ended up working, but I'd rather not elbow my way to the front of a mass. I'd rather wait in line and if the bouncer chooses to escort my party to the front, so be it. Once inside I was disappointed by the crowd. Seemed younger and sorry for saying, a bit ghetto. I wasn't a huge fan of the bubble foam falling from the ceiling every 20 minutes or so. I had to put my hand over my glass to keep out the suds...kinda gross.\n\n There wasn't much breathing room at this club, especially since it has a sunken dance floor, so no extra space to spill out onto. Next time I get talked into a club in Vegas I'd rather go back to Pure or try somewhere new."
0,Its SO bad! I dont know what kind of LSD the other reviewers were on (obviously the GOOD stuff) but seriously its THAT bad. Stay away!
1,I am skeptical about nail salons & fungus...I have to say I love to see the nail techs clean & sanitize the chairs & foot baths after each customer. And I love to see the autoclave sitting right there in the salon. I will always go to Elite Nails!
0,I only give this place 1 star because zero is not available.  Love their food but today I sat at the bar. Waited 15 min for a beer and asked to see a certain hockey game the second I sat down. Once my food order came they had still not changed tvs. Had to eat my wings standing up in the middle of the bar while the manager changed tvs for 3 or 4 other people. Maybe he is a prick or maybe he's not a wings fan. Either way F this place
1,"Jim did a great job. I just moved into an older town home that had a list of minor repairs that were needed. He was able to help with everything, walked me through each step of the way, and was very knowledgeable. He quoted me a price that was more than fair and just did a phenomenal job. I would definitely recommend him for any of your home needs."
0,"I am all for value and a discount room but please don't make false claims.  This place proudly displays four starson a placard just outside the front door.  This must be from a bygone ere because I am pretty sure to rate four stars you must have a bell hop and concierge, tow things that were lacking. Also lacking is a seperate staff elevator for the maids, so good luck getting around during check out hours.  The staff gave a poor performance. EXAMPLE = They did not have a concierge but the front desk person told me she could handle reservations, when I called to check on them I was told that the resturant was not open during her entire shift - I cant accuse her of lieing but when I checked with the resturant they assured me they are open from the morning until 3am. Never have I run into this type of customer service, worse yet is the place dosnet seem like it is structured to offer much in the way of redress.  I will simply vote with my pocket book and avoid staying here even if it is a little cheaper.  The upside however is the area.  You are a few blocks away from the Guy-Concordia metro stop which is good for accessing most points in Montreal.  There are some great eats near by, as welll and Al-Taib pizza if you are really slumming it!"
1,"I usually stick to either the BBQ Chicken or the cutlet whenever I go to Hawaiian places like this, but this time I decided to try the Mahi Mahi.  I was not disappointed.  The fish was nice and flaky and not oily.  I also got a good amount of food for my money.  I am definitely happy this place is close to one of the stations I work at.  They have a pretty wide selection, but I would love to see some scallops here.  Good food, good prices, clean kitchen and nice people."
1,"My first pick for our mother daughter dinner & a movie date :)\nWe always start with the AVOCADO EGG ROLLS (SO YUMMY!) then we pick something off the menu that we've never had before. My kiddo & I both love trying a new dish & the menu here is so big that we won't be running out of options any time soon. \n\nThis time around she had the JAMBALAYA. It was spicy & delicious and VERY filling! \nI got the HAWAIIAN MAHI-MAHI. It was in the 'good for you' section, so I can't really hold it against them that it was a bit on the bland side. I ate every bite & was still not full,, I'm a piggie, I know, lol. But this was good, because that meant we had room for dessert! For dessert we had the STRAWBERRY BEIGNET to share. Our waitress described it as 'heaven on a plate' & that woman was not kidding! I've had beignets before, but unlike the traditional ones, this one was baked, then covered in powdered sugar and cinnamon (have I mentioned I'm crazy for cinnamon?), topped with vanilla bean ice cream, strawberries & whipped cream. Needless to say, that plate was cleaned :) It was our favorite part of dinner!"
1,"I don't remember who I went with.\nI don't remember why I was even there.\nI don't remember what wine I had with my meal.\nI don't remember what appetizers we got.....\n\nAll I remember are two things from that dinner.\n\n1.  Sky was very blue in the Venetian.\n2.  Veal chop @Zeffirino was probably one of the most finest entree I've ever had!!!\n\nI couldn't really make out what was the exact content of the sauce on the veal chop, but it was fruit based.  Marriage between this incredible sauce and cooked to perfection quality veal was beyond belief.  I would really like to try other dishes at this restaurant, but since I don't get to go to Vegas often and cuz of this veal chop, I don't think I will get to taste anything else this crazy-noisy-fancy restaurant in the Venetian has to offer."
1,"I've been in the automotive business for over 22 years in motorsports, marketing, film, product launches and automotive training. I've seen every type of detailing service and Pit Stop Auto Detailing tops them all. Easily the best that I have seen. To round out their superior product is a serious sense of service, camaraderie, attention to detail, professionalism, product knowledge and youthful exuberance. This place is incredible."
1,"I took advantage of the travelzoo offer and only paid a little over $230 for 3 nights.  The yelp reviews pretty much cover everything about the hotel.  The buffet, service, housekeeping, rooms, etc. were great.  \n\nThe casino is not big nor small.  There is $5 blackjack and roulette at certain days and times.  There were a few areas in the casino where it was still under construction.  I can tell there were problems with the atm/cash redemption machine because I encountered one of them where it did not spit out enough money.  The supervisor was running from one atm/cash redemption machine to another to fix the situations.\n\nAs for the restaurants, I did try the Red Cup Cafe and the Studio B buffet.  The buffet exceeded my expectations and I think is one of the best.  Take advantage of the player's card as it gives you a few dollars off the buffet.  I ate at the Red Cup Cafe to satisfy my late 2am appetite.  I expected a mediocre taste in the meal from Red Cup Cafe, but was slightly above that.  \n\nExpect high winds in this area, which can make it uncomfortable to lay poolside.  I did have a neighbor next to me, but couldn't hear them.  Although, I could hear people talk in the hallways and hear doors slam, which can be very disturbing."
0,"We arrived here on a Saturday night after making a reservation and still had to wait 1/2 hour for our table. When we finally did sit, there were empty tables everywhere. \n\nThe waitress introduced herself and then left for 10 minutes without taking a drink order. I ordered a hot and sour soup with the lobster entree. The soup was great, but the lobster was just ok. Definitely not worth $40.\n\nThey forgot a few of our orders and took literally 15 minutes to run the credit card. I definitely won't be returning"
0,"Just ate  here and I or we(family) will never come back. We wanted to try the place for the first time because it's close to our house. We were greeted as cheap people \""do you have coupons today?\"" At the door...What helllllll??  Garlic chicken was horrible, even my kids couldn't eat it.  Fish taco was mystery meat??? Rolls are ok.  Pork belly is all fat!  We had to go to Chicago brewing to finish our dinner... But then again don't take my word for it, try this shit place out and see for yourself..."
0,"Bought a tape duplicator (Telex ACC 4000) on eBay and the tapes were coming out a bit \""worbly.\"" I took it in, put down a deposit, and they said I'd hear from them in a couple days. I didn't hear from them, so I just decided to go in, as I live close by. Firstly, the audio technician decided to tell me that the quality of the tapes I would make with the unit would be sub par. I know many tape labels that use this same unit, and told him so. Then he told me that the parts I needed may not be able to be found. I went into panic mode, as I desperately needed to get this in working order, and asked what kind of parts he was looking for. In an attempt to shrug me off, he was vague, and claimed I probably wouldn't be able to find them. \n\nI did.\n\nI called back and informed him of this, but said that if he could find the parts domestically (as what I found was in the UK), to let me know. I wait the weekend and call back to inquire, but as the phone is handed from the girl working the desk and the owner, I hear him say, \""Can we just give this back to him?\"" I was shocked at this kind of attitude towards a customer that was nothing but perhaps a little too persistant. After an unpleasant exchange, including a crack about my mental stability, I decided to pick it up.\n\nThe story gets crazier here.\n\nWhen I go in, I'm in a VERY poor mood. I ask for the tape duplicator, and ask why this was such and issue and why I had been  treated so poorly. I had been thinking it, but I decided to call him out on his incompetence. The unit did not include a plastic bag I had given it to them with, so I demanded one. This resulted in the man giving me a very threatening motion and insulting me. I repeated my demand, got the bag, exchanged insults, and left.\n\nThen I realize he didn't give me the power cable for the unit.\n\nI called back and demanded it, but his reply was to say that I forgot it, and that he wouldn't return it. I threatened police involvement, but was told that he had already contacted the police to file a harassment suit.\n\nI almost went in the store to confront them, but decided to be proactive and call the cops myself.\n\nNeedless to say, I got my power cable back. In exchange, they banned me from their store.\n\nI think I came out on top."
1,"New promotions, Tuesday,  $4.00 before 6pm, use your B-Connected card, Wednesday is seniors day, and they have Military and student discounts as well. \n\nPopcorn is your regular movie house but they also offer kettle corn if you like it sweet. At this time they are offering a large drink cup, $7 you pay once and if you bring it upon return, it's $3.50 for the entire year. Now we just have to remember the darn thing!\n\nSeats are roomy if you put the arm rests up and first showing, no one there!"
0,"Just to entertain myself I stopped in this Ross to compare it to my favorite Ross location (Sunnyslope/Dunlap store) Just as I expected it was total bootleg up in this location. Man the place was jacked! It's larger and you find a few more or different items as a result. The prices are the same as the other location on items that both have stocked. But this place looked like it had been hit by a plane. Broken stuff, stuff on the floor, stuff falling off hangers, stuff in the wrong departments and wrong shelves. Tables in complete disarray! Bedding and pillows on the floor. Lines...OMG! What long lines! \nThe couple of items that interest me that I spotted I passed on rather than wait in these long lines. No staff on the floor offering help. One poor staff person was putting out artwork and avoiding all contact with customers. Can't say I blame her because the customers were shouting for and at their unruly children and crying babies at decibels uncalled for. I think this clerk just wanted to disappear. So when I saw items of interest without a price I just respected her by not asking for help and leaving the items where I found them. \nThe odd thing is 3 hours before I had just shopped my favorite location where all was calm, organized and with short quick moving lines! So glad there are other locations of Ross stores near by offering the same great deals."
0,"All hype and no substance. Our reservation was secured by the concierge at the Four Seasons and we were assured that GR Steak was 'the hot restaurant'. Upon arrival, our party of 4 was ushered to the bar area for what was supposed to be a 10 minute wait. 45 minutes later, our table was ready. Needless to say, we were ready to eat. Only a waiter never materialized. Odd, considering all the staff floating about. Another 10 minutes without any staff interaction and we were on to plan 'b'. Thank you Four Seasons and Mesa Grill for saving the evening!"
1,"This place is fantastic! Everything I have had is simply delicious and I literally wake up some mornings craving their clams, black cod, Sun roll and salmon! The GF BF and I really can't get enough Yasu that just writing this makes me want to go there for dinner tonight!\n\nDon't forget to try the whole list I already mentioned plus the eggplant (either way it is prepared), live scallop if they have it, the jidori skewers, kumomoto oysters and the black snapper! \n\nSeriously amazing!"
0,We ordered the family platter for appetizer and an XL cheese. The pizza tasted like bagel bites. The sauce had a pork after taste. It was pretty obvious that everything on the family platter was frozen but the onion rings were good. The service was nice and fast.
1,"Do you like beer? I mean not in the casual, crack open a bottle on a hot day way. I mean do you really like beer? Because VBGB has is an they will sell it to you in a mug as big as your head (if you want).\n\nI must applaud that they do their best both to cover the spectrum of beer types, having at least a few wheats, ales, lagers and darks on tap at all times, but also to represent the local breweries. The house brew is by Four Friends and along with a few other FF offerings they have OMB, and Red Oak on the regular. Prices average around 5-7 for a Mittel which I imagine is a pint but feels so much more gratifying in a hearty glass mug. Most of their beers come in both a smaller and larger serving as well, with the exception of some of the high gravity business.\n\nThe food is surprisingly good. Sure, its pretty standard bar fare (burgers, chicken wings, onion rings and the like) but its not phoned in. They use Dinosaur BBQ sauce which is near and dear to my heart and taste buds, but the clear winner is the soft pretzel with cheese. So freakin' delicious. I want to be eating one right now.\n\nYou can't talk about VBGB without mentioning the patio.  They claim it's the biggest in CLT and if it isn't it's sure close.  There are plenty a picnic table & umbrella to sit under while you sip or sup and if you like a little sport with your brew they have cornhole boards and ladderball sets. You can even bring your furry friend. Add to that windows in to the bar so you don't have to go back in to refuel and you have to say they really know how to play the patio game.\n\nI like VBGB. I like it a lot, plain and simple and I'm fairly sure they have guaranteed that no one is going to spend their whole paycheck on 3 beers at a show again."
0,"If you wanna be sold a bogus plan, come to this location.  My Mom and I had a perfectly good plan so I went in to buy one of those portable Wifi devices to use strictly for my laptop and iPhone.  Dude sees our current plan--unlimited text, data, talk, you know a PERFECTLY good plan.  I simply just wanted to buy my portable device and go along my way.  So homeboy pretty much sells me on a deal by looking at my current plan which has me, my mom and grandma.  Between my mom and I, we supposedly only used 3 gigs of data a month because we have smart phones. I'm not a tech person, I don't care about gigs or whatever so I'm like oh ok that's good right? Apparently it was and he tells me he can switch my plan for us to have 10 gigs all together a month because our bill would be cheaper and this is now including my wifi device. So I'm like ok, cool.  Get the approval from my mom since she's the primary and we good to go.  3 or 4 days later I look on the device and see we've already used 4 gigs of data.  Didn't he tell me between the two of us we only use 3 a month? At this point I'm pissed! After about a week or so, we go over our gigs but best believe we don't pay for any overages because we were lied too.  Then on top of that we were charged an activation fee and deactivation fee that he NEVER mentioned but luckily the company waived all the fees because we were duped.  On top of that, the sales guy tried to holla but totally got denied.  How unprofessional can someone be.  You sell me a  BS plan and hit on me about a week later on Facebook. You'll never see me at this location again.  I might just get a verizon device because at least I know what to expect now!\n\nOh and by the way, they don't close at 9:00pm, it's 7:00pm.  I was going in there for a replacement charger but nope! Closed!  I had to go to the ratchet Wal Mart and buy one for twice as much!"
1,"The Skinny: innovative flavors and options --- panini ice cream sandwiches anyone? I need to come back (5) Service: friendly and helpful - more than willing to provide you with samples (5) Value: steak and eggs with pepper sauce.... what???? 'Nuff said. (5)\n\nWe came in because it was my birthday and the goal was to have at least 3 desserts today. I had just finished a fondant (ie, molten cake) at db Brasserie so I was ready for round 2.\n\nTucked within the same plaza as Viva Las Arepas, we stopped by to scope things out. The chef and owner greeted us and introduced her products. I think we sampled nearly all her offerings. Of interest was the strawberry/balsamic vinegar, basil (nice and minty), coconut and the chocolate mint. We ended up with the strawberry/balsamic , the coconut and the chocolate mint.\n\nThe strawberry/balsamic was more of a sorbetto than gelato. Light and refreshing, you could tell the quality of the ingredients from just one taste. The coconut gelato had a nice texture to it while the chocolate mint really satisfied my cravings (I love chocolate and mint!).\n\nWhat was more astounding was the display case filled with all the concoctions she's experimented with. Steak and eggs with pepper sauce? Chocolate and peperoncini? Pear gorgonzola? Say whaaaa? \n\nOkay, so the scoop is that she puts out the savoury/unique flavors out on Friday/Saturdays.\n\nOn top of that is her panini pressed gelato sandwiches. These sandwiches have specific combinations because apparently the gelato has to be held at a colder temperature to make a successful sandwich. I forgot to ask her if it was like a brioche con gelato... I had heard rumors about this Sicilian treat but I've never had a chance to try it. Will perform further investigation on this matter the next visit.\n\nOverall, I really enjoyed the treats here. $6 will get you a sizable portion with three different flavors and enough to share...if you are willing! Given the quality of the ingredients and the innovative flavors, this place scores a five in my book. 5-starred review."
0,"I really wish there was a 0 star option. \n\nI work next door in the building on the second floor and when I first started I would go to this place every so often. For the past couple of months I've started to hate it so much more with every visit. The staff is so rude and I've noticed a new girl there with dark hair makes me want to rip my hair because of how mean she is for no reason. I generally order the same items every visit: Thintastic Club with a side potato salad. Well, the past couple times I've been here they always get something wrong. This item usually comes with a thin wheat bagel but the last I came here they gave me a plain white thin one and it tasted like Wonder bread. On top of that, they hardly put anyyy veggie shmear that I ordered so it was sooo dry. They also used to give nice pieces of bacon but this last time they gave me bacon bits and a little bit at that. I was so furious. I would've asked them to fix my order but I know that wouldn't help because I've done it before and they got it wrong again. I will never return to this location and do not recommend anyone to come here."
0,"Ordered online and waited the 50 minutes of the 40-50 minutes that the email said before I called. I was told my pizza was on its way and should be there in 10-15 minutes. 20 minutes later I called again to find out my pizza went out for delivery an hour earlier, had to be remade and should be to my house within 10 minutes. 15 minutes later I called to cancel the order as my doorbell rang. The freezing cold pizza that was delivered to me was sent back. I recommend you skip the pain and go to Little Caesars, I did."
0,"My friend and I went there for lunch one day. It was fairly busy, we were about 4th in line with 2 cashiers working. I stepped up to the cashier when it was my turn, and was then completely ignored for the next 3 or 4 minutes. When I say ignored, I mean it. The cashier did not even look at me or acknowledge me in any way, shape, or form. She proceeded to do something with the register for that  entire time. So I finally gave up and moved over to the other line. The food was good but for the  lackluster service, it wasn't great enough to make me ever go back."
0,"Not real Spanish food. Truly overpriced. Overcooked shrimp (gasp!).\n\nRossejat sucked; they only give you one dried up quail; only memorable thing here is that they serve one particular dish in a hiking boot. \n\nTruffle sandwich thing okay, but then again truffles are always okay.\n\nGo elsewhere."
0,"I used to live right up the street from this restaurant and as a result came here several times.  I don't think that there is any way I'd return though.  I have literally never felt good after eating here - whether it was a hazy, late night encounter and getting sick in the morning, or more of a standard evening dinner and getting sick at night.  Maybe I'm allergic to some sort of special, exclusive ingredient they use..."
0,"Celiacs beware!! Today was our third visit. The first time was great, second time we ordered the same as the first time and to our disappointment it was nothing like the first time. Then, today, it was actually good, so this tells me of their inconsistency, however, that's not why I'm writing this review.  I am CELIAC (MUST have a Gluten Free diet) and for any of you aware of what that is, the MUST is non negotiable, apparently Crispy Crepe is ignorant of this and SHOULDN'T offer \""gluten-free if they are not going to adhere to the claim or understand the effects of cross-contamination, etc. After such a lovely lunch with my family, I am now dealing with the ill effects of gluten contamination. Shame.."
0,"Slow. ... slow. .... so slow.  Even when no one else is here. 40 min and counting, I won't be returning I value my time."
1,"The food is excellent  , great special occasion restaurants .. southwest flair not the typical Mexican food . Excellent choices of Tequila  - and cocktails.."
1,"I love learning stores for educational toys/games/art supplies for the kids and this one does not disappoint. They have a large selection and the staff is friendly. Some items may be considered overpriced, like another yelper suggested they could just go to Wal-Mart for their pens, but that's expected. \n\nI, myself, am not a teacher but was shopping with a girlfriend who is. She shared the same sentiments about there not being much for a teacher who teaches outside of Elementary. Nonetheless, it's worth checking out. I also believe they offer a teacher's discount."
1,"I have been going here since I was a kid, best donuts ever! Crumb donut is amazing, but all of their donuts are good, they have donut holes, thai tea and coffee drinks. The same people have been working here for as long as I can remember."
1,"First of all, this location is awesome. Went in here to pick up a jacket and Caleb (I think that was his name) was really helpful. I've been meaning to get a membership every time i come here but never have until now. When asked if I had a membership I was told about all the benefits and sales and decided to sign up, thankfully the membership paid for itself after my first purchase. A little more expensive than other similar stores but much better customer service!"
1,"Juan Taco catered my friends bday party! The taco truck just pulled up in their driveway! It was a great idea! The owners were so nice and the food was good! I asked for chicken tacos with no tortillas. She made it right up with no issues! Great idea for any party! She also said they weren't uptown anymore bc they got a diff gig. Tear, no more Trade and Tryon!"
1,"Been using them for years, they have the best value I have found for onsite service.  I have used other mobile services in the past and have been charged way more than what ABC charges.  I have also been to their store quite a few times and it is nothing fancy but they have lots of locks and even used safes you can buy onsite.  They even work on cars, trucks, and any type of lock or safe at their location on 7th Avenue."
1,"There is only one place I would want a person to sell like a car salesman, and thats here at Ferraro's!  The waiter who was assigned to our party was just like Alfred from Batman!  He was at our beck and call.  He was attentive to our needs, very knowledgeable of the Italian food lingo and he wheeled n' dealed us on the most prestigious dishes on the menu.  Not to mention his team of bus persons who hawked us for any breadcrumbs to be immediately scraped off the table.  \nHonest to say, I've been tired of the Italian food fare.  If it wasn't for a deal breaker I found on Restaraunts.com, I would have never considered dining at this stallion of a venue.  Needless to say, The menu items were more on the Bucket O' Gold side, but because of the quality and taste of the food, it was money well spent.  We ordered a number of items on the menu, but the one most memorable dish, out of all things, was the calamari!  The squid was fresh and fried to perfection!  If ya gotta PYT, take her here to start things off.. the ambiance is very dramatic.  If you're coming with a sizeable party, I suggest you order numerous items and have the chef portion the food to the number of people in your party.  The waiter will bring it in individual plates so that everyone gets a taste of  the Fanciness!  ..Fancy!"
1,"The place is wonderful. The workers have a nice additude and always care. The auditoriums are big and the seats are extremely comfortable. A little more expensive then regular theatres, but WAY worth it."
0,"They forgot my fries...\n\nC'mon guys, a combo meal is...say it with me...\n\nA burger + a drink + FRIES\n\nAnd yet they forgot the stinking fries.  Kid's screaming, can't turn the car around and get back in line..."
1,"I've been going to Golden Eggroll for 18 years now and I've got to say.  I love the Kung Pao Chicken.  Still taste as good as it was then when I first went there.  Another favorite of mine is the Hot and Sour Soup, always cure a bad cold.  I recently introduce my neighbor to the place and he can't stop talking about the Orange Chicken and Shrimp Fried Rice.  Now its on my to try list."
0,I always forget why I don't come here and then I remember. It's mediocre at best.
1,"Atmosphere is great, good music and really awesome decor. I had the VW Squeeze - egg, avocado, sliced turkey and havarti cheese piled on a delicious pretzel bun, a side of fresh fruit and a choice of potato. The hash browns were underwhelming. My boyfriend got the breakfast potatoes and they were amazing. Next time I'd definitely get those. Also, the iced nectarine green tea is awesome. Straight up. :) I have to agree with some of the comments about the coffee being super bitter. Dad in law's girlfriend put seven sugars in it and the whole bit of cream and said she couldn't even taste the cream or sugar. Yikes!!\nTotal bill for four people was $37 (before tip-Dad in Law and his girlfriend eat like birds) so not too bad! The little bar/patio was nice, a little chilly after they turned off the warmers, but there were a bunch of two-seaters and four-seaters so there was room. We went at a great time, though. As we were leaving there was a line waiting out the door. Good thing the weather was great :)"
1,"I love the grilled pork here.  Whether it is on my bahn mi or the bun, it rocks!  It is juicy and flavorful without being too fatty.  They cut it just right so it isn't too chewy or too thin.  \n\nThe problem is that they mess up our orders, a lot.  Sometimes they are up front about it and tell us they don't have the grilled pork.  Sometimes it isn't until we open up the food (we usually but it to go) that we find out they have substituted chinese BBQ pork or something else entirely.\n\nThe pho is good, we normally get the pho tai or the pho tai chin gan, usually it has just the right amount of fat.  Occassionally it has been too fatty where it congeals on top (sometimes the A/C is on too high in the restaurant!).  \n\nThe servers are friendly, though often inattentive.  \n\nStill it is my favorite place that serves all three things we tend to want (pho, bun, and bahn mi).  There are places that make better bahn mi, pho or bun but they don't serve all three and make them as well as Pho Kinh Do does."
0,It was okay don't like the high prices and I didn't even get a lobster bucket. The people were really nice I just didn't like the manger. Also the alcohols drinks are not that good it's more fruits juice then alcohol. I rather go to boiling crab any day . Sorry
0,"Really? This restaurant bears the name of Gordon Ramsey? Actually, more closely resembles Amy's Baking Kitchen. How can he have any credibility judging and criticizing the food of others when his establishment serves such horrible food?\n\nNow I wanna say that the service was excellent and the staff very warm. Drinks were large as they should be for the price. Apps were okay. Onion soup was awesome and vegetable salad solid. But the entrees were absolutely horrible. I had the pork belly and could only get through a  bite. It was too fatty and oily, without flavor! \n\nI'm shocked that for the money and considering all the great good alternatives, how can this place stay in business? Should have just gone to Nobu and spent $50 more!"
0,"My wife and I stayed at the Phoenician for the first time this past weekend for our anniversary.  I had heard many good things about the hotel so I expected the same to be true for the golf course.  I found the golf course decidedly average.  The conditions were actually slightly below average.  With so many great courses in Phoenix, I would recommend skipping this one as its nothing special.  On top of that, the 19th hole alcohol was absurdly priced.  They did have a tremendous beer selection however if that interests you."
1,"My wife and I really dig this place. We have frequented the Chandler location and were very happy to see one in our area sprout up. We have never had a bad experience. The meal price is very reasonable for a sushi place. Here is the secret trick, don't wait for the conveyor belt to come around. If you want something ask for it, if its on the belt they will grab it. If not, they will make anything on the menu and bring it right to you. The scallops and hard poppers are awesome!"
1,"Sheer perfection. Scallops with oxtail, pork loin, Wagyu beef tartare (never thought I'd try), 48-hour beef belly, and dessert that includes olive oil! My wife and I were having one unforgettable culinary experience after another. Las Vegas has LOTS of top-notch restaurants so we always want to try new ones. However, next time, we WILL be coming back to Sage! Besides, we loved the hotel itself as well!"
0,"My hubby and I tried this place again a few weeks ago and the service was amazing. We went again tonight and what a difference night and day makes. The service was just awful.  40 minutes for our food because they were waiting on one item, but could not give us an update as to why until the food actually arrived. Neither of us got a refill on our drinks even though they sat empty for most of the meal. No up sale for dessert and there were long periods of wait time between everything. Meanwhile the other server was working the room like Cinderella, she even showed off her daughter who was with other family members who were chowing down. (It was pretty close to closing at the time.) Our server was just plain phoning it in. I do not recommend going to eat here at night."
1,"I love the look & feel of this place. It reminds me of Downtown Disney. A great place to take a stroll and people watch.  A nice mix of shops, restaurants and bars. My favorite is the Polaroid Fotobar.  Looking foward to see what else opens up =)"
1,"Just like Sonic I miss this place so much. I have not found a place that can come even close in Boston to the unreal Mexican food \""Betos\"" had 24/7. Nothing beat hitting up Betos after a night of drinking or even hitting it up at 7am for a breakfast burrito. You cannot beat their prices, the breakfast burritos are less than 2 bucks and their bigger and as heavy as a brick. Betos will you and Sonic please move franchises to Boston."
1,"This place is awesome!\n\nMy roommate, her niece and I came here a few days ago after shopping at Scottsdale Fashion Square. \n\nThe ambiance is really cool with funky light fixtures and chairs. \n\nOur service was top notch (Thanks Kyle!) - our waters were never empty and he was very informative about the menu.\n\nWe had the rings, totz and sweet pots plus the 5 various aiolis. My favorite was the spicy aiolis since the main ingredient was sriracha!\n\nFor the main course we had: the buffalo burger, turkey burger, and the chicken burger.\n\nI love that they come in slider sizes because it gives you a variety of choices to pick and choose from so you're not committed to just one burger. \n\nI will definitely be back for more and to get my drink on!\n\nFor a good laugh and pictures, visit my blog at: \nhttp://www.adventuresofahungrylatina.com/2011/07/dont-judge-burger-by-its-size.html"
1,"This is one of my favorite used book stores in Charlotte.  The staff is always super helpful, prices are great, and the selection is wonderful.  I have bought everything from Tom Clancy books to a cookbook by Gordon Ramsay, and everything in between.  Recently, they also offered a groupon, $40 worth of material for $20.  If you are looking for a great deal, stop in."
0,"Due to a friends recommendation I decided to go back and try jasons deli again. Unfortunately, after I took first bite of my wraps the one with hummus my stomach started bubbling. I thought maybe it was just  because I was hungry. Unfortunately, after I ate my wrap (smothered in olives) eww!  I realized I had food poisoning. I haven't ever been so sick from food before in my life. I don't know what could have caused this but take precaution before eating there. :'("
1,"Tr\u00e8s bon restaurant en plein coeur de Centropolis. \n\nC'est parfait pour partager un repas \u00e0 plusieurs. Tel un restaurant libanais, vous aurez droit \u00e0 diff\u00e9rentes pur\u00e9es que vous pourrez d\u00e9guster avec un pita. Nous avions un plateau pour 2 et c'\u00e9tait suffisant pour 2, si ce n'\u00e9tait m\u00eame pas trop.

1,"the most fun i've had at a buffet ever! maybe cuz of the champagne brunch which means unlimited mimosas. \n\nthe wait was a bit long, but i think worth it. it was 27.99 for the champagne brunch. there were eggs, bacon, toast, pancakes, duck, prime rib, roast beef, sausages....the sushi was lame. really good seafood soup!!! and we added mussels in it. OMG soooo delicious. the shrimp and crab legs tasted fresh. their creme brulee wass tastyyy. they had a lot of good things, and fruits and ice cream. of course we had to drink our money worth of mimosas so of course we got a little giddy. but definitely fun! we were all extremely full and satisfied."
1,"We snacked at the bar and had a few drinks for happy hour. It was amazing and a great deal. I recommend the stuffed dates and the steak frites. The bartender was helpful and friendly. I would have never known about this gem if it were not for a random happy hour search, and now I definitely plan on returning and trying their full menu."
0,Food was great but the service was awful. We never even got refills on our drinks when we asked numerous times. Burger was the best part of the experience.
0,"I think you gotta love the \""Stillers\"" or be a Pitt fan to understand why anyone would think this place is terrific.  Sorry guys, I don't necessarily get it.   This is certainly not the most horrible stadium I have ever visited, but it sure isn't up to snuff with many of the other stadiums about the country.  Went to a Univeristy of Pitt football game over the weekend.  Since I am from out of town, I was not familiar with the layout or where to enter in terms of where my seats were located.  Got some pretty bad directions from the staff working outside of the stadium and needless to say, I spent almost the entire first quarter of the game attempting to find our seats.  \n\nI will say that once seated, the view is good and nothing that I could see would impart your vision of the field from wherever you are sitting.  Food offerings are your standard fare (hot dogs, soda, hamburgers, nachos, etc,) - nothing out of the ordinary.  \n\nThe main concourse on the street level is pretty nice, and gives you a nice sense of the history of the \""Stillers\"" and is really a walk down memory lane, even for those of us who don't live in Pittsburgh but remember the teams from the 70's and their glory days.  (Yes, admittedly, they are still a pretty terrific team!).\n\nLoved the Heintz bottles on the fan-o-vision that tip over and look like ketsup running down the screen - very cool!"
1,"Amazing food!!!!!! One of the best meals I've had in a long time!!! Super cool and chill environment, we will definitely be back!"
1,"I like to visit on my lunch break, its a healthier option than fast food and its super fast service with Delish sushi!"
0,It's been years since I've been to Tropical Smoothie. The smoothie (Paradise Point Smoothie) was awesome! I ordered Chicken Pesto Flatbread and I wasn't impressed. The bread was extremely dry and the chicken was very bland. I didn't finish my meal. I don't see myself going back to Tropical Smoothie.
1,"Staff is hysterical, entertaining, knowledgeable and kind. Michael and Jackie are the best! So impressed. Be prepared to laugh, great chemistry!"
1,Have been getting my nails done for years. Just came back to this place a few months ago and boy am I glad I did. Tina is great and quick. Used to take 2 hours to have my nails done. I have heard the other nail techs do a great job also. I won't change places again.
1,"They make awesome subs for a good price.\n\nI enjoy these a lot more than Subway (bland.) Also, they make the sandwiches very fast. I've been in and out of the store within two minutes before. \n\nI always get the J.J. Gargantuan sub and it is the one with all the meat on it. Very good."
1,"Banh Mi - Vietnamese sub sandwiches, via French baguette (yum!)\n\nPlace - small, tight, only two tables for seating area. If you need a place to sit and eat your sandwiches, you can sit on the bench, outside the shop by the non operable water, by the fountain. \n\nFood - the banh mi #11 is good (steam pork meat). This time, I got #12 which is the same as #11, but longer, almost a foot. I normally don't like p\u00e2t\u00e9, but with my Vietnamese sandwich, I had to have with it.  It just enhances the flavor of the sandwich, with their beurre (lard) --yummm!! They do a good job with the sandwiches here, it brings me close to home in Houston. \n\nService - they can be quick as can be. The only gripe I have is that they do not take sugar cane orders, 30 minutes before closing!  I thought they close at 6:30pm, but the hours now is that they close at 6:00pm daily. Cash only, no exceptions -- had to go to an ATM."
0,"Well I grew up in Tempe and always went to the vine! For starters, they have horrible customer service. You will rarely leave there feeling like the servers, hostess, or bartender went out of their way to make your experience better. You'll notice that the employees are all very fairly young... maybe this has something to do with the poor customer service? They take short cuts all the time! Especially when they are busy. Be careful on your To-go orders! If you get wings they will most likely be dished out to you cold. This has happened to me a few times when I dined in as well. \n\nThe Vine just has a 'whatever' feel to me. Honestly It's like going to Applebees but with worst service and less selection. \n\nPros: Decent bar food, normal service times, lots of TV's for sports viewing\n\nCons: Bad service, Rude staff, the kitchen let's cold food go out, cutting corners, horrible salads"
0,"I was in Vegas and needed a hair cut.  My hair cut is simple.  Same one Ive had for about 13 yrs.  #1 blended up fade.  Even on top.  SIMPLE!  About 30 different Asian ladies over the years some that dont speak great English can figure this one out. \n\nWhile waiting I noticed the stylist did not stop talking (Thats overrated to me, and kept on talking about working out and fitness)  \n\nI'm up.\n\n I tell her what I want.  Shes SEEMS to understand.   Right away she buzzes me all the way up with a number one.  Thats NOT BLENDED.  I try to slow her down VERY politely and she says \""You know how long have you been asking for this hairstyle...you know what you want...Let me do what I do.)  Then she proceeds to tell me a story about a guy that left in the middle of the haircut because he kept asking her questions.  Well apparently he was not CRAZY for that.  \n\nShe ends up stepping my hair which is the opposite of what I want.  She asks me where I'm from.  I live in San Leandro which is neighboring Oakland.  I just tell her by Oakland since we are in Vegas. She counters with Wow I did not know White people lived there.  I wanted to counter so many witty things that she would not have appreciated but I did not since she had clippers by my hair  (Side note...The two people you dont mess with...Barbers and Waiters).  \n\nI had not shaven for a few days and she asks me what should I do with the sideburns.  I said leave them I like to take care of them.  Then she clips them WAY high and said oh well I'm gonna do them because you guys never get them straight anyway.  IRONY is SHE MADE THEM SHORT AND SLANTED!\n\nThen she asks if I put product in my hair.  Not often and I would rather not as I was going to run after this and shower.  She goes well its what I do and puts the equivalent of a quart of Pennzoil on my jacked up head and gives me the ultimate DB fohawk.  I almost kicked my own A**.\n\nShe then proceeded to tell me about her \""shoulder workout\"".  She also decided to educate me about fitness.  (Side note....Not to be mean but she is not a certified trainer by any means or equipped to drop this knowledge)  Double side note....I am...I'm a fit PE TEACHER!!!!!!).....But I just let her talk and I tried to be thankful I was almost done.  \n\nI hate that this is my first Yelp review and plan to do 4 positives to even out this one but three weeks later I just looked at my hair and its growing out even worse.  Sorry miss Supercuts lady . Maybe it was just a bad day for ya but we did not click.  I also still tipped her 10 bucks but would not return."
0,"Review is for the frozen bar.\n\nOverpriced, even for Vegas. Not nearly as good as Fat Tuesday or Lime Ice."
1,Love this place! People that work there are awesome and always remember us & what we like. Who doesn't want to go to a place like that.
1,"I have lived in Montreal for several years and every time I come back to the city I do not miss the chance to go to 3 Brasseurs. I prefer this location (St. Catherine/McGill College) but have been to all of them (St. Denis one, Old Port, Crescent, Laval etc). I do not think there has been a single time in the maybe 20-30 visits minimum that I was ever disappointed. No joke. \n\nBeer is always excellent and they make their own. Any of them would do. My gf loves the beer cocktails they make she always has a few when we go. As for the food, I always love getting the Flammkueche (flatbread pizzas) which are incredible. Has other things as well, such as the chicken skewers, burgers or pork - and again never was disappointed. One thing that they could improve on is their poutine - not the top I've had in Quebec...\n\nAll in all - everytime I go to Montreal I must have some 3 Brasseurs - and everytime I leave a happy camper!"
1,"If you're a half-decent looking girl who likes going \""WOOOO' while dancing in your seat whenever you hear a song you like .... or if you're a guy who's attracted to those kinda girls... you'll LOVE this place.\n\nAs for the food.  Had the $180 Wagyu rib-eye and the girl had the $195 Wagyu NY Strip.  It was aight.  Their french fries are pretty delish though.\n\nThumbs up for me."
1,"Raising Cane's is awesome. I always order the Big Box, The Fingers are made fresh and come out HOT. So its best to let them cool off for a bit. The French Fries are good, offering Onion RIngs wouldnt be a bad thing. The Staff are always friendly and checking to make sure everything is ok. Something about the sauce. I prefer the Sweet Tea. You wont be disappointed."
0,"Meh....\n\nWhat Over Easy has going for it is that it's breakfast options are HUGE.  This was a good place for us to try because our brunch crew has someone who doesn't eat eggs at breakfast.  We need other options (otherwise it's always bread/carbs for her).  So it was on the table.\n\nWe went at 10:30 on a Saturday morning.  For a group of 4, no wait.  First impression good.  As we continue to sit, we grow uncomfortable with the fact that it's still morning and we're listening to heavy metal.  It's just not breakfast music to us.  Order drinks.  Drinks take a bit.  When they do arrive, one of the iced coffees is dripping and the waiter drips it all down my husband's arm.  I had attempted to draw the dripping glass to his attention before the drink/sleeve interaction but alas, iced coffee on the arm.  And no apology, just a bunch of napkins tossed onto the table.  Now there's some crabbiness.\n\nWe order our food.  We do a little table rearrangements because of the tv distraction for some.  I had the wolfpack which was decent.  Nothing amazing.  My eggs were a little on the hard side, not how I prefer them.  Husband had the hopple popple and wasn't enthused.  BIL had breakfast burrito and was pleased but didn't like the single pancake (quote: tastes like bisquick).  BIL's girlfriend had carmelized banana french toast and sourdough toast.  The french toast was rich and the sourdough burnt.\n\nIced coffee tasted extremely watered down.  I prefer the toddy at gallo blanco or what I make at home.  Hot coffee did not impress.  We probably won't be back."
0,Horrible preschool. Teachers are lazy and the kids do not learn much. We pulled our son out this year.  We realize now why they lost so many kids last year. School has bad leadership and fired teachers because of low enrollment.
1,Authentic fresh delicious. Don't waste your time at other places this is it. This is must try it will become one of your favorites.
0,"I'm having a hard time coming up with anything good to say about this faux Mexican-food joint. \n\nThe meat is shredded and then cooked so much that it turns dry, chewy, and clumped together. It was virtually inedible and I had a very difficult time managing to get three of my eight taco's down. Wait, these should not be called tacos. Tacos do NOT feature deep fried shells, hand-fulls of cheese, half-a-head of lettuce, and meat products resembling dog droppings. Needless to say, I didn't finish my food.\n\nIt has \""Taco\"" in the name but what they make are not tacos, rather something resembling food i would only reserve for my worst enemy. \n\nYou couldn't pay me to return. I can't fathom how this place is part of a chain. Then again it's open late and probably gets most of its business from the drunk crowd. Steer clear if you're looking for a descent meal."
0,"Went in here last night. The selection was great, and people kept asking if we needed help. However, when I did, I didn't get it. I was trying to buy a bottle of cologne for my boyfriend and a pretty black girl with a spiked faux hawk asked if I needed help.  I asked her about the cologne because they were out of the size I wanted...she opened a drawer and there wasnt anymore. I asked if perhaps they had any in the back. She said maybe but did I really want her to look in the back? Um... What? \n\n\""Do you REALLY want me to look in the back room?\"" *Sigh*\n\nI said I guess not and walked away.  Its cool, I will just order it from somewhere else, and I wont be back.  Dont hurt yourself chick."
0,"The staff rushed us to make an order telling us \"" Kitchen is closing\"" - this was at 10:10 pm and the sign says that they are open till 10:30. The waiter brought out each item as it was prepared leaving several persons at the table uncomfortably  eating as others waited for their food. Several item that we ordered did not show up and  when we questioned out waiter we were told that kitchen is closed in a  VERY RUDE manner.  The food ( what we got ) was good but this was one of the worst dining experiences I have ever had...."
1,"I've been to Sedona many times, but after sitting on their fabulous patio last night - IN FEBRUARY  - I am finally compelled to write a review.  If you don't agree that this is the most relaxing, cool patio in Las Vegas, someone needs to punch you right in the mouth! \n\nSeriously, the lighting is perfect.  Sexy without being too dark.  The heat lamps are just right.  And if you get too cold there's an awesome firepit.  Best of all the patio furniture is very comfortable.  If it gets too cold, then you move inside where the atmosphere is also very cool.  This is one of the few places that I feel like I'm no longer in Las Vegas.  \n\nTo top it off, their 4-7 happy hour is fantastic.  $8 appetizers, $5 wine, $4 wells and $3 domestics.  The food is really good.  With the exception of the calamari (it's floppy not crispy), I've loved everything I've ever eaten here.  Gotta try the Ahi Tuna Lettuce Wraps.  And the oysters are very fresh!  If you are looking for a great romantic date spot, the tables by the firepit are key. This area is kind of closed off and private.  I walked in to a sexy date in progress and decided to sit in the other area of the patio because pimping ain't easy and I respect that!"
1,"Fun store! Though I just spent a couple minutes here while my husband was browsing, I loved the old fashioned vibe. Plus, the owner seemed to be very hands-on. Not only was she helping a lot of customers find particular items, but I heard a couple customers even address her by name as they entered."
0,"Didn't care for it.  Expensive, small portions, and mediocre cooking.  Go a few blocks west to Saigon Pho if you want the real thing.  But this place is prettier, whatever that's worth to you."

0,"Formerly Stars Comedy Club, Bentley's Bar & Grill is not to be confused with Bentley's on 27 in downtown Charlotte.\n\nBentley's Bar & Grill is a sports bar in downtown Belmont NC with a flair for running out of burgers or just about anything else at 9pm on Saturdays.  Yes the manager comp'ed our meal.  But our waitress was completely indifferent and service overall was terrible.  It still took half an hour to get a few beers and cokes to our table.  She refilled water once every two hours and everyone in our group was eating dinner.  \n\nBut I don't blame our waitress.  All of the problems that night were indicative of the management's inability to pay attention to the basic details of running a restaurant.  Don't make me beg for food and drink.  You're the ones that put the sign on the door that says \""Open for business\""."
1,"I love BBQ and I've wanted to try Bobby Q for a while so when the boyfriend had a friend coming to visit who was staying near here I suggested we try it out.\n\nIt's always a little scary to take someone to a place you've never been to but Bobby Q did not disappoint.\n\nWe started with their Q rolls for an appetizer. SO good. They are kinda like egg rolls but with brisket and they come with a chipotle dipping sauce that is really good. \n\nI ordered the brisket sandwich (apparently I was in a brisket kinda mood) which comes with shoestring fries and I ordered a side of mac n cheese as well. I'm not kidding when I say this is some of the best beef brisket I've ever had. It was so tender, not dry at all and it had just the right amount of sauce - enough to give you that rich BBQ flavor but not so much that the meat is swimming in it.\nThe fries were good but the mac n cheese was really good. VERY rich and creamy. I couldn't finish it all. \nThe boyfriend had chicken and mashed potatoes. He said the chicken was good but the potatoes came without gravy. Maybe they forgot it? So those were kinda dull. \nOur friend got ribs and mac n cheese. The ribs looked amazing - fall off the bone type.\n\nWe stayed at the table really late - we were literally the last people in the place but they didn't seem to care that we were just hanging out which was cool. \n\nWe didn't go to the bar next door but it was packed and looked like a fun place to grab a drink.\n\nBobby Q turned out to be a great place to bring a visitor since they let us talk forever and the food was tasty and reasonably priced. I would definitely eat there again."
0,"I was pretty stoked to check this place out, being a big Sammy Hagar fan, but I was pretty damn disappointed when it finally came to trying it out.\n\nDad and I went down for lunch, and we had a Groupon that was good for $30. We popped in around 12:30 PM, and it was already a difficulty just to find someone to seat us. There was no waitress around to seat us, so the hostess had us wait at the podium for a few minutes, and then she finally sat us herself. At this point, it was no biggie.\n\nWe sat down, and a waitress came up and took our drink order pretty quick...very friendly girl. She brought us some chips and salsa, which were pretty good.\n\nI ordered the 4-item combo plate with a Carne Asada soft taco, a Chicken soft taco, a beef enchilada, and a chicken enchilada ($19) . Dad ordered Chicken nachos ($13). Let me just say, this is HIGHLY overpriced food. \n\nThe food was brought out, and we marvelled at how little was actually on our plates. Dad's nachos consisted of eight chips with chicken and cheese centered around a scoop of guacamole. To make matters worse, they were extremely bland.\n\nMy food was more of the same disappointment. I had asked for my soft tacos with just meat and cheese only, and they were PILED with stuff. When I finally wiped everything off, the meat didn't even taste great at all. It was all extremely bland. The rice was okay, but the enchiladas were HORRIFIC. I've never tasted worse green sauce in my entire life.\n\nThroughout the meal, there was this annoying bus boy who hovered around our table. Whenever we would pause in eating, he would run up to our table and ask if he could take our plate. He did this three or four times, and every time he seemed to get cockier. Let us eat our mediocre food in peace!!\n\nAfter all was said and done, I'm glad we had a Groupon...though I wished I hadn't even spent the time eating there. Avoid!"
0,"I used to come to this place every other week. Loved it! They finally convinced me to upgrade to gel manicures. They explained the benefits and such.. sounded awesome. \n\nLet's just say the gel mani didn't live up to the hype. When I went to get the polish removed, they filed my nails down rather than soaking them. My nails have been brittle and weak for about a month. Lots of chipping, peeling and breaking.\n\nThey also claim to fix gel manis if you get any chipping within the first week. Their idea of fixing is filing the chip off.\n\nI am kind of afraid to come back here. Sad, because this was my go to spot."
1,Love the burger amazing.  Incredible tacos and atmophere.  Love love love the open air bar area.  Attentive service and the manager even checked up on us we will definitely be back.
0,I wish I could rate it higher because the girl was very nice to help me however the selection was lacking today and the wait was super long. There were zero brownie bites available and only one box of carrot bites. And two ready made boxes of cookies and only one plain bagel...I'm on the run most days and need quick fresh treats available and typically can get my needs met here.
1,"Jade Palace is a great little gem tucked away in a strip mall near Pinnacle Peak Rd. and Scottsdale Rd.\n\nI recently binged on a bunch of delicious dishes here as a pre-diet feast.  The place was packed with sliver-haired snow birds.  There was some cougar action at the bar which I always love to watch, but now that i think of it, it was more of a Hugh Hefner and his 24 year old bride-to-be action.  I was actually the only cougar there. :)\n\nI digress.  \n\n3 Delicacies is great.  Tender flank steak with tender scallops and tender shrimp.  Crab puffs were awesome and light and flaky but creamy and lovely in the middle.  Fried rice is excellent and they don't skimp on meat if you choose to order it with chicken.  And the chicken was tender.  Generous portions. Again, everything is lovely, yummy, fresh, tender, and most importantly, NOT TOO GREASY, which we all know is the signature of Chinese food. And my Absolut Press was poured in generous manner. :)\n\nIf you are looking for crappy food don't go here.  If you are looking to meet men, go here but expect them to all be over 65. If you are looking to meet younger men and have crappy food, go to Sapporo."
1,"We went to Katsuya on our stay-cation to celebrate Eric R.'s birthday.  It happened to be the 50% off locals Sunday pick.  We did not have reservations so we opted to sit at the cocktail bar.  Our bartender/server happened to recognize me from a past job in town and that made it a very personable experience.  We got there right at opening (6 PM) and ordered immediately.  I had iced green tea (apparently the SLS commissions its own tea plantation for exclusive hot and iced teas) and Eric R. had hot green tea and the Katsuya fresh cucumber cocktail.\n\nSome things we ordered we waited over an hour for, and things our neighbor at the bar got we were told the kitchen ran out of even though we ordered them at the same time (like negi toro) so that was frustrating.  We tried a variety of dishes, including the seaweed sunomono, salmon sashimi appetizer with caviar, and the wagyu beef sashimi with hot oil (Nobu's was better).  We sampled yellowtail, salmon, toro, scallop, and mackerel sushi.  The mackerel was served with thin kelp on top of it.\n\nI also tried a salmon skin handroll which had kaiware sprouts, gobo, and cucumber.  One of my favorite dishes of the night was the mushroom bop - a hot stone pot like dolsot bimibap with arborio rice, a variety of mushrooms, a hint of parmesan, and a sauce that brought it all together so deliciously.  We finished with the dessert omakase which had mochi, yuzu cheesecake, green tea creme brulee, and sorbet.  Service was great though we had a rush of food then a very long wait for the rest of the stuff.  With the half off and a few comps for the wait plus the $5 happy hour cocktails, we ended up right below our dining credit allotment so all we paid was tax and tip - sweet local deal and a great birthday present for Eric R."
0,"Shame on you, Green Owl.  As the only (?) vegetarian restaurant in Madison, you really seem to rely on that to bring people in, rather than your food.  While I enjoyed my entree (the meatloaf sandwich), my side of crispy kale (which I had to pay extra for) arrived as a charred pile of powder.  How dare you let that out of the kitchen, let alone serve it to a paying customer?  And why/how are your desserts so awful?  I generally will seek out/pay more for vegan desserts, as I find them to taste better than conventional desserts...and there are plenty of vegan bakeries out there to support this claim.  My coconut cream pie was a pile of coconut, on top of a tasteless white paste, and appeared to have been shaped into a triangle to resemble a pie slice.  Service was bad, but it appeared to be just our waitress.  I didn't know there were specials (until I overheard the other servers telling their tables), and the worst is that on the back of the dessert menu was the Friday fish fry special, which I totally would have ordered had I known about it (yes I was there on a Friday night).  \n\nMy suggestions:\n- Have 1 or 2 \""non-weird\"" options, so carnivores feel comfortable joining their vegetarian dining companions here.  Something along the lines of a \""normal\"" pasta, mexican lasagna, etc where they wouldn't miss the meat.  \n- Servers need direction.  I didn't appreciate seeing my waitress walk out of the kitchen chewing a mouthful of food while I sat at my table waiting for food.\n- The dessert menu as it stands needs to be scrapped.  If you need to bring in vegan desserts from another business, do it.  Those desserts were a fail (I tried part of another one of the desserts and was not impressed).\n\nFood took forever to come out, which I'm willing to deal with but you should put something on the menu about that (there are tasteful ways of saying that the food takes time).  The restaurant was not busy at the time."
0,"After eating here with friends on 08/04/12, I discovered that this place had a VERY LOW B-Rating from the Health Department recently. So I asked \""Why did you bring me here??\"" Their reply was that the establishment now has an A-Rating. I don't care. \n\nThe interior needs cleaning. The ceiling tiles are stained and there were buckets in the middle of the floor catching what the waitress called \""air conditioner leaks.\"" If dust or being in an extremely crowded dining room bothers you (it bothers me) that is an issue as well. This place really needs work. \n\nOne friend had the veggie Stromboli and the other had the House Calzone, which they said were good. I ordered the Chicken Salad Platter which was terrible. It consisted of chicken salad, potato salad and macaroni salad over a garden salad. It was a cold dish served on a very hot plate. The salads tasted to be not-so-fresh and were definitely out of a container from the food supplier. Fresh? No way!! I sent it back and opted for a large garden salad which was adequate. \n\nNow about the service: Two words come to mind .. slow and distracted. we constantly had to ask for drink refills and bread. The waitress said they were making the bread which was odd since it always arrived at the table cold. \n\nPeople seem to like the pizza here and it is THE ONLY Italian place around for miles and miles. I suppose their capture ratio is the biggest factor in their success. For me, the place failed on food, service and atmosphere."
0,"I dislike this specific Starbucks a lot, my drink is always made wrong. Staff Is awesome but drinks wise, not the best."
1,First time there.  It was a Sunday night so the wine was 1/2 off which made us very happy.  Food was excellent.  Had the pad thai and a shrimp and scallops dish.  \n\nMy only complaint is that it was really hot seated near the window as the sun was going down.  We didn't linger as a result.
0,"Compared to all you can eat korean bbq I had in Seattle, the food quality here doesn't even come close to it. And it's expensive ($22/person, OB beer $5.99)! I have tried other korean bbq places around vegas and other asian restaurants, the food quality is rather disappointed here."
0,"Truffle fries, gourmet burgers, hints of Asian fusion here and there, and food served on plates with four corners.  This is enough to make some people thrilled about a restaurant already.  However, when everybody else seems to be doing the the same thing, each one needs to stand out in some way.  Rusconi's didn't.\n\nTHE GIST: Modern American menu / Inconsistent seasoning / Service needs work\n\nFOOD HIGHLIGHTS\n\nGoat Cheese Fondue with Pita Bread: The fondue was good, the pita bread used to dip it was not.  Our first batch had lukewarm pita bread that had a chewy, dare-I-say microwaved consistency.  After our table finished the first round of pita bread, they were kind enough to offer a second; this batch came out burnt, but this time with a sitting-on-the-counter-too-long consistency.\n\nCheeseburger with Fries: Several members of my party ordered this one, one of them asking for no salt on the fries.  Everybody else got crunchy, but very salty fries.  Her order seemed to have a batch of unsalted fries sitting atop a batch of salted fries, because there was definitely salt at the bottom of her bowl.  The burger itself was unremarkable.\n\nOssobuco: This was the special for the night.  Unlike the fries, it was incredibly under-seasoned and rather dry.  I got it to taste a bit better with some salt, but dry ossobuco is pretty hard to get through as is.  Not recommended.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nIt's trendy, it's big, and it's American, but there are too many places pulling this concept off correctly for me to recommend this to anyone."
0,"Am I missing something here??  I've been anxiously waiting to visit this place because I've heard so many positive things about it.  Heck, it's been featured on the food network!  So I finally went today. \nGot there around 6:30 pm on a Friday evening and the tables were filling up quickly.  Cute decor, island music and nice youthful ambience.  I was feeling good...but not for long.  \nChips and pico were served. Took a quick glance at the menu and knew what I wanted.  Fish tacos!  What else?  The place bears the name so it must be their specialty, right?  Wrong!!  I ordered the blackened mahi fish tacos.  ($10.50 for 2 tacos +1 side).  They were wrong in all senses of the word.  Where do I even begin... \nOk, so the plate looked nice but the fish was dry and warm (I like my food hot unless its supposed to be cold).  It had absolutely no flavor.  Blackened is supposed to be very flavorful people!  The fish chunks tasted like stale, warm, low-sodium canned tuna with a hint of, I don't know, garlic powder maybe??  It had a smear of avocado, a few shreds of white cabbage, a few shreds of cheese and a drizzle of \""white cilantro sauce\"" which was so scant that I couldn't even taste it.  It was decoration, I guess.\nFor my 1 side I chose the refried beans.  Yuk!  Tastes like cheap canned beans.  I ordered a dos XX special lager on tap and it was flat and watered down.  Even the beer was a hot mess.  And here I am in shock!  I'm not quite sure what all the hype is about. This place was not very good at all.  And I don't plan on going again.  Ever!  If I want good fish tacos, I'll go to the pros... Authentic Mexican.  I'm done!  What a disappointment!"
0,"EDIT2: They charged my card AGAIN. I have now been charged four times for a one night stay. I've put a charge block on my card. Here's the saga on Vegas Chatter: http://www.vegaschatter.com/story/2012/9/4/162713/3521/vegas-travel/If+You+Stay+At+Golden+Nugget%2C+Keep+An+Eye+On+Your+Credit+Card+Statements\n\nEDIT: So, I'm fresh back from my stay this weekend and here's the rest of the story.\n\nA representative from The Golden Nugget called me on Friday and explained their billing software was not jiving well with AMEX and that's why the double charge again. He then told me I would receive $300 off the bill when I checked in.\n\nFlash forward to Saturday (my check-in day) - my husband and I check-in with surly employees at the VIP lounge, go upstairs, have a lovely stay in our suite. \n\nThen we checked out this morning and THAT's where the issues come up.\n\nThe employee who checked me out informed me we were booked to stay until 9/3. I replied to her that we had only booked one night. She then said, \""Well, whoever booked this online booked two nights. If you want to check out today there will be a $50 early check-out fee.\""\n\nI simply replied, \""No.\"" She did some typing and then, lo and behold, we didn't have to pay the fee anymore.\n\nI am utterly AGHAST at the amount and degree of billing errors I have experienced in booking one night with The Golden Nugget. From reading other reviews here, I believe this to be a systemic and reoccurring issue in this casino and hotel. \n\nI'll be calling the number of the gentleman who promised me everything would be fine during my stay to alert him to this. Even though I received a reduced rate, I cannot in good conscience recommend anyone give these people their billing information.\n________________________________________ \n\nI wish I could give this hotel NO stars. \n\nThe Golden Nugget has now charged me $530 TWICE for a stay I haven't even HAD yet! Watch your credit card if you decide to give them any of your information. \n\nThe first time was when I originally booked my stay in July. I noticed a duplicate charge on my AMEX and called them about it. I was informed they had double charged almost everyone that day and were working on getting people refunds.\n\nThey did refund me but then...\n\nOn August 27 (two days ago), I received ANOTHER CHARGE for $530 on my AMEX from The Golden Nugget, THIS time it was filed under \""Specialty Retail,\"" which a customer rep told me meant someone had charged my card in one of their shops. I haven't even stayed there yet, so this means someone has either taken down my info and used my card to charge something or they have a dangerous glitch in their accounting system.\n\nI informed them of this and after more than 20 minutes on hold, I received NO apology, no compensation, nothing. They told me I have to talk to their accounting department. The hotel manager (Roxanne Yun) said they could do nothing for me and that she \""had no knowledge\"" of the SECOND duplicate charge on my card.\n\nBasically, they told me since it didn't show up on their screens (which, why would it? It's not attached to my reservation. It's a charge on my card from an unauthorized purchase in the gift shop.) it does not exist to them and they can do nothing for me.\n\nI offered to send them statements, written instructions, etc. and she repeated to me that I would just have to talk to accounting. \n\nAgain, I would not recommend you give these people your credit card information. I'm reporting them to the FTC tomorrow morning."
0,This place is seriously ridiculous. Poorly thought out drive thru line and parking. Always slammed. I feel bad for the employees. They need to open another one near by.
1,"I have to be honest, I've not tasted the food at George & Dragon.  This is based solely on the libations.\n\nI have been there a few times for some beer and chit-chat, and my favorite thing about this place is the energy that lights the place up.  It just has a \""fun place\"" feel to it, and that opinion was shared by a couple of people I had met there now and then for some pints.\n\nIf a loud pub is not your style, this won't be either, but otherwise it's definitely worth a try."
0,"Alright, just to set the record, I gave this place 5 chances to make me not do this, and everytime that I went, I was dissapointed.  I wasn't even dissapointed by the same thing evertime I went either.  It was always something different.\n\n1st visit: I walked in, and then was ignored by the \""hostess\"" while she was on her cell phone on a \""personal\"" call.  The server brought me the wrong drink (lemonade, not ice tea?! -.- seriously...)  Even after I asked for the right drink, it never came, so I gave up.  The philly steak pita is not so great.  Very bland.  Service was just jacked up.\n\n2nd visit: Didn't get service until 23 minutes after being sat.  Trust me, I timed it.  Server didn't even apologize or even point out that we had been sitting there for quite some time.  Plus, it wasn't busy.  After the food was ordered, I never saw my server until the bill.  Brought us the wrong bill...so we had to wait another 15 minutes before we could pay...and then another 15 minutes till we got the right bill.  ARGH!!\n\n3rd visit: Ordered the salmon salad, got the salmon entree instead.  Told the server, and the server stood in front of me and argued with me about what I had ordered.  Pretty much said to my face that I was lying.  No tip, FTW!\n\n4th visit: Sat and watched my server (while our drinks were empty) stand behind the bar and chat it up with a couple of coworkers, while our food was dying in the kitchen window (you can see where the servers pick up the food from the kitchen from where you are sitting)  Estimated time in the window...14 minutes.  WHOOOO!! -.-\n\n5th Visit: This time I decided to skip the service and do a to-go.  So I call ahead...get there 15 minutes later...go up to the bar, and tell the lady...\""I'm here to pick up a to-go order under the name of Rebecca.\""  She looks at me dumb founded and then quickly goes to her computer and says \""Oh right, what did you want again?\""  Starts putting in my order as I'm standing there.  (Now what was the point in calling ahead?) Then I ask her, \""are you putting in my order right now?\"" she says, \""Uh It's okay, It'll only take like 10 minutes.\"" -.- yeah mmhmm...I watched my food sit in the window of the kitchen...for about 10 minutes.  Then some other server packed it up and put it behind the bar, and watched it sit there for another 15 minutes.  I didn't get my food until some old guy at the bar pointed out to the bartender that I had been waiting for quite sometime for my food.  So all in all, I waited for almost an hour to get my food.  With no apology from the dumb bartender.\n\nSo! My final statement here! If you have good luck, by all means run over to pita, and maybe you'll have a good experience, but as for me, you won't see me there ever again =]\n\noh btw, I had both the salmon salad and the salmon entree and both are pretty good, only if you're crazy craving salmon =]  good portion and pretty good sides that come with the entree."
1,"Best burger in Pittsburgh (yes that means better than over rated Tessaro's).  I had the Average Joe with cheddar and bacon, which was quite delightful.  To me, what makes the burger is the bun, great bun!  I also ordered some fry's to split with my wife, they were tasty as well.  Burger, fry's and a couple black and tans (not the Yuengling kind, but the real thing) how can you go wrong?  \n\nThe atmosphere is cool, we sat by the open garage door/windows so we could people watch and enjoy the nice weather.  \n\nI think I will be returning soon and frequently."
1,"Oh so my first time here and I was starving upon arrival so I ordered the platter for app and raw filet mignon with quail egg... The platter consisted of fried frog legs, a big crab cake in center, friend shrimp and scallops (I think) it was soo much but I was hungry so as a entree I ordered stuffed lobster which I did not eat all but it was good, I was really stuffed, I can't do all the fried food, it irritates my stomach so the platter wasn't a good choice but if was not nasty, quite good.. I went Luton the rooftop where the view was beautiful and they had a zip line there which I didn't get on due to dear if heights but my tummy was satisfied but def over priced in a way"
1,"Straight out of a Tarantino movie. I heart this place. My only problem is their ventilation sucks  so you reek of cigs when you leave, but it's a small price to pay. Their drinks seriously sneak up on you, beware..."
0,Avoid this place like the plague it's double the price of a regular La Salsa ( they even charge you for chips and salsa really seriously). The waitress barely spoke English and you could hardly understand her. She took the order then she was MIA she never came to check on us. To the extent that we had to get another server to refill our drinks and get the bill. LaSalsa you should be ashamed to be employing such a low caliber of employee!!!
1,"I would definitely recommend this place if your pet needs to be seen urgently. The outcome can be a bit pricey and that's why I gave it one less of a star. As well as the facility not being the cleanest. We sat in a waiting room for hours with blood on the floor.\nOn the other hand... the staff is wonderful, compassionate, and quick to help as well as keeping you at ease. They all seem knowledgable which also helps leaving your friend at their care, especially if you can't be back there with them."

1,"Wow. Love this place. We had the soul food plate with chicken fried chicken, collared greens, and beans on rice. We could have drank the white gravy from a cup it was so good. The service was fantastic and she answered all our questions. (We're as pasty white as it gets and this one of the first soul food experiences for the family.) One tip: the portions are huge so you can share. Highly recommend."
1,"I stayed at this hotel last year and it was very nice.  I love the design of the rooms.  Very fitting for New York.  The location was a bit off the main strip area, but we had a car with us so it didn't matter so much.  The best part of this hotel was all the little restaurants inside."
1,"Found this place on yelp and saw good reviews so decided to give it a try. I called in for delivery and ordered 3 tacos, a side of chips & salsa and a mango. The delivery was fast and the food was delicious! I absolutely loved the tacos and the salsa. Will definitely  be eating at this place again!"
0,"I would give this place NEGATIVE STARS if I could. I had the most horrific experience at the Treasure Island Hotel. Upon returning to our hotel room at Treasure Island after attending a wedding, at approximately 12:30am, a disturbing man was exiting OUR HOTEL ROOM with our bottle of vodka, a black laundry bag full of our valuables, and some sort of keycard. When my friends husband confronted him, the man grabbed him by the neck and pushed him against the wall and tried to escape through the door to the SERVICE ELEVATORS. I felt terrified for our safety and was worried that someone would get more hurt. We did not know if this guy could have a weapon and I trusted that security would jump in and help us stop this man. However when I looked down the hallway to see the security while the man was STILL IN THE HALLWAY AND THE ATTACK WAS TAKING PLACE, the security team was WALKING, not running, but WALKING towards us allowing the man to get away with all of our things. I felt completely unsafe and helpless. This man COULD HAVE BEEN STOPPED had the security team taken a dangerous situation seriously and had its guests best interest at heart. By the time the security team WALKED down the hallway to reach us, the man was gone. They proceeded to try and talk us out of filing a report with the police and said we can just file a report with the hotel \""IF WE WANTED TO\"". The next morning, we went to the front desk to try and be compensated for our room and there was no note of the incident that had been recorded on our reservation. SKETCHY!! They refused to reimburse anything but resort fees at $24.99/night. When my friend claimed that this was unacceptable, the on duty manager, Christopher Sheehan, threatened to call security and have her kicked out of the hotel for raising her voice in front of guests. People have the right to know how UNSAFE Treasure Island Hotel is and how poorly they treat their guests, as well as the lack of communication, action, and seriousness of dangerous situations. Treasure Island DOES NOT TAKE CARE OF ITS GUESTS or provide a safe environment. DO NOT give them your business and choose ANY OTHER HOTEL."
1,I've been coming here for years and couldn't recommend a locally owned restaurant more strongly. Great food and great people. I always come here when I am in the area.
1,"We walked a mile from our home to get here last Sunday.  I won't do that again until cooler weather prevails, but I will bike there during the crucial 24 hours each week it's open while the Public Market is closed - especially Sundays and Mondays.\n\nIt's kinda reminiscent of Dean & DeLuca in NYC and so, majorly draws me to it.  The presence of Meyer's dish soap doesn't hurt.\n\nI'll be a regular - at least until the Public Market creates Sunday/Monday hours.\n\nI have no idea how it intends to survive so far from residents on the weekends."
0,"This is \""It's A Small World\"" on crack. Medeval themed, with a cheesy old wizard in the main tower of the castle overlooking the strip. This place ONLY gets credit for being one of the first \""themed\"" hotels in Vegas. This place is pretty old, worn and nasty. The casino, rooms, and restaurants are yuck. With this prime piece of strip property, your would think the Excalibur doesn't have much left in the tank."
0,"Happy hour is a joke, service is horrible and customer service is interesting. Don't come here! They have such low quality sushi on top of having horrible service. I still paid and I paid $25 during happy hour! The pot stickers are smaller than your baby toe, thinner than a pencil and they burned them. I will not be going back a better alternative is sea star sushi off of chandler heights and power. Happy hour is only $1 off but, better sushi, better service and overall the best we have in town. It's nothing like RA I love that place but it's something small for queen creek."
1,"Mingo Is all about having a good time and is one of the restaurants that is keeping up with the atmosphere Downtown Las Vegas has created. Very relaxed, fun, and community-centric. \n\nThe food here does not take itself very seriously and that's not a bad thing, at all. The food here is definitely designed to make you feel comfortable yet still make you feel as though you aren't eating at home. A perfect example of this is their open faced egg sandwich. This is a meal any college student is probably vaguely familiar with due to it's simplicity and deliciousness. Mingo however takes that feeling of comfort, adds some delicious fotina gruyere, avocado, and thick cut bacon and serves a sandwich that is unforgettable.\n\nI highly recommend this restaurant if you are simply looking for a place to come relax, eat, drink, and feel cultured."
0,"Sigh...where do I even start. Buffets make me very happy. I am usually excited to go to one and I find that it is usually an attraction in itself. This buffet however was not the case. There was a nice little array of desserts and the salad bar was my go to. The temperature for all main items seemed off. I'm not sure if everything had been sitting out for a long time but my food was at room temperature (a big peeve for me). The breads were stale. I only rate this 2 stars due to decent desserts and salad bar. Our waitress and hostess were fabulous but other than that this place needs some improvement foodwise. The view was beautiful as we were sitting with views overlooking the Koi ponds, flamingo,  ducks, and little waterfalls."
0,Had a bug in my sake and they did not even care! Saryah was our waitress and although attentive not friendly nor apologetic about the visitor in my drink.... will I go back probably not....2 stars cause the food was good...too bad the service was NOT
0,"I have friends that swear by this place.  I do like the live music on Monday night but the food just isn't very good.  They are famous for their lasagna.  I've had it. I don't like it.  The ricotta cheese is never cooked enough.  And, there's too much of it.  I've also had some chicken dishes that are way overcooked.  I do like the ambiance though.  Maybe just drinks and dessert next time."
0,"I gave them 2 stars because they really fell off my expectations. I have been here many time, dined in almost all the restaurants and I have good experience, but staying here is a total different story. \n\nMy first night has no heat. I called front desk and they sent an \""engineer\"" to fix it and it took him almost an hour. He said he fixed it but after he left I found out there was still no heat. I called front desk again and they wants to send another engineer. It was 4:30am! They offered me to remove my resort fee but it appeared on my final bill and I have to talk them through. \n\nNot to mention the hotel rooms are old. You are better off to stay at Venetian."
0,"Owner shows up late and place couldn't open for lunch, just lost a sushi fan due to lack of business ownership!"
1,"I woke up one Sunday a few weeks back and heard a flop-flop sound as I pulled out of my garage. Well, we all know what that means, AAA came pretty quickly and filled my flat with enough air to get to a tire place. \n\nSo I did what many of us do, try to decide between Discount Tire, Firestone and Costco, etc.  I had recently purchased two tires at Discount, but I thought I give Costco a try first since our Executive Membership was about up. \n\nPlease note this was just before Christmas and the place was hopping with folks trying to buy trees off Costco's 18 wheeler.  The Christmas trees are sold from the Auto & Tire Department. \n\nI had one person in front of me and was serve pretty quickly.  Luckily for me Costco was running a special at the time of buy 3 tires, get one free.  In total, the four tires ran me less than $400 including the balancing, etc.  The wait was 2 1/2 hours, but I found a seat inside and enjoyed all the Christmas craziness from the food court seating while reading a book that I had just bought at, guess where, Costco. \n\nI was impressed and would certainly recommend the Costco tire folks to anyone.  They were friendly and great to work with. \n\nBig, WOW!"
0,"Visiting on business, I wanted something quick on a Sunday night and saw this listed under Mexican food.  The minute I walked in, I could tell that, instead of being an actual Mexican restaurant, it was simply a cheap knock-off of Chipotle (which is not really Mexican either lol). I was hungry, however, so I tried a steak quesadilla.  Average at best.  I'll give it two stars simply because it was around $5 plus a drink.  I'll stick to the real Mexican restaurants."
0,"A little surprised by all of the great reviews here, as I was very underwhelmed. Maybe I was in on a bad day? Came for lunch, and found the chinese food to be mediocre at best. The Orange chicken I had was really bad, so dry it kind of broke apart and separated when I would cut it. I also tried the sesame chicken, mongolian beef and sweet and sour pork. Some of the flavors were okay, but all of the meat felt like it was overcooked. Maybe that was just the constant reheating from a buffet style. I didn't get seconds of anything, and while I felt bad about it, I didn't completely finish anything that I took.\n\nI don't like sushi, so I didn't try that station, and no one was working the mongolian grill style area, so that wasn't an option. For what I had, I found it disappointing, and at $11+ a drink, tax and tip, it's not cheap enough to be worth it. Service was fine, and the restaurant seemed clean, which is a plus.\n\nIt may well float other people's boats, but Hong Kong Gourmet Buffet is not for me."
1,"Great classes.  The instructors are very knowledgeable and great with dogs (and people).  We did Puppy I, Puppy II, and Intermediate classes (all at the Happy Dogz Middleton location) and we'll do more in the future.  The classes were really helpful and they were fun too."
1,"Damn, they make a mean steak.\n\nMy petite filet was tasty goodness. Who can hate it when your steak comes on a plate still sizzling with butter??? My size 0 bff KILLED her ribeye - it was that good."
0,"The only reason for two stars is bc Katsuya is at the hotel. But even then, the customer service at the SLS of dumb idiots get no stars. No one obtains reliability or accountability these days. Jankiest \""new\"" hotel I have ever been to. Got into my room and the light was out, tv froze plenty of times and they have the lamest \""cable\"" tv. When I checked out, they charged me for mini bar crap that had dust on top of the boxes that I didn't even eat, when I declined room service for my entire stay. And the gnarliest thing was that there were still pubes in my shower. \n\nWhat a bunch of dumb idiots that are running the place."
0,"I read all the Yelp reviews warning about staying at Excalibur, but instead, we let our budget dictate where we stayed and ended up staying at the Excalibur after all and for the most part, regretting it.\n\nPROS:\n-Cheap. We stayed here mid-August for $32/night, plus resort fee...very good rate!\n-Family Friendly.....there's an arcade downstairs!\n-Cheap food court in hotel. They have everything, McDonald's, Quizno's, DQ/Orange Julius, Starbucks, Krispy Kremes, Chinese Food, coffee cafes at reasonable prices for the strip.\n\nCONS:\n-Excalibur is far, far, FAR away from the centre of the strip. You have to do A LOT of walking in the blazing hot sun across catwalks and through hotels to get places (unless you want to fork the money over for cabs).\n-Drab decor\n-No refrigerators (unless you want to pay $15/day)\n-A few minutes after we turned on the shower, it smelled like butt. Seriously, no other way to describe it other than butt. Luckily it went away after a few minutes, but I wasn't too impressed with that.\n-It takes a long time to walk to the bus stop (called the \""Deuce\""), which is by the Coca Cola Store.\n\nTIP#1 If you do stay here, bring a cooler and buy all your drinks ahead of time or at a grocery store or some place cheaper. Anything is cheaper than in the hotel...even the ABC/convenience type stores near Excalibur (especially for water)!\n\nTIP#2: If you want a sit down breakfast close to Excalibur, go over to \""America\"" in New York, New York hotel instead of Denny's. You'll wait FOREVER to get a table in Denny's, but you can walk into \""America\"" (FYI -Portions are HUGE at America, try sharing)\n\nNote: A taxi ride from the LAS airport to Excalibur will cost you about $15.\n\nOVERALL: This hotel was okay since it fit our budget, but all the walking in 115 degree F weather was too much....it drained our energy levels and our feet and legs hurt. I don't really care about decor when I'm on a budget....but next time, I'd consider paying a little extra just to stay in a more central location on the strip."
1,Great value for the price.  I got 2 meals out of $15 spent.  Family friendly environment with great customer service.  Join their mailing list for awesome loyalty specials.
0,"The jury is still out on them at OUR house. \nCalled them today because our system is overflowing...the only advice that I took away from the interaction is for us to bypass the Kinetico System untill they could see the system. \n\nJust for them to\""see\"" the system, it will cost us $109.00 (service call fee plus the first thirty minutes of labor). If additional work is needed, then it's $15.00 for each 15 minutes. I asked about the lifetime guarantee that I heard on KDWN radio and was told that since we purchased our system in 1997 that we wouldn't be covered.\n So I ask then, if I'm not under warranty, why should I use your company for service? I got a, \""You can do whatever you want. We ARE the only company authorized to service our system.\"" \n\nI suppose that's a great answer if a warranty WAS being honored.\nAND, to top it off, they don't guarantee an appointment time...even though they charge their customers for the visit. I don't like paying to go to the dentist for maintenance on my teeth, but at least a gal gets an appointment time for THAT service.\n\nI'm astonished at companies (that want to keep my business) would automatically charge me a fee to determine what was wrong with THEIR system. I would think that they would stop by to see what's wrong first and then determine with me the best path to resolving. The \""service\"" person wanted to immediately transfer me to sales (probably so they could try and sell me a whole new system)...I didn't want a salesperson, I wanted SERVICE."
1,"Wow, we just came here just in time on the day before Labor Day.  Only tour is at 1PM which was nice to plan ahead on our 4-hr drive from St. Paul/Minneapolis area.  The tour costs $3 for adults and $2 for children/students.  The tour is approximately 1 hour and we had a great tour with our docent, Jane.  She normally does the tour in the winter time but apparently summer time most volunteers opt out.  To our fortunate accident, Jane gave a wonderful tour of the different floors as well as outside facing the State Capitol.  We finally realized how FLW imagined how his hometown's convention center should look and feel.  I can't believe he did this for only $250 out of a labor of love.  Jane took the time to answer all questions as well as share photos and old carpeting so we knew how things used to look before some renovations.  There was a wedding banquet and almost wished we lived closer to even dream of this place.  Get here early since it looks like summer tours fill up.  There were 18 total but didn't seem to mind that we had a slightly larger crowd.  The gift shop was a bit pricey and didn't seem to find anything to our liking.  Afterwards you can walk towards the State Capitol on MLK and take a free tour."

0,"Westins almost always delight without fail, I think we just arrived at the wrong time.\n\nLocated in North Scottsdale - about 25 minutes from Old Town (where all the best spots are). The area where the Westin is is very new, and most everything is very retail/big chains oriented. It's a nice suburban area.\n\nThe service, sadly, was terrible! I don't know who is in charge of hiring and personnel management at this location, but they need to be fired. The valet service gave us the worst first impression of the hotel and made us feel incredibly unwelcome, the check-in staff was borderline rude and the concierge made a disaster of our entire evening with some of the worst recommendations I've ever gotten. It was Saturday evening and they had a prom, a wedding and a convention going on all at the same time. When we pulled up to the front the valet guys completely ignored us (you may be thinking, WELL with a prom a wedding and a convention, maybe they were busy, maybe cut 'em a little slack? I totally would have chalked it up to that but we were 1 of 3 cars there, and there were 3 valets, 2 of which were casually talking beside their stand the whole time...). Finally 1 of the 3 valet guys lazily came up to us as we were getting our bags out of our car and asked if we wanted help, we said sure and he then said okay and walked away! haha - I don't know if he didn't understand us or what, but he looked like he did. It was weird. We then lugged our bags in ourselves through the incredibly crowded lobby area to the check in desk and my husband went back to park the car. There were 4 people at the check-in desk but only 2 were actively checking people in. Then after 10 minutes of waiting in line I was told we were in the wrong building for the villas and we had to go about half mile down the road to check in (which HAD the valet dude actually been helping us, might have saved us 20 minutes of stressful overload and an overall negative first impression of this Westin.) \n\nWhen we finally did get checked in, we went to the concierge and were \""helped\"" by Allan. Do NOT ask this dude for his dining recommendations, we asked him for his recommendations on a place with local-flare and high-end service. He recommended Sol Mexican Cocina (which was chain-like, had disgusting food - fish stick calamari & margaritas that they brag are made with sour mixes) and the Westin's restaurant Deseo. The restaurant Deseo is utterly underwhelming - if atmosphere and service are factors you care about in a dining experience, pass on this place."
0,"Maybe I was just there on a bad night.  It wasn't bad enough that I'm never going back but it definitely didn't live up to the dining experience I was expecting.  \n\nPlusses:  Great bar menu, drinks and service.  I'm definitely going back there for drinks.  (Awesome people watching)\n\nMinuses:  Dinner was so-so.  My biggest complaint was the pace of service.  I love a well paced meal but I also like a little attention.  We'd go for 30 minutes at a time without even so much as water top off.  When your water class sits empty (and you've paid for the Voss), that's a sign that they aren't interested.  BTW, I would have pored it myself but they keep the bottles off the table.\n\nThey have DJ on Thursday evenings.  Which actually is kind of cool but I wasn't prepared for it and it got a little loader than I was expecting for a \""romantic\"" dining experience."
0,"Been there for lunch a couple of times. The first time I was not impressed, and rather neutral about the experience. But I thought it was because I was on the phone w/ biz the entire time. \n\nWent last week w/ a few folks from my office. Omg! We were thoroughly disappointed. Let's start w/ the chips and salsa. They serve a complementary salsa trio. Red, green and pico de gallo. The traditional salsa was borderline gross! No flavor and funky texture. The salsa verde was ok but not great. I asked for hot salsa....they didn't have one. Huh??! \n\nThe food was par at best and the service was worse! The restaurant was not busy and we had to search for our server for any and everything. We had to ask for our check and 15 min later, she still hadn't come to collect the bill. Tick Tock! Tick Tock! C'mon lady....I've got stuff to do!!! I had to take the credit card to her!!! \n\nThe icing on the cake was my asking for a to-go cup for my freshly poured iced tea. She brought me a soup container!! No thanks! \n\nMeh! I'm cool on this place!"
0,Place was ok for pho fried rice very plain and over filled with onions and vegetable over all won't go again
0,"WE expected so much more!  Called to make reservation, young women said there was a dress code, no jeans, needed a shirt with collar, etc.  That Was BALONEY.  People were casually dressed - a BIG disappointment.  THe food was mediocre.  foie gras with blueberry jam, REALLY!!!  Crabcakes were fishy.  Snapper was soppy.  Service was O.K.  GO TO PICASSO at the BELLAGIO if you want a wonderful meal.  Don't go here."
1,Went here and had some amazing gelato! I highly recommend this place to both visitors in the area and those that live here. Wonderful in every way!
1,"Sashimi lover's rejoice! An all you can eat sashimi restaurant for a decent price.  \n\nHikari (as everyone else has pointed out) is a 3-section restaurant.  \n\n1) Steak house\n2) Tepenyaki\n3) Sushi!!!! (guess which one we went to!)\n\nFor valentine's Day, My lady wanted to go here so we did.  We were seated JUST as they opened and were greeted very warmly by everyone there.  The sushi chefs first asked, \""Are you doing all you can eat?\"" And of course we said yes.  That's when the floodgates opened.  The sushi chefs and wait staff are VERY attentive and very generous and you can't forget, very fun(ny).  \n\nWe started off with the normal sashimi; ahi, yellowtail, salmon, etc.  The lady also asked for some oysters (I'm not a big fan of them) and they just yelled out, \""One Dozen Oysters!\""  Every person there that ordered oysters was given a dozen.  Usually at an AYCE place,  You'd think they'd be kinda cheap with it and only give you 1 at a time, but this place was hugely generous.  It was even better when she told them I don't eat oysters so they took 10 of them back without complaining.  \n\nSo aside from the massive amounts of raw fish and rolls what sets this place apart?  Well, as an AYCE place, they have a REALLY good selection.  I already mentioned the oysters, but they also have scallop sashimi, uni and baby sweet shrimp on the menu.  First place I've seen that has these high price items on it.  \n\nThe scallops were where my lady friend went nuts.  She probably ate 15 total and the chef realized this.  The third time she asked for scallops, he said, \""Let me see your plate!\"" and plopped down 6 scallops on the plate.  Then asking \""Is that enough?\"".  You could see her eyes light up as we all had a good chuckle on the playfulness with the chef.  \n\nAbout 80% of the way through the meal, we asked on a whim, \""Do you have salmon belly?\"" And they did!!! Oh man I was in heaven.  \n\nThere is one drawback on the food aspect. It's all you can eat for about $28.  How fresh do you REALLY think the fish is?  It's fresh enough to be yummy but not fresh enough to be YUMM-O.   With the Uni, scallops, oysters, salmon belly, I'd definitely say it's worth it but it's not a place for me to go back every time I'm in vegas.\n\nSo why the 5th star?  What made it for me was the service.  That's where the extra star comes in.  The sushi chefs are generous and attentive as is the wait staff.  My tea never was empty and we always had fish in front of us.  One of the perks of being a smaller venue with 2 chefs.  They can give you more attention.  Also they're fun!  The sushi chef said, \""All you can eat anything on the menu... including me!\"" In which my lady friend said, \""Okay I'll take you!\""  His reply?  \""Okay I'll meet you after work\"".  My only advice was that he show up with scallops.  \n\nMy word of advice is to make a reservation.  We didn't have to worry about it since we were there so early but it is small.  I can see this place filling up.  I'd say it can hold about 20 people total."
1,Good service and yummy French food! I had the Gazpacho and the vegetable crepes and they were both delicious.
0,"This place is horrible. The service is so bad and the beer is inconsistent, at least they had some this time. The food was great but I don't know why it took over an hour to get it. Long story short I will not be returning to this place. Whoever owns this establishment should look for a new line of work."
0,"I really want this place to be good as I live 2 blocks away from it this would be so damned convenient. The place is beautifully modern, It has plenty of parking which it needs for all the cars I see each day going in and out. My girl loves the salmon they have and the drinks are to her liking. My problem with it is not the wait time while waiting to have a table open but the service I have had when I dined there three or four times I have been there. \n  \n I will admit to the last time I went there that I got rude for the first time in my adult life with a waiter as the neglect and bad service seemed to be intentional and I took offense. Every time I have went I have had the same waiter. An older gentlemen who seems to have his share of tables which is the first problem but has a quiet disdain for everyone(never see him smile)mixed with the disability of peripheral vision, or is it a superpower?\n\n I don't have high expectations and as long as someone is fairly decent I will say great service but each and every time I went this guy was never helpful it took 10-15 minutes the last time for him to acknowledge our table for the first time( not after taking a drink order mind you). I wanted to walk out and became a little vocal. Yes he was busy and he was serving a large party but as you are delivering food to the table throw in a \"" sorry i will be with you soon\"" or jot down a quick drink order. So after that we get a drink order and he's gone again and we are invisible again. I don't know if it's some personal vendetta where he was insulted the first time by me still tipping 20% and that some how triggered a blood debt in his book but it was terrible each and every time. I am hoping when they expand that they will have to hire more staff and maybe I can get a lottery pick of anyone but him. To end the dining experience after waiting and trying to flag the man down once again I went to the bar to ask for the check and made it a note to mention how bad the service was.  That was the last time I went. \n\nSo besides the service which I do think is slow not on just his part but at the bar and in the kitchen also, The food is sub par for me and I have had quite a few dishes trying to find the thing that they are special at which I didn't find in my trips before writing it off. Here is a rundown of my opinion:\n\nService: 0/5 please fire him if you haven't since the last time I have been there\n(hint hes the guy the never is pleasant and looks like him, well not him but another actor with darker skin and green eyes who played villains in 80's movies):\nhttp://www.imdb.com/media/rm218601984/nm0001424\n\nAmbiance: 5/5 lovely place and would love to know who helped with the remodel, music was nice and mellow.\n\nFood:\nSalmon - 5/5 supposedly really good, not a fish fan so my girlfriend vouches for it.\nChicken and waffles: 2/5 my order of chicken was burnt, the crust was just a hard shell of black/brown dough, the waffles were nice though.\nskirt steak: 2/5 like someone dropped a bottle of pepper on accident on it, been a while that is all I remember I think it came with some potatoes that were ok\ncheese curds: 2/5 ours were soggy,and had a pool of grease at the bottom but the ones with crisp were good.\nroasted garlic: 3/5 actually not too bad but terrible on the stomach \nI had a couple other favorites but never tried the pork sandwich which is known to be great.\nHome-made ginger ale: 0/5 is strong and terrible"
0,"Good Food. Fantastic Service. Unethical Business Practices.\n\nWe ate there every day while staying at Aria from 17-23 December 2013 due to a promotion where they provided a $68 buffet voucher per night.\n\nThe food variety is relatively small to other places but the quality is top notch.\n\nThe wait staff is second to none. They were super attentive and friendly and collectively made the best service experience I've ever had in Vegas.\n\nSo here's the bad part. Two days in to our voucher deal they nearly doubled the price per person for the buffet. They called it \""Holiday Brunch\"" or something like that. Nothing changed (food or service) except for the price which went up $20 dollars per person. The \""free\"" buffet deal turned out to be anything but. The place wasn't even more crowded than usual.\n\nI understand Vegas exists to vacuum the cash out of your bank account but the gimmick pulled by Aria's management over the buffet price amounted to cheating their customers. \n\nDon't treat your customers like complete suckers and they may just return with their business. It's no wonder MGM resorts posts billions in losses on a regular basis."
0,"The food is  decent.  I had a bad experience with the woman at the register and she was totally rude!!!  I called and spoke to the owner, but he didn't seem to care....so I didn't care to go back to the business.  I would rather spend my money at a place that values it's customers.  Hey, we are the ones keeping them in business after all."
1,"We tried the Rosarito, Monterey and the Berry Delight. All were very good, perfect portion size and delicious. I had a blood orange mimosa which was more champagne then juice, which is fine by me. Not sure I'd order it again with the blood orange.  The staff was friendly and efficient. We will be back!"
1,We were trying to choose a new place for lunch at work and this was mentioned. We all LOVED it! (that is saying a lot!) We ordered off the online menu and I called it in (she was VERY friendly) it was ready in less than 10min and was hot and delicious!!! It also doesn't cost an arm and a leg and is close enough to go there fairly often. We will be back!
1,"I just moved to Vegas from the LA area. This restaurant reminds me of home. Super hip, great food, great wine, etc... The only thing different is the crowd. The crowd is a mix, not just a bunch of hipsters. I like it, less pretentious. The staff is super knowledgeable about the wines and friendly. I haven't tried it yet, but you can get wine by the ounce. How awesome is that! It's the kind of place you could get a little dressed up for or go casual. The prices are great for what you get. I love this home away from home."
1,"The Baer's Den is my bar of choice in Arizona!  Hands down the best service I have ever gotten at a bar, it's like my own Cheers.  Literally when I walk in I am greeted with my name by any of the bartenders, the cook staff, or Scott the owner.  I host a Red Sox fan group that meets at the Baers Den and I can say without hesitation that the ENTIRE staff goes way above and beyond to make our experience a great one.  As far as the parking goes?  Yes space is limited behind the bar itself and that is a shame because it get packed in there from time to time.  There is plenty of signage behind the bar including a sign that has got to be 4' x 8' hanging on the back of the building that has a VERY CLEAR message about parking illegally.  If someone is unable to see the signage back behind the bar, then they shouldn't be behind the wheel to begin with cause that person is putting the rest of us with eyesight at danger.  If you are looking for a great bar with friendly people where the majority of the patrons know each other, then THIS IS YOUR PLACE!   By the way, notice how the only bad review came from someone that parked illegally, and by the owner who didn't want to self gloss and call his bar the best (which it is)?  By the way, the bar has been in business for over 50 years!  That doesn't happen to places that are not GREAT!  Also, good luck bothering the Police and the City with this matter, it's private property so it's a civil matter not a criminal matter.  You sound stupid, occupy self responsibility Lori F!"
0,My chicken parm was okay. But my mom ordered the salmon and that was amazing. My Aunts was also ok and why it only got 2 stars. I would expect for consistency especially with how prices all the food is. Having to track down your waiter is another reason for its low score
1,It was great.  Cheap compared to other shows in vegas.  Very funny and cool magic..i think this is the only afternoon shows in vegas so we went to check it out before we went to the airport.  I really enjoy it!!  Highly recommend it!!! I paid 2 tixs for only $26.  If you sit in the front you might get pick to go up on the stage!
1,"This mall has been since as long as I've lived here in Vegas. It's been through some changes over the years, but it remains clean, up to date, safe and clean...did I say clean twice?\nI've seen some dumpy malls before, not here in town, but still, consider yourself lucky we have some decent mall here.\nNo, this isn't a Fashion Show type mall and I'm glad for that. Keep your tourist dollars and ridiculous prices on the strip. This is the everyday mans (and woman's of course) mall in the burbs. Got all the stores covered, big department stores, boutiuques, food court (of course) and Spencers...what's a mall without a Spencers?!\nI do miss the sit down style restaurants though. Some of you may remember the old days when they had Der Baron's and a Mexican place I think was a Ricardo's. Anyway, those are gone so food choices are the food court and the obligatory pretzel stand."
1,"The pancakes are delicious. I had the blueberry lemon poppy seed pancake with the whipped cream cheese topping, it was great. I would put the whipped cream cheese on everything. I also had the veggie burger. It was good but I think the breakfast here is awesome:)"
0,"While usually the place you go when the Essenhaus is too full (or your ears are bleeding from the incessant polka), the Come Back is a fairly standard Wisco bar.\r\n\r\nOf note is their breakfast. Though the service can be spotty, the food is pretty tasty, especially if hung-over.  Case in point: I ordered some sort of canjun steak benedict and it was so tasty (or I was so bleary) that I missed the fact that the dish was lacking  eggs until the end of the meal.\r\n\r\nReview update: I need to stop rating places when I'm so hung-over I can barely type.  Visiting the Come Back In not clouded by the haze of last night's whisky can be a risky proposition.  Rude waitstaff, misplaced orders, and centipeds become much harder to deal with when clear-minded."
1,This place is like a popcorn lovers dream! Such good flavors. The owner is very nice and helpful. It's great that you can sample as many flavors as you wish (this makes it hard to pick flavors lol.)  I really love this place I'm glad it's so close to home! My favorite flavor is the cookies and cream. I never would have thought this would be my favorite flavor but it's taste is great and it actually has pieces of cookies! Popcorn is a little expensive but the quality and taste are so good it's worth paying a little more. I hope this place is here for the long haul!
1,"This is a great place to go if you are looking for a good steakhouse in Vegas.  \n\nWe went here w/ a group of 17 for a friends b-day.  It took us sometime to get seated even if we made reservations but we did request for a private room.  \n\nWhile waiting we sat at the bar.  There was someone playing the piano who took requests - hello Billy Joel songs! \n\nYou also need to check out their James Bond table.  It will suddenly open and play songs from the movie.  It also has wine that is etched w/ the different James Bond movies.\n\nOnce we were seated, service was fast and good.  The B and I shared a porterhouse and crab legs.  I like my steak w/ bone and medium rare.  Our steak came medium but the server was quick to get us a new piece of steak when we complained.   The steak was coated in a seasoning of spices w/ lots of pepper.  It was really good!  Perfectly seared outside and rare inside.  Delish!  The crab legs were really good too.\n\nWe also ordered Oysters (west coast) - I like the sweeter variety. They were also superb.  Did I mention the sesame bread that comes before the meal?  It was served warm as any good restaurant should and w/ whipped butter - I think it was sweet cream butter.\n\nThis one takes the cake. Lobster Mac and Cheese!  You have to get it.  It's the best mac and cheese I've ever had in my whole life.\n\nI will come back anytime."
0,Let me starting by saying that I wasn't expecting a mind blowing experience but I was expecting decent. We have limited delivery in our area and we wanted to try something different than your typical fast food chain delivery. Our experience was terrible. We live about ten minutes away and it took over an hour and 15 min get get our order. The caesar salad arrived with dressing on it that was like 3 times the amount of dressing anyone would want on their salad! Who delivers a salad with dressing on it? The pizza was vile. It tasted like soggy cardboard. There was no flavor what so ever and the basil on the too was charred and you couldn't even tell it was suppose to be green. Will not be visiting again.
0,"PLEASE STAY AWAY FROM THIS AGENT! I have had the worst experience with this agent. I've been mis lead and lied to about coverage for my vehicle. Makes promises to take care of the issue and call me back but then never does. I opened my policy with State Farm on 7/4/14 provided a quote for full comp & collision. The stated that underwriting found lapse of insurance / uncleared suspension which i provided proof of and they advised me that all would be taken cared of. Which was untrue!\n\nOn Nov 6th i was involved in an accident and after filing the claim i came to find out that my policy was for Liability only. Sarah apologized sincerly & said that she would rectify the situation with underwriting/claims & caell me back to confirm. I never received another call from her. On Monday I called again & spoke with another rep and she said he would follow up...never heard from her either.\n\nI was finally able to recieve assistance from Valerie Green another State Farm location. Within 15 minutes she was able to provide me with answers to my policy that Sarah H & her office were unable to do in 4 months. Sarah H office emailed Valerie right away & advised her that i was not covered & that a NYS DMV Abstract is not a valid proof that a suspension has been cleared. If that was the case why would Sarah's office not inform me of that sooner? I sent the document to her in Sept. & it takes her 2 months later to inform not even me but another agent?\n\nI thought that an agent is supposed to protect you and your vehicle / assist you with ensuring your meeting the requirements as per NC regulates.\n\nOver all, the experience with this agent has been the worst i have even experienced with any other insurance company. I now have over $ 4000 in damages to my car & since it was a hit and run, i am not covered through either my insurance (since i only have liability). So i now have to repair my vehicle all out of pocket.\n\n In addition, the claims dept. closed out my claim becu.ase i didn't have collision...never s.ent me a letter to advise me of why they closed the claim and never asked if i was even hurt? I had to beg for them to reopen the claim. Please..please stay away from this office. I completely recommend the office at the Arboretum located at 7510 Pineville Matthews Road #13B\nCharlotte, NC 28226."
1,"Just had Xmas breakfast and what a positive difference new mgmt makes. Service was great and the food has made a huge improvement.  I can't wait to try the \""burger bar.\"" I hope their soups it is little change. Oh, the size of the meals are big as ever. Will be back soon. Need to get their website back up to post their menu."
1,"Great salon! Everyone is genuinely really nice, especially the owner. Anna is very sweet - my nails always look great! Definitely my go to nail salon."
0,"The place is literally a combat zone in the evenings.  So packed with people it's impossible to keep clean.  A steamy, dishroom atmosphere pervades the place.  Most of the help are of questionable US citizenship.  The food reminds me of a USMC chow hall on a bad day.  I'll give this place 2 stars for one reason:  They give vets a free meal on Veterans Day."
1,"I went with my friends yesterday to get a mani-pedi. As for my nails, amazing jobs!!! I got shellac on my toes and a French on my nails. Lana did an impeccable job. My friends and I definitely will be back. I'm so happy I found a place after moving here. From now on I'll be hitting up this spot and have already recommended it to others."
0,"My daughter signed a contract with Atlasta to do her wedding.  They couldn't deliver on the things that they promised so they just canceled the contract.  I heard some of their experienced staff have left the company and we were dealing with inexperienced people, who have no concept of what a wedding should be.  We wasted 5 months working with them and lost our deposit on the banquet hall.  I heard from friends in the industry that this used to be a great catering company but is now going downhill.  I'd be very careful dealing with Atlasta.  If you want pain and anxiety, you've got it.  There are a lot of very good caterers and resorts who are just as good or better and so much easier to work with."
1,"In preparation for a Vegas list I am putting together for future reference, I am back tracking on this review from a few years ago when I saw U2 and spent a few days in Vegas. I hit this Buffet at least twice when I stay. One of the best Buffets on the strip. It has every ethnic culture covered, one of the best chefs working and for what you pay is $$$, it's still a good deal. One of the most do things when in Vegas."
1,"Dare I say that The Summit Room is the best new restaurant in Charlotte?! Yes, I do!\n\nThe concept is fantastic.  The owner had an epiphany moment after climbing Mt. Kilimanjaro which lead her to open The Summit Room!  The cuisine is southern inspired but is so much more than that. Dishes like shrimp Banh Mi sliders and hummus with harissa add a definite international touch.  \n\nI went with my family for Restaurant Week and was simply wowed.  I ordered the French Pear martini (Grey Goose La Poire, St. Germain and a Prosecco topper).  I hoped to try another craft cocktail, but this was so delicious, I ordered a second! \n\nWe shared the Banh Mi sliders which were incredible and flavorful! For my entr\u00e9e, I ordered the stuffed cod (not on Queen's Feast menu) which was the perfect dish for a summer meal. I really loved the slight sweetness from the parsnip puree. I also highly recommend the pork belly if you're going for Restaurant Week.  \n\nFor dessert, I sampled my mom's Krispy Kreme donut bread budding.  Holy crap, that is one delicious dessert. What is not to love about a hot and now in bread pudding form!? YUM.\n\nGo to Summit Room...now!!"
1,Okay I've been to a few buffets in Vegas and I never thought carnival would be one of the ones I would visit off the strip ??? It was good for the price and I tried most of the different selections and to my surprise it was all good !!! I would recommend a visit off the strip and come to Rio you'll be happy ;) and you'll save some cash $$$$$$$$
0,Good service & cold beer. I would recommend drinking here and eating elsewhere.
0,"Been there twice.  Once because of a Groupon.  Service was pretty good except the server cheated us out of some change at the end (a common occurrence we are noticing in the Las Vegas area).  The food tasted good and the setting is cozy, yet kinda cool.  Like an upscale sports bar with better food and not TVs.\nWe wanted to avoid the NYE strip traffic so we went to Sedona with a couple friends this past NYE and it pretty much sucked.  We had reservations and despite arriving on time, had to wait about 25 min. to get to seated. In the meantime we sat at a bar table and it took a while for us to get our drinks.  The bar server told us the beers 2 of us wanted were not available, then the check came out with the unavailable beers listed on it..  I received the wrong drink altogether.  Then we were seated so we asked to transfer the bill as we hadn't ordered food yet.  Our server said it wouldn't be a problem but the bar server i guess wanted her own tip or something cuz she came back saying she \""needed to close out\"" our bill separately.  Yet once we paid she just left the book there with her tip in it.  (Oh yeah, this was after it took her like another 20 min to bring back the change in the first place.)\nMeanwhile we were presented with additional \""pre fixe\"" menus, then a few minutes later told that they were out of them.  In addition the server told us a few other items on the reg menu they were out of.  Seems very unprepared and unprofessional for an established restaurant serving people on NYE.\nThe rest of the service was fine and all the food tasted very good but not sure if we can get past the above issues.. Feel free to check it out for yourself.  If you have low expectations hopefully you won't be disappointed."
0,"On the surface, a not bad hotel. Not in a great location, not a big Vegas extravaganza, almost Kimpton in it's redesign. But don't let the surface details fool you-this is a varnished cardboard mock up of a nice hotel. All the details are as cheap as possible, and you'll be nickle and dimed in unexpected ways, and screwed to big dollars signs in the ways you'd expect.  And the spa? I walked put after being kept waiting for 25 minutes for my appointment, so I can't speak to the actual experience (that was the hotel's unforgivable moment)\n\nTropicana is lipstick on a pig. Expect nothing, and it's probably worth staying here"
1,It is now called neat freak car wash. I took my Honda accord in to get washed and the inside detailed. It was very well priced and the customer service exceeded my expectations. I will definitely go back again.
0,"If I could give a negative star rating I would. I will say that I have had 4 previous experinces with 2 stylists who were great. they were patient with my 3 year old and gave him a great cut. Then today happened. Like the other reviewer stated long wait time, stylist looked at us and walked into the back room. when she finally appeared I wished she had stayed in the back. My 3 yr old sat for the trimmers but started to cry when she got the scissors. I kept looking at his hair and something was off, I finally realized she went over an inch too high with the clippers and it was uneven in the back beyond repair. How do I know this, my parents owned and operated a salon for 20 yrs, I spent many days after school sweeping hair! When I called out her mistaked she claimed it could be blended. Finally another stylist came over and had to give her instructions on how to fix it. That tells me she is an inexperienced stylist. She continued to make it worse, now my son is in full meltdown and if she moved any slower she wouls be stopped. I finally told her to buzz his head. Then she refused to clean up his neck and trim his ears all the while saying it was his fault she did an uneven cut with the clippers. Really we blame 3 yr olds? She continued to argue then stomped into the back room. I packed up my kids, some 20 something mgr appeared and while she was asking what happened stylist 2 chimed in. At this point I an livid and yelling. Long story short they jacked my sons hair to the point it had to be shaved, NEVER once said SORRY and continue to blame it on him. I left without paying. The punch line, I called my husband and told him the story and he asked me what she looked like. I described her and it turns out that 3 weeks earlier she cut my husbands hair and jacked it so bad that when he walked through the door I burst out laughing. It was probably his fault for moving.LOL I will never be back an will tell everyone with an ear to avoid this place like the plague."
1,"Butterfield's is in my neighborhood.   Have been a customer from almost their first day open. Rock solid breakfast. Lots of regulars there. All of the standards plus a few greats (the bacon skillet with poached eggs on top is a good one!) I have had breakfast at \""Butterball's\"" (as my teenagers affectionally refer to it) probably in excess of 50 times.  If you are a hater, go somewhere else, more room for those of us who love good service, a smile and a breakfast that is as fit or fattening as you desire.  I have had just about everything on the menu, including lunch, and my only complaint is their coffee.  A bit bitter.  Love, love, love the OJ.  On Sundays, get there early before the post-church crowd...."
0,"For the price we paid and what we got? 2.5 stars the most. \n\nWe chose Royal British Hotel for its location - right across from the train station that we were arriving in the late afternoon via train and didn't wanted to walk far dragging our luggage behind. We needed to stay just one night as we had reservation with other hotel from the next night. \n\nOur room was on the 4th floor. Got into an elevator and it only went to the 3rd floor. Then there was really small awkward stairs leading up to the 4th floor. It was like the 4th floor was just an add on to the hotel.... Our room was an attic. Very tightly designed room with 2 shades that were half broken and a view from the window was roof top of our hotel and there were old furniture and trash shoved on the corner and cigarette butts. Great...\n\nThank goodness we had a better hotel booked from the next day but if I had to stay here for a week, I'd be checking out after 2 nights the most. Maybe it is a good hotel to stay for a short time for its convenient location, but there are tons other hotels that makes you feel like you are in Edinburgh not your grandma's old attic, so go look for those ones."
0,"Good food can be quickly forgotten by bad service.  I'm sorry that you've got the table from hell, but out table is important too!\n\nThe micro brew samplers were interesting and tasty, but nothing else screamed repeat and come back here."
0,"Ugh this place was super crowded when I visited quite a while back. Waited for probably 30 minutes to get in, and that's with our names on the \""list\"", and being an all female group. I saw others still at the back when we were leaving. Also saw a lot of money changing hands to get people in ahead of the line... guess that's standard procedure. There were some B list reality stars hosting (maybe D list?) and the drinks were super expensive. We left this place really early and went to Drai's, which was a lot more fun."
1,"Best part... A new growler filled at $8.99.  next...Accept that this is casino food first of all, but the micro IPL is great BTW.  It wasn't the best meal but when I stated there was a problem, they were quick to fix it and more than sympathetic to my issue.  I would definitely try it again.   As long as you have a little time on your hands it seems like nicanugh a place."
1,"I got a lithotripsy done here yesterday. While the check in process was a little slow, all personnel, from receptionist to the nurses, and even the 'stretcher driver' was kind, helpfull and upbeat. I felt really cared for, and everybody was very professional. The whole process took about 5hr and i was on may happy"
0,"I have been a regular customer here. Every single time I get my car washed, I swear to God it takes this bunch of teen workers forever. The manager had to yell at them to drive the car through the tunnel. They will lose me as a loyal customer because of these lazy kids. Tsk tsk."
1,"It's as good as it gets for dry cleaning, I guess!  Unfortunately, I don't have a list of what to look for in a dry cleaner, but I'm pretty particular on how I like things to be, and they haven't disappointed me yet.  \n\nRepairs have always been done properly, and my clothes always come back to me in tact, crisp and clean.  Their prices are great, and the ladies who work there are very pleasant.  If you sign up for their email list, you get coupons.  I've never paid their standard price of $2.25 a piece, and even that's cheap.  \n\nAnd c'mon people - I see some of you walking to your offices with your wrinkled suits.  Bring them here.  I beg you."
0,"This place left a lot to be desired. We chose this place because of its great reviews. We went on Mother's day and was sad to see that they decided not to do their happy hour because of this. The rolls we got were okay but nothing spectacular, and the atmosphere was pleasant. The staff was kind and quick, which was about the only plus side. Long story short... we are going to stick with Mido as our regular spot."
1,I had my first experience here last Friday night. The service and food was excellent. Things started out a bit shaky as they had a very loud wedding party in the dining room and I was concerned it would ruin the evening. Luckily they left about 20 minutes after our arrival and the rest of the night was perfect.\nI am a fan and I will go again!
0,"Probably some of the least impressive rooms I've ever seen in Las Vegas. The casino and Paris vibe are decent, but not happy with the rest of my experience.\n\nThe rooms are standard hotel rooms. They must've decided not to carry the Paris theme into the rooms for some reason. And there seemed to be a lot of wear and tear in the rooms. The TVs are old and the remote hardly worked.\n\nThe worst part was the nickel and diming. They wouldn't let me check into my room a couple hours early without paying an extra $25. Wouldn't be so bad, except their check-in times were like 4pm. Also, internet is not free.\n\nI guess like everything in Vegas, the whole purpose is to get you there and then slowly take money away from you. For some reason I expected more from the Paris."
1,"Very nice place, clean with good food and an awesome attention. I was there on a sunday around 5pm. Bartender was super nice and very helpful. Food was good. Not extraordinary but very good. Good place for a date or a meeting."
0,"Actually if I could this would be 0 stars. After 45 mins of waiting on appetizers, having to ask for a drink refill and then our food coming out before the app and being completely wrong, I walked out. I have never walked out on a table in my life. I served tables for 5 yrs myself. Very very very disappointed."
0,Went for brunch and was disappointed but based on the reviews I decided to give hulas another chance for happy hour  I would say drinks only. The food was bland as just sad ex: the rice not cooked and was actually crunchy
1,"I'm in love with this adorable little shop! It's PERFECT! Something for everyone, you'll never leave empty-handed! The owners are warm and friendly and so helpful!"
1,"I intensely love this place. This is only the second French restaurant I have eaten at, I love this place.\n\n1. Sitting on the patio is a very special experience. there are tiny little birds that hop around you trying to find bread crumbs. the patio is the epitome of romantic!\n\n2. I have never had fresher grapefruit\n\n3. Organic yogurt parfaits? YES PLEASE.\n\n4. Orange juice is magnificent. \n\n5. Breakfast menu is just perfect. Goodness yes...I love breakfast at Mon Ami Gabi!"
1,"Normal Dutch bros!! Not quite the same as my trusty McQueen Dutch bros but these guys still rock!! Love the coffee and other drinks. Super friendly staff and they always great you with a smile! I'd be fine with making this my daily stop if it was my neighborhood. Try some of the blended drinks! You can always ask for sugar free, caffeine free and fat free if you want!! Happy Coffee days!"
1,"Fastest lunch ever.  Great vegan options.  Friendly service.  I wish my wife liked Chines because it would definitely be a dinner option.  For now, it's my quickie lunches at the bar.  Fried rice and crispy tofu!"
0,"I really want to like this place. Why? Because I love the Mad Greek in Baker. I get in that long line, never look at the menu, when it's my turn I order the falafel. Never had anything else ... Falafel, tahini, rice, pita, small salad ... It's always excellent!!\n\nWent to this locale last week since the outside decor made me think that the food would be as good as the Baker locale. Not so ...\n\nThe guy said they were the same company, same menu.\nI ordered the falafel of course. Extra $2 for rice or fries, What?! Ok, I ordered rice. When my meal arrived, there were fries. Good thing I didn't send it back because those fries were the best part. Maybe the turnover is slower but the falafel were heavy, pita was not as light & fluffy, and they were out of tahini so he gave me hummus.\n\nI'll give them one more try, even though this visit was very disappointing. Maybe they'll get their act together. This place is far from my home but a lot closer than Baker!!"
0,"For this review I would give NO stars if I could.\nI purchsed an office chair about 1 year or so ago and bought the extended warrantee.\nThe chair broke so I filed a claim.\nI have been without an office chair since June 9th now because they run you through all sorts of hoops to get your money back to buy a new chair.\nTomorrow will be one month and they just barely emailed me that they will issue the refund SOON!!! SERIOUSLY?!?!?!\nShame on the warrantee company, shame on Staples for PUSHING the warrantee on you, and SHAME on staples for using such a lousy service."
0,"Everything about the pedi was ok except the polishing part.  12 hours later I had to wear shoes, and the polish smudged because it was slopped on so thick it never would have dried. \n\nAs she was polishing my nails, I was thinking, \""Man, that is way too thick!  It'll never dry!\"", but I didn't say anything because I thought maybe she had some super topcoat that would make the impossible possible.  Well, she didn't, and the polish stayed not just tacky, but downright WET for 4 hours, before I finally just SCRAPED the goop off and painted them myself.  \n\nI will never be back, and wish I had saved my $30 (I had a Groupon) and my $15 tip.  Should have just done them myself."
1,"The holy grail of tacos... Believe the hype. This is the end all be all of my happiness for food. Best tacos ever, hands down. The exterior of the restaurant is a little rough looking and isn't very visible from the road. Also, I do wish the menu was more descriptive in regards to what the tacos were garnished with ect. Our food came out quickly and the service was good. Overall this was win and I can't wait to return. \n\nItems Ordered:\n(Tacos) Shrimp, chorizo, fish & crane asada \n\nCarne asada quesadilla with a side of rice and black beans."
1,"New property with friendly staff, clean rooms, comfy beds, and good location near shopping. Only negative is that it doesn't carry all of the TV channels I like, that's important to the business traveler in me (eh em...Disney channel *cough* get it *cough*)."
1,"We had a really wonderful dinner here....and not only because our waiter could easily have been a model... he was lovely and sadly I've already forgotten his name. I digress... \n\nWhile I was in town for a conference we heard this place was awesome. On a side note, the bathroom is super cool... We ate out on the patio & they are so nice they even set down cloth napkins for us to set our purses on (is this an out west thing?) Anyhow, we all ordered various specialty drinks and we were all pleased with out choices. We started off with the quac, which they make table side. It was delicious and the chips were also good. The quac is spicy because they do put jalapenos in it if you like (which we did!). I had Mahi tacos because after the quac and late lunch I wasn't particularly starving. The tacos were delicious. If you are starving, this would probably not be enough food for you, but perfect for a light meal. My dining companions were also pleased with their meals. The service was great and we never felt rushed or hurried, and they had just the right amount of attentiveness. I would eat here again if I ever roll through town again."
1,Excellent Pizza. Our Waitress was extremely snobby. Im sure it was just her.. However had salad with bresaola was great very simple nice clean flavors.. The Pizza is awesome Best Pizza and best ingredients so far in Vegas.
1,"I hold Yelp responsible for all my weight gain. What happens is that I read the yummy reviews posted by fellow yelpers and bookmark all these places in my head. When a craving hits me, I miraculously remember these places and head there without delay.\nI read several reviews about the chocolate malted crunch and wanted to have it TODAY. The place was a little busy but the wait was not long. I asked to taste the c.m.c flavor and liked it a lot! With 1 scoop of vanilla and 1 of c.m.c I was a happy camper with a full tummy.\n\nThe choc was on the sweeter side and reminded me of frozen version of a malted choc drink I used to drink when I was young. The vanilla was ok.\n\nOverall, a yummy treat!!"
0,"I think staying at the Imperial Palace hotel was my first on the Las Vegas Blvd. Strip hotel experience.\n\nThe place was in dire need of renovations.\n\nThe rooms were ok, not really sparkling clean.  And the decor was 30 years out of date.\n\nPluses:  Likely the cheapest stay you can do while still staying ON STRIP in Las Vegas.\n\nThe ventilation in the casino is sub-par. Very smokey."
1,"I was overall pretty impressed by this hotel.  It's very chic and modern, perhaps a little too cold and uninviting, but nice.  The rooms were awesome!  Nice bed, wonderful view(one whole wall was basically a big window), bathroom was very nice.  You could open and close the curtains eith your tv and set your alarm that way as well as turn on/off all the lights.  Here are some downfalls: no cheap eats anywhere in it, check in/out took quite a bit of time, maid service did not come everyday.  We got a good rate on rooms so it was well worth it."
1,"I am in love with this place. I finally visited on a lazy, hot, and beautiful Sunday. I enjoyed the misters and breezes as I sat at the outside bar. The bartender Silk was amazing, attentive, and can make a delicious drink. The coronado drink which is a combination of cherry bourbon, elder flower, agave, and one other ingredient that I forgot, rocked my world. This was during happy hour and this delectable drink was only $5.00. \n\nI tried the goat cheese and bread, and fell in love with this dish after every bite.  Overall, this is a sexy, chic, and fun place to people watch, eat yummy food, and drink strong drinks!!!\n\nCheers"
0,"The food was okay nothing to write home about.  I should have read the post before comin. However, I was with another volunteer who wanted to eat here. The service was half ass.  I do not recommend this place."
0,"The restaurant was half full on a Saturday evening. There was Ennio alone in the kitchen and 1 waitress who had her hands full with only 20 customers in the restaurant. She would only appear and disappear once in a blue moon.\n\nWe waited 2 hours for our lukewarm meal. I don't understand why a plate of pasta and a green salad could take 2 hours to arrive and be lukewarm.The food tasted good but was traditional, not italian traditional but more like 1970 traditional. But we expected that.\n\nWe didn't expect my water glass to be chipped all over the rim, the water pitcher left on our table was dirty with fingerprints all around it like it hadn't been washed that day, the tablecloth was filthy from a few days ago, and the doily table runner contained an impressive collection of hidden breadcrumbs from several days back.\n\nWhen it was time to pay, and the waitress had disappeared, Ennio asked me if everything was okay. When I decided to say \""well, no\""  and politely explain why, starting with the fact that the food tasted good,  he clutched onto my Visa card and started arguing that my expectations were too high and that he was not running a 5-star restaurant, as if I didn't know that before walking through the door. I already expected the traditional food and the cheesy decor, the photos are on the internet. It can't be that difficult  to get hot pasta on a clean table.\n\nWhen I finally got my Visa card back, I smiled and told Ennio not to ask for our opinion if he didn't want it. As we were walking out, Ennio swore loudly at us. It was humiliating. The whole place heard. Terrible evening!"
0,"So I went there last night for a few beers and maybe some pizza. The pizza was decent, nothing special for sure. When I got my bill the waitress has added several drinks that I definitely did not order nor did I give anyone permission to add anything to my tab. Instead of realizing here mistake and removing the items that weren't mine she argued with me and it wasn't until I told her I was going to call the bank and disallow the charge that she finally removed the charges. I was a waitress for many years and understand that sometimes bills get mixed up but being that there were only about 8 people there there was really no excuse. I would never go there again the food is mediocre at best and the service is awful at best. Drive one mile up the road to Red, White and Brew if you are in the mood for great for including pizza and servers who are friendly and know what they are doing. If there was an option for 0 stars I would use that!"

0,"Ordered veggie lo mien w/extra veggies only to receive a greasy, bland dish with very little veg. Fianc\u00e9 ordered Singapore noodles only to get a mass of bland, boring noodles, without much meat or veg.  Egg roll, wonton soup and veg soup all equally under-whelming."

1,"My family and I enjoy eating at this restaurant.  The staff is always friendly, the food tastes great, and it's very clean.  My favorites are the Super Steak Pita, the Gyro, and the Combo Souvlaki.  Tastes very much like my families dishes from Greece.  As good as it gets when it comes to authentic!"
1,"Great pizza, nice crispy thin crust, great sauce best I have had since moving to the valley.  Service was also good will be back for more I highly recommend giving them a try."
0,"This is really one of the worst restaurants I have ever been to in Las Vegas.  \n\nI was really hungry and on a Sunday afternoon at Ceasers Palace food options are a bit limited because most restaurants close for the afternoon and reopen in the evening. \n\nSo I arrived and the hostess lady said all the tables are full and that I had to wait 10-20 minutes.  She then gave me one of those vibrating alarm things that would go off when a table becomes available and she was like, \""Make sure you stay within 10 ft, so we can reach you.\""  Not sure what the whole point of the alarm is if you can't walk father than 10 feet from the restaurant....\n\nAnyways, finally, after about 30 minutes of standing right next to the hostess, the alarm goes off and she guides me to a table in a clearly and completely EMPTY restaurant. I was a bit thrown off because it's just not nice to be lied to and certainly not nice to be kept waiting for no apparent reason.\n\nBy the time I sit down, I'm completely famished and order 2 dishes, one noodle broth and another scallops over noodles.  This is when the most ridiculous part happens...the food didn't come for another 45 minutes!  I'm not sure why it takes so long to make noodles in a completely empty restaurant.  Knowing that food options were a bit limited at the Caesars palace on a Sunday afternoon, I had no choice but to just sit there and wait.\n\nWhile waiting, I ordered a coke and no...it didn't come immediately, but after another 10 minutes.  When the waitress brought me the coke, it was a can and straw, and I had to ask her for a glass so I can pour it in. \n\nWhen the food came, the \""hot\"" noodles were cold (which is not surprising considering the 45 minute wait), and the \""scallops\"" were falling apart and in pieces.  I had always thought scallops are in round cylindrical shapes.  Not at this restaurant!  The minute you touch them, they fell apart, which was a bit disappointing but understandable as long as they taste good. \n\nUnfortunately, they did not taste good.  In fact, they tasted a bit foul...and let's just say I was a bit sick for the rest of the day and could barely leave my hotel room.  \n\nTwo noodle dishes and a coke, came to about $50-$60....and all this waiting just so I can spent an entire afternoon and evening food sick in my hotel room bathroom.  \n\nIt was so not worth it...."
0,"The interior of this restaurant doesn't look at all like I expected. No warm music, no tablecloths, no Italian paintings. In fact, it's pretty cold, a bit modern, and not all warm in the ambiance department. \n\nThe restaurant itself was empty besides the table by us, and the bar had several men sitting at it. Don't rush out and get your glam on,Girls, they're around my dearly-departed Dad's age\n. \nThe food? Very average. \n\nThe wine selection? Very small, and red's are not chilled to the temperature's that they should be. \n\nMy husband ordered the Shrimp Verde appetizer and the mussel's as his meal. \nI ordered the stuffed shells. \n\nMy stuffed shells were good, in and of themselves, but the vodka sauce was so salty that I am not swelling up and so thirsty that I am guzzling water. \n\nMy husbands shrimp verde was pretty good. Nothing offensive about them.\nThe mussel's were a little fishy, and although I generally love mussels, one was enough. \n\nThis place is quite a bit overpriced for what you get, in my opinion. \n\nIf you're an Italian, or an italian-food-lover, you may want to try somewhere else.."
1,"Wow! From the fried chicken, to the sides everything is homemade deliciousness, those corn meal flap jacks are awesome and don't leave with out some banana pudding.  We'll be back for sure."
1,"My doctor says I need more fiber in my diet, she says it's nature's broom. \nI say my diet is just fine, relying on the more traditional staples, such as pink snowballs, fritos, and beer.\nI tell her it's not not exactly nature's broom, but it is janitorial in a sense, almost like a mop and bucket. \n\nBut the 'roids need to go or else there'll be an operation she says...one nvolving hot pokers and way too much probing for my liking.\nThis is where CFA comes in handy.\n\nThey have a cole-slaw that's to die for, one guaranteed to promote a healthy colon,\nor at best, keep my proctologist's hands (and hot intruments) away from my precious bum, which has yet to break it's maiden with a hot poker or inquisitive finger.\n\nSo if you like cole slaw, and your doctor orders you to eat fiber, this is the answer to your... prayers?\nYou'll be crapping like a sick barnyard animal in no time.\n\nGo CFA cole slaw!!!\n\nWoo Woo, [fist pump]"
0,"This restaurant was terrible from start to finish. The decor is cool BUT the tables for two are way too close together and there are a bunch of big tables in the middle that are not being used. \nThe drinks were awful - no creativity at all, especially for an $18 martini. \nThe food was barely edible. I ordered the white bean soup which was bland. The egg roll that accompanied it was so greasy and I couldn't taste the veggies inside. My husband's filet was undercooked. The gnocchi was mushy and tasteless. We opted out of dessert. They gave us a little freebie which was a homemade Madeline with Nutella dipping sauce. Not exciting or gourmet at all.\nWhat a disappointing meal!!!"
0,"In terms of the hotel itself, I found it to be great and would give you 5 stars if it had not been for the unacceptable behavior of one of your staff. On the last day of my stay, my experience was marred by the disrespectful treatment of one of your employees.\n\nOn Monday July 14th, at 6am, I was waiting for my parents by the entry stairs. I had my luggage so I was clearly a patron at your hotel. I asked one of your young male employees where the restrooms were. I was told very rudely that I could go use the ones across the street and that I would have to wait outside. I informed him I was waiting for my parents. He then went into the vestibule and rudely told some Asian women that they'd have to go wait outside.\n\nSome Caucasian people then approached him with a question and I heard a different and courteous tone when he assisted them. \n\nI then asked him if there were restrooms on the 2nd floor and he reluctantly said yes. Why did he not tell me so in the first place? I felt discriminated against. I am paying for your hospitality, why should I have to go across the street to use the restrooms? I felt so humiliated and appalled that I did not think to ask for his name, which I regret. He is lucky I had to leave, otherwise I would have spoken to the manager about his racist attitude. His behavior was completely unacceptable, especially considering he is working in Chinatown."
1,"Fun, warm, lively catacomb place, often with piano music. Food is always really good. I want to hang out here more."
1,"Now the reason why Hulas doesnt have a higher rating is beyond me. This place is amazing and seriously they have a hard clientele to deal with. The food is amazing and you get to dine in a upscale hipster spot for a decent price. \nThe fish is always fresh and I recommend the butterfish with the coconut crust its sweet and buttery and amazing. I'm also a huge fan of the wasabi mashed potatoes. I have never had a problem with the freshness or qualitly with my burgers or steak either and they have ALWAYS been cooked to my liking as I find that alot of resturants in Phoenix will scorch the heck out of a piece of beef and then you get this black piece of grizzle and Hulas doesn't do that.\n\nAhh..the drinks..strong delicious cheap big. If you go with friends get the scorpion bowl its a huge bowl of liquory goodness that comes flaming with these huge straws to drink out of. The pink bikkini Martini tastes like a watermelon Jolly rancher too and its awesome. \n\nThe waitstaff is amazing too ask for Tia and you won't be disspointed. She IS the best server and guarenteed to please, and Selena and Ron at the bar will keep you entertained and happy for hours. \n\nOk now seriously 2 stars for syrup???? Are you kidding me??? Comparing crab to syrup? I have had the syrup and its awesome its REAL maple syrup and its maple and buttery so settle down and relax. If you THAT fanatic and hung up about syrup and its flavor why dont you go to IHOP on a Sunday morning and get yourself some Boisenberry and leave the good people at Hulas alone."
0,Paris hotel has a somewhat okay feel to it though I have experienced a much better time at other hotel and casino on the strip. The wifi charge is ridiculous. Purchased the king suite and it is super small on the 12th floor with a crummy view of a bally's alleyway. The noise on this side of the building are very loud on the weekend after hours due to the drai's rooftop club boom bass echoing through the buildings room adjacent to the Paris hotel on this side. The main pro to this Paris hotel is the location it sits on the strip.
1,"Yeah, it's all that...worth the drive, worth the calories. My advice: stop at one - any increment beyond that will surely not end well. We called ahead to make sure they still had cupcakes. They advised us they were going quickly and offered to reserve some. Boy am I glad we did! When we pulled up about an hour after calling (5ish), they had closed because they were out of cupcakes. However, ours were boxed and ready to go. The red velvet was excellent, perfect cream cheese frosting - not too sweet and no trace of crisco anywhere. (I'm for Team Butter).  Good thing I don't live closer."
1,"Tiestooooo's Club Life!\n\nI came here last weekend to see Tiesto like many of the other Yelpers here.  I was blown away by the entire show and I couldn't have asked for a better night.  I was with a great group of friends and the music made us all feel the love that night.\n\nI had no problems with will call and waited in a 2 minute line to get my ticket.  It was actually a really relaxing concert entrance compared to other concerts that I have been to at places like Staples or the Honda Center.\n\nThe Joint was spacious: large without being ginormous.  When we walked in around midnight the intro dj was still spinning.  While waiting for Tiesto, I was able to get a good feel for the place.  The stage is larger than you would think could fit into the Hard Rock's tiny casino.  The two floors above the main floor were way up!  I was on the main floor and I almost forgot that the second and third were above us.  No claustrophobia here.  All of the lights, streamers, confetti, and tiny birds that fell from the ceiling made the show even better.  \n\nThe only downside of the night is that water cost $15 a bottle.  It is pretty hard to not get thirsty at a 4 hour show, where you are jumping and fist pumping the whole time.  But what can you say... water is ridiculous at all clubs in Vegas\n\nThe Joint was a great venue to host Tiesto's Las Vegas residency.  If I could I would come again in a heartbeat.  Surrender to the sound...\n\n*Highlight of the night: Escape me"
1,"My boyfriend took me here because I LOVE wildlife. My family calls me a hippy/eco warrior. Anyways, the charge was 18 dollars a piece which was fine... I realize they have animals to take care of. They take pictures of you when you come in that they try to sell to you for Disneyland-type pricing, but we passed on that offer. Anyways, the aquarium is set up by station... you get a hand held device that you put to your ear to listen to each exhibit explanation. I really loved getting to see the animals up close, they are sooo beautiful. Towards the end there is a room you can pet sting rays and other small creatures. Beyond that is the huge room with all the big sharks and sea turtles! I was so excited to see all of them. We must have stayed in that room forever!! I totally recommend going here while you are in vegas to escape the smoke for a while and learn about sea creatures. I plan on going back next time I'm there."
0,"If you want mediocre food in a very slow -- actually dead -- atmosphere where you could sit at your  table and watch the staff as they watched soccer - do I have a recommendation for you.\n\nOk, it was not like I was the only person there.  In fairness, there were exactly two other people, one of which had come with me.  I had to do a double take as we walked to the front door  to make sure it was even open.  But I'm ok with undiscovered gems.  This one is definitely a diamond in the rough.  Just a tad bit more like cubic zirconium in the rough.\n\nThe menu is.. meh.  Adequate would be an overstatement.  We tried the bruschetta which wasn't half bad.  If you are wondering where the phrase skinny Italian comes from, though, you'll know it by the portion sizes.  Three bruschetta (bruschettae?) exactly.  What I did get to sample was pretty good.\n\nOn to the main course, I ordered the jalapeno pizza based on someone's review here earlier.  Can't say that I will ever be that brave again.  The dough was severely under cooked to the point of the crust to be deemed officially MIA.\n\nThe waiter, single employee in the joint, was pleasant enough so no qualms there.  I just really do not know how he can make any sort of living given the amount of traffic he was getting.  Poor guy, if you go tip him generously.  Or don't, because I half suspect he is the owner and couldn't get anyone else to cover such a dead shift.\n\nIf you are interested in Skinny Italian Kitchen, go there now.  I don't know how much longer it can last."
1,I hate going to the dentist! I didn't hate it this time. It was clean and professional. They explained the procedures very thoroughly. The hygienist that cleaned my teeth was awesome and deserves a raise! ;) The dentist was friendly and seemed to truly care.
1,Definitely a good breakfast spot. Service was on par and prompt. Nicole (our server) recommended the pancakes. It was a power breakfast. Good cure for my hangover. Coffee was good. Not Starbucks though. I thought the decor was a little dated. But it was clean though. I'd try them again.
0,"I officially have Lowe's on my NO list.  I went there today to look for a specific type of garden nozzle.  I didn't see it, so I described it to the clerk that offered help. \""Oh we don't sell those anymore, we have these nice adjustable gun style nozzles\""  Exactly what I did not want.  So  I put everything back and headed a mile down to the road to Home Depot.  YES they had it plus the other items that I needed.  \nOver the past three years, I have made many purchases for my house, and Lowes is the closest, but it always means leaving and continuing on to Home Depot.  I just wish the two stores were in each others place."
0,"Not what to expect for a lounge/club in one of the largest hotels in Vegas. PH should invest in a much bigger venue to accommodate its guest. Staff was terrible and rude. They act like they own the place or they think its the Marquee. Wasn't impressed by the service either. Bar tenders are very very rude, well, you don't get tipped that way, or maybe I will never go back there. The place is so tiny which you feel you are running out of O2. Better yet, they have host at every corner of the casino trying to recruit people with rest band claiming a VIP treatment, once you hit the door, you find out that its all a HOAX. Bad marketing strategy."
0,"Although the masseuse was very good at the spa the facilities were not clean! The service was less than average and unfriendly wait staff and overpriced for what I received. The receptionist upon arrival was grumpy and I have been to other spas in Vegas that were very well kept and concerned about me as their customer, in this facility I never even saw an employee other than when I was having my massage. They had a shower that was out of order as well as the steam room was closed. The hot tub was very dirty, the showers were old and rundown the vanity area was lacking and what was so called the couples grand room was very small and the jetted tub was very dirty I am very disappointed having been to a Mandara spa before I expected better."
1,"Hands down, the best spa in Vegas. I came in here for some R & R until I saw the gym. Then I decided I wanted to get all pumped up. The equipment is nice and clean. The gym doesn't smell like an abundance of sweaty men. I had a great 2 hour work out. I made my muscles work till they were sore and I felt like I was gonna puke. \nThe spa area itself, you can get a multitude of things from a waxing, baths, wraps, mud baths, facials. Really it's full service. The steam room has scents of Eucalyptus, and the sauna smells like fresh cedar. The whirlpools are so relaxing. Even the water....there's cucumber water or Lemon Water. Everything was so refreshing. Fresh muffins,  selection of teas. You get a bathrobe, slippers, and a bunch of magazines from Time, Maxim, Men's health, etc. Yea I was in the men's side, so i couldn't tell you what's in the women's!\nBut I have this plan to dress like a girl and infiltrate it. I just need to keep working out here to get into a size 2. \nDefinitely a great place to go to relax. If you don't get a treatment. Admission is 30 bucks and it's all day. That means when you get done with your workout in the morning, come back at night so you can get another workout and a relax hit again."
1,"Most cheap, fast-food burgers are glorified slop. \nMost sit-down \""fancy\"" burgers are terribly over-priced. \nWouldn't it be great to get a GREAT burger AND a GREAT price!?\n\nHabit.\n\nThis place never disappoints. The burgers are fresh, flavorful and made to order in an open kitchen.. The fries are cooked to a perfect crisp. The interior of the restaurant is neat, clean and welcoming. The staff is friendly. There are even menu items that cater to the non-carnivores out there.\n\nAll-in-all, it's great burger, a very reasonable price, and a super way to spend your lunch hour."
1,"I realize Great Harvest is a franchise, but this location has the best couple that run the store, that it's head and shoulders above the others that I have been to.  The breads are so yummy - the spinach feta is my favorite, closely followed by the savory loaf.  My daughter went nuts for the apple crumble.\n\nThis was my go-to sandwich place when I worked nearby, and I never got tired of it.  The sandwiches are so fresh and customized to exaclty what the customer wants.  And one cannot forget the sweets - the oatmeal chocolate chip cookies are fantastic, as is the chocolate chip scone."
0,"I can appreciate how difficult it must be to create a menu but this place needs to work a little harder. Went here with 9 others and only 2 of the entrees and one side was average or above. The other 7 entrees and multiple sides didn't get finished. Too many other, better places in Vegas. Don't waste your time on this, hoping you pick one of the acceptable meals. They get one star for effort, and that's being generous."
1,"Sprouts is one of my favorite stores! I feel healthier just stepping in there. I love their selection of fish, meats, and of course the produce. The employees are very nice and always willing to help you out. \n\nSprouts is one of my go-to stores, along with Fresh-N-Easy!"
0,Our room was nice & clean.  The bed was comfortable.  The breakfast buffet was good.  The staff was friendly.\n\nBut man are those walls thin.  Heard every bit of conversation as the people next door partied late into the night and then one of them dropping a deuce the next morning.
1,"We got Bottle Service here at Surrender. The service is great! They bring out the Grey Goose bottle in it's own type of jacket.\n\nI will admit that this venue is similar to XS, but significantly smaller and not as \""hip.\"" However, the lines aren't as drastic and it's a decent alternative to going to XS. It's got a huge pool, decent music, and very good looking people. The dance floor, unfortunately, is rather small.\n\nOverall: I would still go to XS over Surrender. If you can't get into XS, you can go to Surrender."
0,"We've had so many red flags after 6 months of prenatal care we're switching to another group before we give birth and something REALLY wrong occurs.  \nThe nurses are RUDE - I've interacted with 6 of them, four were just awful!  One nurse (in her mid-50s) actually forgot to turn the fetal heart rate monitor on and said, \""That's funny, I don't hear a thing\"".  OMG, what  moron!  I had to tell her to turn on the machine. \nAnother nurse recently told me I've gained too much weight - I've gained 23 lbs and I'm 31 weeks pregnant! ??? She later came back and indicated she was incorrect, but why would she say that??? \nOur OB is nice, but she's transferring out of the group soon.  \nThere seems to be a lot of drama, I really DO NOT recommend going there."
0,"This use to known as the former \"" View Bar \"" which was awesome! !! It was actually one of our must visit bars every time we would be out in Vegas. Not anymore. \n\nThe replace is now Lobby Bar. This place was very disappointing. We walked in at about 10 pm on a Friday night. Not many people there at all. We walked past 2 waitresses who were just hanging out talking. We sat ourselves at the end of the lounge facing the Aria lobby entrance so we can people watch and enjoy the lounge. We sat there for 20 minutes and no one even bothered to approach us and take our order. The drinks are also different now as well as the employees. No familiar faces at all. Looks like everyone jumped ship when this became Lobby Bar and I don't blame them. Bring View Bar back and the great service with the great drink menu. We would be back. But until then, we will continue walking past Lobby Bar onto the following bar that sits in the casino with live music. View bar was great. Had the piano player and relaxing atmosphere."
0,"There's a waitress there who's shady as fuck. We paid tax and tip, then she claimed we didn't and made us pay for tax again. We were too tired to fight it even more than we did so we just paid. Such a shame bc I really liked this place but don't like to be treated like shiiiiiiiiit"
0,"Disappointing! WAY OVER PRICED for less than average sushi. They try to be too fancy with their roll by smothering them in nuts, fruits, and other things! Some of the combos are just gross! For example, my roll was suppose to have fresh tuna on it but it looked like they had mashed the tuna up and molded it like catnip on top of my roll! Then, our seared tuna was completely covered with huge chunks of cracked pepper and sesame seeds...that's all you could even taste! Nothing was impressive. For a $90 tab, I was hoping for at least average!"
1,"Visited in July 2013 for my Bachelorette party. Stayed in a Royal Tahitian Suite. It was simple huge and comfortable, and clean, and fresh. It was awesome. HUGE. Its like having a 3 bedroom suite. \nThe jetted tub fit 3 of us girls in it lol.\nThe steam shower was cool. \nThe kitchen and kitchenette have nice cabinets and appliances. \nThe pools are great. The lazy river was so relaxing. Don't like that you cant bring your own red cup. \nThere was a DJ during the day on Saturday. Had so much fun!!\n\nDidn't take the shuttle; drove our own SUV packed with girls. Its not that far from the strip. Literally like a 1-2 minute drive to the strip. There is free parking everywhere so its easy to drive to a club, and if there is no DD by the end of the night, then we take a cab back to the hotel. And then the shuttle the next day to pick up the car. haha. \n\nCant wait to be back next summer!!"
1,"One of the superior hotels in Las Vegas!\n\nA very luxury hotel that meets all expectations. No need to write everything I want to praise, because it is certainly well known.\n\nI can only complain about one little thing: The windows do not open. Not even a small gap, as usual."
0,"We have gone to this Pizza Hut in the past and were not satisfied with the service. When we first moved to our house, this location and the one at Lawyers & Margaret Wallace both argued as to which location was supposed to deliver to us! We didn't feel like leaving the house last night and decided to give them another chance. They were 20 minutes late, the pizza and wings were cold, and the customer service was terrible! I will not be ordering from this place again. I am really surprised this location has been in business as long as it has."
0,"THIS IS YOUR WARNING!!!!!!!\nAlso mike and craig both work for this place.I never write reviews but I felt like this was necessary after all the trouble I had.\n\nI lived in a 600 sq ft renovated 1 bedroom. Yes the redesign in the apartment is nice, but don't be fooled. Everything, and I mean everything is cheap. Before I even used the dishwasher, it was broken and I had to have someone come and fix it. Everything in the apartment looked like the workers didn't care for detail. Paint lines uneven and on door knobs, old nails left in wall, uneven colored concrete floors and borders, half hanging on popcorn ceilings.. Everything is cheap and was done poorly. Once I had a friend over and we were just sitting on the couch and water started leaking from the ceiling!! I ran and got the worker guy and when we came back it had stopped so he didn't even try to find out what was the issue so it happened again of course. Also I did not appreciate the water being shut off all the time, most of the time with no prior notice until of course I complained.\n Neighbors and construction are constantly noisy and the smell of weed never leaves the building. Since it is a central air system, your whole apartment will smell of whatever the other apartments are cooking or smoking. Not one tenant besides me cared about how the place looked. After they got mail they would just through their junk mail on the floor instead of taking it back to their apartments. Along with any other garbage including alcohol bottles, syringes, and cigs. I would be so embarrassed of the place before friends came to visit that I would actually go pick up the junk mail off the floor. I paid $800 a month to basically put up with a terrible apartment.\nI started to notice roaches everywhere. In previous reviews before the renovation, this was a huge problem. So I went to the front office and they assured me they would come on Tuesday and I approved for that Tuesday. So I took the whole day of work off Tuesday and no one ever showed up. I come back to my apartment one day and what do I find? A notice saying them entered my apartment and sprayed! I did not approve that day and just because they missed the first one does not mean that they can just waltz in without a 24 hour notice! Once again, illegal. So I went and talked to the front office and they made it seem like it was my fault and I argued with the fact of what if I was sleeping or showering and they just entered and their response was \""OH THEY DO IT ALL THE TIME WHEN PEOPLE ARE SLEEPING PASSED OUT FROM PARTYING THE NIGHT BEFORE\"", but whatever it was settled and that was supposed to be the end of it. Come the next week I was actually in the shower when I hear my front door open. LETS KEEP IN MIND THAT I AM AN 19 YEAR OLD GIRL WHO LIVES BY HERSELF. So I begin screaming \""please do not enter!!! Please!!!\"" and they left. Once again I returned to the office where they assured me \""oh we're sorry it wont happen again\"".\n In the month of June, the AC went out. I was forced to go live back with my parents since the heat was unbearable. There was no thermostat so I bought an indoor thermometer to see exactly how hot it was. Most of the time it read anywhere from 88-92!!! I have photos and videos to document the whole time the AC was out and how poorly it was handled. At first they promised to have it fixed in a matter of days. I called on the day they promised and they just said \""I honestly don't know when it will be fixed\"". So I would call back a few days later. And got the same \""I honestly don't know, I honestly don't know\"". Calling every few days turned to every single day as I was becoming impatient. This went on for a little over 3 weeks. AZ law states that they have 5 days to fix my AC or else I can go live in a hotel and they would have to pay for it or I could have it fixed personally and bill them. Thankfully, I had my parents house to stay at so I decided to not go to those measures. It came to the point where I would call and say \""let me guess you HONESTLY DON'T KNOW?\"" and of course I was right. Finally, end of June I went to check on my apartment and it was finally fixed that very day. I was obviously upset and entirely fed up with the place that they let me end my lease early. So I moved out and the trouble stopped there right? WRONG! \nSo I passed the security deposit check since I took great care of my place and I waited to receive my check in 3 days. Those days passed and nothing so I decided to give them to the end of the week, still nothing! So I called and once again they entire terrible staff had \""no clue\"" so I was told they would get it settled.So I had to drive all the way over to their office to pick it up. I get there still no check. Of course she goes \"" uh we sent it out lemme check\"" as she goes to just move around her mouse and not even check any sort of document, \""we'll send it out again I swear!\"". So more waiting until it reached a month. went back and demanded the check."
1,"Like other reviewers, we called and emailed more than 10 companies looking for landscape maintenance quotes with only a handful responding and even fewer coming out to look at our lot.  Adrian called us back and came out to check out our lot on the same day I called.  He was prepared to work that afternoon, but we had him come back a couple days later.  We have several large trees (including a queen palm) and bushes with about a year's worth of growth.  Needless to say, our yard was very overgrown.   \n\nUltimately, Adrian's quote beat the other estimates by a landslide, and the final product was above and beyond what we were expecting.  He was responsive and fast.  We plan to call him for all of our future landscape maintenance needs."
1,Great service. Would recommend to all my friends to come here. Josh is highest rated on yelp for a good reason. Im very pleased with what I payed for the amount of work that was done. Super stoked to find a trusty mechanic nearby who knows his stuff.\n\nThanks again guys
0,I'm an avid sushi eater and this place is a hole in the wall that you DO NOT want to spend your money on. Got the all you can eat for an hour. The waitress was an older Filipino lady who seemed really bothered to take our order. She came around twice and we never saw her again. We couldn't even utilize the all you can eat because no one was around and we weren't the only ones complaining that night.We said f-it and left. Went to complain and the guy that took our money couldn't speak English. There are way better sushi spots in Vegas. Don't waste your time here.
1,"Convenient place for quality pasta.  I had a custom order of whole wheat penne pasta, with marinas sauce, shrimp, roasted garlic and tomatoes.  Good weight watchers meal."
1,"Dr. Sotelo is a Buckeye's fan, how can you go wrong here?  \n\nBeside being from the same area in the Midwest as Dr. Sotelo I have been taking our children here for several years.  We have always been treated well by the staff and Dr. Sotelo.  There is hardly any issues with scheduling an appointment and they don't make you wait forever in the waiting room or the exam room.\n\nI saw Dr. Cannon for the firstime on my last visit there and was pleased with his evaluation and treatment of my daughters issues."
1,"Yum, yum, yummy.  You'll want to check these folks out!  They have been on Groupon a few times and you get lots of food for the money.  Really, if there were such a thing as a 'to go' bag for breakfast, you'll need it.  Great tasting skillets, wonderful hamburgers and a genuinely friendly, helpful staff. They made us feel at home and that's every time (have been there three times) we've gone.  They don't get upset about Groupon and stop to chat if you're willing.  This place reminds me of what diners used to be.  Try it!"
0,"Took the family to this particular Red Lobster for my oldest son's birthday (he wanted Red Lobster).  We usually go to the S. Alma School location, but decided to try this one.  Big mistake!  We entered and the hostess was not very friendly, and was rolling her eyes about something when we greeted her.  We waited the 15-20 mins to be seated, no biggy.  We get seated and the waitress comes by for our drink order.  We get drinks and take a few to decide our order, and this is when the fun started.  The waitress never mentions specials, etc so as we order I ask for a particular item that she states is popular and that is why they're out of it.  I make a choice on something else, but this could have been avoided by a simple explanation of specials and a \""by the way, we are out of this\""  So we get our slads and biscuits and it seemed to be ok.  Now our order arrives, me and my sons get our orders, my wife gets a portion of what is supposed to be served as an entree in appetizer form.  The waitress explains here are these shrimps, the grilled take longer, it's my fault but it should be up in 2 minutes.  Ok, 10 minutes later, the grilled shrmp skewer is brought out, no sides that are supposed to be with them.  The waitress asks did you want me to bring those out?  Really?  With a little bit of an attitude I might add.  My wife then asks to speak to  a manager.  He comes over about 5-7 minutes later, which makes me think he may have over camplaints.  He was very nice and comped her meal and my son's dessert.  The 2 stars are for him making her order right,  It will be a long time, if ever we go back there due to some piss poor attitudes by people that should be working in a toll booth rather than dealing in the service industry."
1,"Got a nice little tattoo from Jesse. He did an excellent job AND charged a little amount! Everything in the shop is really clean, and they take pride in their work. I am super stoked on my tattoo, and If I lived here I would definitely be going back!"
0,"I've gone here about once or twice a year for about 7 years.  The girls are great, but I was just there last weekend and while I was fine with $100 for a private dance, I was shocked by the $46 price tag for two drinks.  I might show up again in the future if I'm dragged there, but I'm definitely never getting a private ever again."
0,"Wow.. All I can say is pubes in my baked potato.. \n\nWe came to Dillon's after we went to zoo. We had the Groupon deal and on the deal it says one Groupon per transaction. I called a ahead of time to make sure I could do separate checks for me and my wife. \n\nAnyway, we get to our table and the kids are tired and ornery. We tell the waitress we will do four separate checks between us and our friends. The waitress seemed annoyed.. We tried to be quick with ordering and knowing what we wanted. Apparently we were not nice enough because like I said earlier.. I got pubes in my food. \n\nThe manager came over and offered to make me a new plate.. Really?? I just got pubes in my food. No thanks! \n\nHe offered nothing else besides that. \n\nI am disgusted with this place and would advise you to stay away..\n\nThis is at a Zoo.. Expect ornery kids. I called ahead and asked about the Groupon deal.. The customer service there does not exist!\n\nI am still sick to my stomach thinking about this.."
1,"I found this place through yelp reviews and it did not disappoint. Overall, the service was decent and the food was great.  We'll definitely be back again for the food. Our waitress wasn't too attentive to us once the food came out since we ran out of coffee half way through the meal.  She may have been new since she had to come back and ask my friend how she wanted her eggs on a breakfast sandwich and when asked which menu item was better she was unsure what to recommend and she seem a little unorganized with the checking out process (ie took my friend's check who paid cash and didn't bring back the change until asked, etc)."
1,"pinkies up!\n\nNothing makes me feel like a fancy shmancy lady like having high tea, and Le Maitre Chocolatier knows how to do it just right. \n\nComing in for 4pm reservations, almost all tables were full of ladies (and a few gentlemen) of all ages, sipping on hot tea and relaxing in the cozy tea room. Opposed to other tea houses I have been to, this one had a more modern feel, not packed with antiques, lace and frills like one might expect. It was just the right setting, not one where you feel as though you have to whisper or like you might get in trouble for touching something valuable. \n\nThe high tea starts off by picking your brew and they have quite an extensive collection! The best part is that they give you a tray of individual tins which house a tea bag, allowing you to smell all the varieties to best pick your favorite tea. No picking from a menu here!  \n\nThe waitress, who was serving the entire room but paying great attention to each table, recommended that my friend and I start off with one pot, which was my choice of a peach apricot blend, and then brew my friend's English breakfast pick when the first pot was done. We never made it to the second pot though, even after plenty of refills for the both of us, so if you are set on having your choice of tea, I would say ask for both pots from the get go.\n\nAfter the tea is served and you have a bit to sip and enjoy, the yummy petite food is served up beautifully and our waitress explained that what we were about to indulge on was typical English high tea fare, with some french twists, such as the Foie gras. The bottom tray had 4 cucumber sandwiches, 2 polenta, 2 smoked duck meat sandwiches, 4 egg salad sanwiches and 2 Foie gras on crackers. Might I add these are mini sandwiches, not full size. The second tier held delicious rasin scones and a variety of cream/ jams. The top of the platter held decadent chocolates and petite desserts. \n\nEverything I ate was delicate and delicious and the desserts rich. The services was leisurely, as is the nature of high tea.\n\nA very nice afternoon activity and highly recommended."
1,Visited this location when I was roaming around Cesar's Palace.  The pastries were very appealing and they taste good too.  Has a huge pastry selection.  They serve lunch items as well.  \n\nI got the Berry Napoleon and pistachio cake.  I took it to go and they boxed it in a clear plastic box.  It was busy when I visited this place.  It is expected since there are heavy traffic in Cesar's Palace.  I personally feel this place is a bit better than Buchon's Bakery.  \n\nGreat place to stop by for amazing desserts.  Highly recommended.\n\nBon Apettit!
1,"We used the basic cleaning service. Their website clearly details the prices and the services provided, which is very good . The cleaner Cesar and his assistant were very professional and diligent. They did a great job. My house looks really tidy and clean :)"
0,"I've tried everything in the store so far so this hopefully can give you an honest review about what I've thought. (all in my opinion)\n\nBath Salts - tubes are too small to really feel any sort of difference in the bath, and the scent wont be noticeable once you are soaking. \n\nSoaps - I have found no luck with ANY of their facial soaps. All of them do the same thing - dry out my skin. All of the Glycerin soaps smell great in the store, but once used, there is no scent and they are very drying. Lush's soaps BY FAR outshine Basin. No contest. Speaking of which, most soaps are claimed to be hand made by the company but I have seen many soaps sold by another company called Primal Elements. suspicious. plus, the soaps are cut super inconsistent. There's normally a salesperson at the front cutting fresh soaps but some soaps will be cut very big (costing almost $10 a soap) where as I've tried to pick up others and they are barely over $4 and there are no bigger pieces to select from. Their signs say $5.99 and very small say per 100 g but I figure if your sign sys 5.99 thats the price your products should be. \n\nAll Bath Extras (ie massagers, bath pillows, soap dishes etc.) - Def bought whole sale... Which is kind of a shame when the sales people tell you they are a family owned business, you expect homemade products to an extent.\n\nBath Bombs - Oils in them are DEF noticable in the tub, smells are great and come in a vast variety from light scents like Calm Waters and Twilight, to their heavily scented Sastuma and Hidden Treasures. Being a Lush user, which most people would find the store quite similar, I have to say I'm not impressed with the scents. The one thing that keeps me buying Lush is the lingering scents that I literally can smell in my bathroom for days after a soak. This being said I will continue to use Lush accompanied with some extra oils and I will easily have had a better product than Basins. Not Impressed. \n\nLip Scrub - I like this one better than other lip scrubs I have found. They seem to have more oils in them which helps to keep the product cleaner in application. However, for 8.99/each. I'll make my own. Here are the ingredients. Raw Sugar, Olive Oil, Avocado Butter, and Flavorings. Easily homemade for a heck of a lot cheaper. \n\nChapsticks - once again, definitely bought wholesale. Their lip balms (and i've bought a couple) are too glossy. I bought a lime one for a male friend of mine and he refused to use it. $5 lip balm, wasted. \n\nSolid Moisturizers - I'm gonna say, this really is one of their better products. BUT make sure you are getting the one with the TAMANU oil in it. The smaller ones they sell at their other stores do NOT have the tamanu oil in them and those products seem lack luster. Wish they had better scents in this product though, being as their are only four. Almond Coconut is what I bought (and two actually because of the $4 discount you get) and it smells NOTHING like almond coconut. Sickeningly sweet, and to think I spent $30 for two. If you like the scents get it.... if not, dont get conned. \n\nSpa Wax - 32$!!!!!! WAY overpriced for only being Soy bean oil and Avocado Butter. Product works great though, I will admit. One winter I had EXTREMELY dry and itchy skin... one night I heated the little guy up and rubbed it on my skin... the next day my skin was soft and smooth.. BUT.... i haven't used it since.. that was 8 months ago.. I havent necessarily had a need for it. \n\nBody Butters - Love them. They melt in the summer, but throw them in the fridge for a cpl hours and they are back to the great consistency. VERY EXPENSIVE. $18 each... but I always buy more... \n\nShampoo and Conditioner Bars - Conditioner bars are an absolute waste. Don't bother spending the $8 for one... they do nothing for your hair. But the Shampoo Bars are another story. The only one I have found luck with is the Iced Cherries. other ones just seem to be very drying and not as desirable... plus the iced cherries smells absolutely divine. \n\nMositurizers, Showers Gels, and \""Foaming\"" Baths - Honestly the Shower Gels and Foaming baths feel like the same product with just a different name. Sad. Mositurizers are HIGHLY overpriced. $17 and barely 8 oz. Not worth it... not in the least. \n\nMilk Baths - GREAT product. Another very expensive thing for only a Bubble Bath ($20) and its always a hit or miss getting it in the store. Sales people always say 'one of the ingredients is on back order' or something like that, but it seems like they just don't know how to order enough to keep the store stocked. this has happened to me on 3 separate visits. \n\nBody Scrub - best product in the store but WAY too big. I always have to order off line cause I cannot take it in carry-on which ends up making the product cost more. major bummer... but it always seems worth the buy. this is my regular buy on my visits."
0,"I guess I'm just spoiled from living in New Mexico my whole life (best mexican food EVER).  This place had been recommended to me by pretty much everyone when I told them I was looking for NM style Mexican food. We finally made it here & I was stoked! The girl behind the counter kept answering the phone while we were ordering, another worker was walking past us cursing at another employee...awwwwwkward. Now I'm willing to look past all of that IF the food is good, sadly disappointed doesn't even begin to cover it.  \n\nI ordered a carne asada chimichanga & my husband ordered the chorizo & potato combo plate.  The food came out quickly & my husband couldn't figure out what he was looking at on his plate.  It was just ground beef on top of mashed potatoes. Every place he's ever been has served it with fried potatoes & actual chorizo. Is this normal for AZ?  He didn't even want to eat it the food was so bland. I cut into my chimi & couldn't believe the meat that was coming out of it...boiled dry hamburger meat.  This was absolutely not carne asada. I gave it a shot thinking that at least if it's flavorful it won't matter. Nope. Bland, dry absolutely NO flavor. The guacamole on top was great & the tortilla wasn't heavy from being fried, it was nice & light.  But what's a chimi without yummy fillings?! I couldn't even finish it, we both had weird artificial aftertastes in our mouths as we were leaving. Blech. Sorry, but this is a huge \""never again\"" for me."
0,"The Emperor's Buffet is really a joke. I had great company, but the service was horrible and the food was worse than the worst dining commons food at Cal...and that was bad.  The cashier was incredibly rude and the selection of food was severely lacking. The Imperial Palace is run down and the buffet is no different.  For the same price, you can get a better meal at Circus Circus."
1,"YES. Go here.\n\nFinally, an artisan coffee shop in Edinburgh that serves up SERIOUSLY GOOD coffee without taking itself too seriously. Just had the pleasure of visiting Brew Lab on its opening day; here are my thoughts:\n\nWhether you're a coffee enthusiast or just your run-of-the-mill caffeine addict, Brew Lab - with its brilliant periodic table style menu and unique brewing vessels - invites you to try new ways of drinking the beloved beverage. Filtered coffee, infused coffee or espresso from one of the three Slayer machines in the UK - you can try it all. \n\nSituated on the quiet, yet quite central, South College Street, Brew Lab offers a welcoming mix of modern design (i.e. the iPad till) and rustic comfort. It definitely feels like the type of coffee shop you could spend all day in. Loved it!"
1,"Great little sports bar just a couple blocks away. Large patio, lots of TV's. The pool and shuffleboard tables are a bit of a squeeze. The happy hour and reverse happy hour are very good and for can be a hit or miss. Usually the waitress will tell you if you as if something is good or not.... with an honest answer. This is a growing local chain and I've been to 3 of the locations which seem to be consistant."
1,"I love this place 4am-9am haha\nSo I tried it for dinner one night, and I was pleasantly surprised. It was delicious and really good quality. \n\n\nStill a great after hours dive feel"
0,"This was our third time visiting this Smashburger, each time has been a wait, but its new so its to be expected.\n\nTonight, we waited for 55 minutes to get our meal amongst screaming children and loud teenagers.  When our burgers finally arrived they were cold and dry.\n\nNever again will I eat here, in fact, if I could give this place less than 1 star I would."
1,"The Fillmore is a great music venue. Arrived right at 8 for an 8:00 show. Intro band on at 8:40 and the main act by 9:30. I was afraid we'd be too late for a good view, but we stood right at the barricade on the bar side of the stage. Awesome view and didn't even have to wait forever to get it. \n\nThe chandeliers are beautiful and make for an interesting venue. Note that (for us at least) it was standing room only. The drinks were ridiculously small for a large price ($9 I think for a 3\"" tall cup) but that is to be expected at a concert. Parking was no problem and right across the street from the Fillmore."
0,"Called in about 10:00 am for a breakfast burrito, and now at 5:00pm, I am still regretting it! It was the worst burrito ever!  I also got one for my son, and he agreed it was awful, he said it best, \""the best part of the burrito, was the end of it!  Since I was not able to finish my mine, because it was so bad,. I never did get to the best part!  WHAT A DISAPPOINTMENT.  SAVE YOUR $$ AND YOUR STOMACH THE PAIN ."
1,I'd been here a few times.  I love where it's located in the Madison Square.  I love eating and people watching.  The food is always great and the service is always topnotch.\n\nWe had the Sausage Pizza and the homemade spaghetti. It was one of the best I have ever had.
0,"I have come here for many years and have typically been pleased with the experience. In the past few months, something has changed.  The theaters have been filthy... trash bins overflowing on the floor.... the carpets dirty... the theaters mostly uncleaned between shows with food and wrappers on the floor... the concessions generally empty and in disarray.  Its unfortunate since it is so convenient.  I think in the future I will try other theaters."
0,"We turned to Greyhound to get from Phoenix to Tucson. We were going to rent a car, but picking up in Phoenix and dropping off in Tucson for 5 days was over $600 at one of the cheaper rental car agencies. That seemed crazy, so we bought one-way tickets on Greyhound for 3 passengers for about $40. \n\nWas there a better deal online? Interestingly enough, the internet special costs more. \n\nWould we save money on our tickets if we purchased ahead? No, but Mr. L bought our tickets a week ahead anyway, since the 2:30pm Sunday bus was the only time that actually worked for us. He printed out our tickets, which said we were confirmed. That Sunday would be Daylight Savings, but it was Arizona, which didn't have a time change.\n\nThat Sunday when we showed up at 2pm for our 2:30pm bus, we learned that they'd changed the time to 1:30pm. The Daylight Savings in other states affected the schedule. We should have confirmed our \""confirmed\"" tickets. The station agent changed us to a 5:30pm bus, and we were bummed that we'd have a few hours to kill and miss out on time with Mr. L's parents. And they'd have to find the bus station in the dark - shoot.\n\nLesson learned? Buying tickets ahead with Greyhound isn't the best idea. If you do, confirm them, as the schedule may change.\n\nWith hours to kill in the Greyhound Station, my son started playing video games at $1 a pop, and Mr. L and I gathered our thoughts. There was some scary looking food sitting under heat lamps in the Cactus Caf\u00e9. We rented two lockers to stow our luggage for $3 each for 3 hours and split in a cab for a while to go anywhere but the bus station.\n\nWhen we returned closer to our new departure time, the lines for the buses were confusing. The line for Tucson was not the line for our bus. It seemed like everything was backwards here. Luckily we asked, or we might've missed our bus again. By the time we boarded our bus, many seats were taken. Ichabod headed to the back of the bus, and a kind gentleman cleared the 3-seat rear spot for us. \n\nThere was a bathroom near the back, which Mr. L suggested I avoid entering. He said it was a basic hole (outhouse style) with an empty jar of hand-sanitizer. Good to have the bare-bones bathroom if you really need it, but ick.\n\nThe driver made a bunch of announcements in English, then in Spanish. He meant business. I was glad when he told passengers to use headsets for their music, since initially a nearby passenger graced us with his music. Now we only got to see his seated dance moves, which were actually pretty good. \n\n+2 affordable prices\n+2 capable driver\n-2 changing the schedule after had a \""confirmed\"" ticket\n-1 for only one agent working the line \n+2 having a bathroom on bus\n-1 condition of bathroom\n+1 lockers in Greyhound station\n-1 for the clusterf*ck of confusion of lines to get on buses - advanced degrees don't help here, be ready to ask questions\n\nGrand total: 2 stars\n\nOverall, we were glad not to spend over $600 on a rental car or inconvenience our friends or family by asking for a very long ride. We learned that we need to confirm or buy tickets last-minute like most Greyhound riders. Hanging out in a Greyhound station is not my idea of fun. We would ride Greyhound again, but proceed with caution."
1,"Great view, great service and great food!\n\nWe came here for my dad's birthday and fortunately for me I packed an evening dress and heels. Not so good for my dad lol. He forgot to bring a jacket and apparently this restaurant likes to keep that \""high class\"" feel going. They even lent him a jacket to wear for the entire dinner. I find that somewhat funny but at least they didn't turn him away right?\n\nLooking at the menu, it took me back when I was at the Space Needle for dinner. Everything sounded so amazing yet so pricey! I can admit it, I can be fairly cheap sometimes BUT I do however think amazing foods come at a fair price.\n\nWith that said.. I order the roasted rabbit, no appetizer or salad. They served us asparagus soup  and bread to begin with so I didn't want to stuff my face too much. Gotta save room for dessert! Having rabbit is new to me and as much as I wanted lamb I also like to try new things even more so. The meat was so delicate, much more so than lamb but just as delicious. With the sauce and vegetables served along the rabbit, everything fell into place. My mouth certainly was having a taste bud orgasm.\n\nFor dessert, I ordered the pistachio souffle which our server had informed us about in the beginning since it takes about 45 minutes to prepare. Souffle? Yum. Pistachio? YES PLEASE! So how was it you ask? Blissful. I was literally in heaven. Subtle sweet gooeyness and fluffiness... Oh, and it was humongous! I probably could have devoured it all by myself but I was nice enough to share since there was definitely more than enough.\n\nExceptional service of course. Our server was very friendly and informative. The ambiance is very intimate with an outstanding view of the water fountains at The Bellagio. It was a nice experience and worth it but man was I happy to take off my heels after wards! The strip is not friendly to feet in heels at all."
0,"The Luxor is probably one of the best looking hotels on the strip from the outside....  \n\nUnfortunately for me and others who stay here on there visit to Las Vegas this hotel is nothing more than the a 1or 2 star hotel, disguised as a 4 or 5 star hotel on the inside.  The room does not match the architecture, the elevator feels like a death trap, the decor is lame and outdated, and the housekeeping isn't the best.  \n\nIn fact, I ask the standard housekeeping immigrant guy you always see pushing the towel cart for some towels and he said \""No\"", I was shocked.  I decided to just go the other route, and just took some off the cart and kept it pushing without asking."
0,"Thank you for deleting my review because it shines the light on how terrible this hospital is, Luckily - I have it saved so I can paste it as many times as I'd like, and have shared with everyone I know to avoid this horrific establishment: \n\n\nAbsolute Garbage. Worst hospital I've ever witnessed in action.\n\nMy father fell and fractured his hip.\n\nDay 1:\nthey withold my father from eating as they say hes going to have surgery that day\nwe keep asking, nurses have no idea when he's having surgery\nlunch rolls around, dinner rolls around, still no food and still no surgery (He has low blood sugar, diabetes, and is 74)\nat night they say they realize it wouldn't be able to happen that day, tell him and ask if he wants dinner (which took another hour to be delivered to him).\nMy mom took off work, which cut into her schedule and really screwed us over.\n\nDay 2: surgery scheduled for 3 pm.\nmom gets off work early, we get here at 2 and wait. (Granted I have school, she took off more time for work, and my dad's going without food again)\n\n3 doctor rolls on in, states some genius had a hole in their glove and contaminated all the work equipment which would take an hour to fix. 4 pm rolls around. 5 pm rolls around. 6 pm rolls around. We ask every hour what in hell is going on, still receive no information - at 6, we finally learn that an emergency case came in and they used the room which they had prepped for my dad, and said it would be another 20 minutes.\n6:30 rolls around. they come in tell us another 20 minutes.\n7:15 rolls around. my dad is raging, and we're trying to calm him down but he hasn't eaten all day and is in a lot of pain - I don't blame him for being pissed at this horrendous system they call a hospital.\n7:30 rolls around and they finally get him in, but I forgot to mention the nurses who all gathered his information all went home (boy lucky them) so we got some potato head genius's who roll in asking all the same questions, which just makes this situation feel even more smooth.\nAll in all, this is the biggest joke of a hospital experience I've witnessed.\nIf I was there for the first day, I would have had him transferred to another hospital.\nSurprised my mother didn't. If I was there the first day, I would have probably exploded at the staff about how incompetent they were.\n\nwould not recommend anyone with a sick or injured family member to come here. we came here because it was closer, but next time will definitely tell ambulance or whoever to take the injured person out of their way to banner baywood or banner desert.\n\nPROS:\n- friendly nurse staff\n-clean environment\n-good hospital food\n\nCONS:\n-terrible communcation skills (Between staff and staff-to-patient)\n-horrible bedside manner in shift transition (potato heads waltz in asking redudant questions with a cheeky smile on their face when we've waitied for days and are irate beyond belief. how about some communication if you don't feel like getting yelled at).\n-awful time management and design scheme, how about we make patients wait for days when they have conditions that could put their life in danger if they don't eat.\n\nI would give this place a 0 for their service, and a negative score for trying to hide my review. Disgusting."
0,"The worst experience with this restaurant chain ever, management was not working with the host. A patron waiting behind me was attacking me on making a decision on whether I wanted to wait 90 mins to eat after the host asked me if I wanted to wait 15 seconds earlier. I came to Scottsdale to relax on vacation and left knowing people are so rude in this city."
0,"They are the worst EVER! They make you wait 1-3 hours every time to see the doctor. They have absolutely no respect for your time, they feel you are lucky to be seen by them and you should worship them. \n\nShow a little respect for other people's time, we have lives too and don't need to spend 1-3 hours each time waiting in your office. HORRIBLE!!!"
0,For Taiwanese style of breakfast.  The  seasamebaked bun is as hard as a stone.  Disappointed!
1,"First off I don't go here for gas... This station is usually way way more expensive then all the other gas stations... But its on the way home and it seems to be a safe location its always well lit and it seems to be a local gas stop for the cops from the station down the street. \n\nI come here for the \"" Beer Cavern \"" they have a huge selection of beer and they always have great deals and they are ice cold!  FYI they ALWAYS check IDs at this location. \n\nThey always have deals on their energy ... drinks ( my fav  Low Carb Monster  2  for 3 bucks ).\n\nThe customer service is always great... maybe cause I'm always here and they know me."

0,"Making a reservation well in advance, I expected great things from this restaurant with its tasty, rich dishes. Unfortunately, it was a bit of a let-down. Service was slow and poor; there were no apologies made by the server for her tardiness and she did not check in during our meal. It seems like she  focused all her attention on her other four tables, willfully ignoring ours. \n\nWith regard to the food, we ordered the duck in a can and the pied de cochon. The first dish had a juicy piece of duck meat hidden under lakes of oil and a solid piece of duck skin with unrendered fat, and of course the foie. I was not quite sure how to attack the fat so I just ate the meat. The pied de cochon was actually served in deep, large bowl - it was that large. It was nothing special, just heaps of food on a plate with little thought to presentation. I thought the pied was also undercooked as I had trouble getting through the tougher and thicker parts of the skin.\n\nAll in all, not so great."

1,"I read the reviews from prior people before writing this.  They must have stepped up their game, or the people writing them were diva's.  I've been through Vegas 40 or 50 times in the past 10 years and this is my first stay at the Hard Rock.  \n\nI won't stay anywhere else unless they give me a damn good reason to.  We stayed in the HRH tower, had the view of the planes taking off an landing, We had a King Suite for an Unbelievable price of $290 for 5 days.  The bed was UN-FRIGGING-BELIEABLE!!!  2 TV's, GREAT room service, Super cool staff except for a waiter in the Mr. Lucky's that I wanted to bitch slap.  Everyone else - regular folk who like to smile and make it happen for you.  My wife & I were not just a number.  \n\nIt was Mrs Caruso's first time in Vegas, so we went over to the strip, up to the old part of town, and just generally had a good time, but in spite of going through all the other casino's, we'd come back to the Hard Rock and look at each other as we walked in, and said \""\""home\"".  Because it was for us.  Christina, who was our 1am casino waitress seemed to intuitively know when to chat, when to stop by to check on us, and even refused a tip with a smile, saying she was ok.  Nicole, our Check out gal, was phenominal in making everything smooth and seemless for us.  Santo's, the Valet from Melbourne was a Great reference for my wife to help illustrate some of the differences between Vegas service, & Australian service (which is almost non-existant).  My wife, is also Australian, and we currently live in Brisbane.  \n\nIf you've made it this far in my review, you know the rest of the story.  We had a great time, it's a Great hotel, and it's made that way by the people that work there.  I highly recommend it here.  We won't be staying anywhere else."
0,"Screw this place.  I had a groupon for mani, pedi, and mini facial and I called to schedule it today (June 15) and she told me they are booked on weekends until August 6.

I don't gamble or anything like that, but I do frequent the movies here and, on occasion, the bowling alley. You can usually count on no crowds here. We walked up to Harry Potter 7.0 on opening night and got great seats for four."
1,"Quote to Finish - Great Job Jeff, Mike and Charles ! \nI'm getting ready for move out soon and needed the carpets professionally cleaned. Started searching yelp + google reviews and stumbled across J2. I can tell you reviews are accurate, service and results are great. Bypass the cheap, quickie carpet cleaners, spend a little extra and call these guys. Happy New Year J2"
1,"I was taken here by my Mexican friend, who claims this is one of two authentic Mexican restaurants in all of Vegas.  It's got a great ambiance, a live musician playing the keyboard to Mexico's greatest hits (judging by my pal's enthusiasm for the songs), and delicious food.  At one point, some people even got up to dance the bachata - winner, winner, chicken dinner.\n\nPros:\nDelicious food\n\""Mexican approved\"" (and I mean \""Mexican from Mexico City,\"" not, \""this one friend I have who is kind of tan and I think his last name is Garcia or something.\"")\nWell-decorated\nGood ambiance - great for groups or a romantic date - a rare combo!\nFriendly and prompt service\nThe dude playing the keyboard had a good voice.  (If you have to listen to live music, it had better be pleasant, that's all I'm saying!)\n\nCons:\nA little spend-y for a Mexican restaurant - I usually think of Mexican as cheap eats.\nA little loud for first-date or similar chit-chat.\nNo \""mild\"" salsa option at the table - I'd say it was medium, which is cool for me, but might not be everyone's bag.  Or bowl.  Or container of your choice.\n\n\n*A side note: The service was great, but they did forget to bring my side of guacamole, I forgot to mention the oversight, and when the bill came I forgot to check and see if I was charged for it - double fail on me!\n\nOverall, this place is a win, and I will totally go again."
0,"MWas in yesterday with Rosie for her routine vaccination. The receptionist was very cold and not hospitable. We arrived 20 min. early, yet still waited another 20 min. for her to get seen. Tech and Dr. where GREAT!!! Upon leaving and scheduling Rosie's surgery the same receptionist proceeded on giving us instructions for surgery appt.  With a harsh tone of voice reminded us about missed appointments!!! Yes I DID call and rescheduled 3 times due to death in the family. I'm very dissatisfied and disappointed this time. We will have Rosie's surgery there, but will not return to that location."
1,"So who would have guessed that July 4th weekend is the weekend where 10,000 Vietnamese people from all over the US gather to watch Paris By Night (a rip off of MTV's Music Awards in Vietnamese). Wrong weekend to crave Pho indeed because all the Pho places I'm familiar with in Vegas were jammed packed. \n\nThis place is the definition of hole in the wall. My kitchen in Vietnam was bigger than this place. But to find a nice diamond, you have to dig through all the coal. \n\nHands down the best Com Tam (broken rice bbq dishes) in Las Vegas. You want to stick with the pork chop. Moist, tender, smoky and beautifully charred marbling. The rice is soft and buttery. The egg rolls have this taro meat combination that is quintessentially Vietnam. \n\nThe Pho is definitely top notch. The slightly oily broth has this homemade feel to it that only people who have actually made Pho at home can understand. Fresh Pho will have these floating oil micelles because it hasn't been strained over and over and over like typical Pho places. This type of Pho will sing to some and scare others. I'm a native, so this type of Pho holds dear to my heart. \n\nConclusion:\nEverything is fresh and HOT! Yes HOT! I can't stress enough that temperature is key in Vietnamese cooking. Every dish that is cooked with fire needs to be served HOT! Steamy! This is the only place in Vegas that has that concept down. I just wish the decor is nicer; then I can bring my friends. \n\nnext visit - order Bun Bo Hue (Spicy Noodle Soup)."

0,We had drinks there the other night and I was disappointed. It seems the place has gotten just a little bit full of itself. The bartenders were actually walking with their tennis shoes where they stack the fresh glasses. The bottles were high up and they had no ladder.  Disgusting.  Also my martini was finished and empty for ten minutes and finally had to wave to get another.  Not a big deal but they are in the big leagues.   And charge a lot for a little.
1,"Enjoyed a lovely meal for a bachelorette party. The mood was intimate. Candles were lit everywhere with dim lighting, perfect for a girl's night out. I had the cheese plate and it was delicious! I highly recommend you try the cucumber honey lemonade!"
0,"PLEASE DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY.  Once they have your credit card and deposit, they will ignore you and not return your call.  I left over 10 messages and emails because they were late to pick up my car 1 week.  I had to pay storage fees of over $200.  Maria (the owner) answers the phone and pretends she is not Maria.  Several times she did this and did not forward my messages. After calling maria with a blocked caller id, she picks up the phone and plays dumb about being late.  When you confront her, she will curse and go crazy.  She is the biggest liar i have dealt with and not very stable.  If you want to save yourself time, the headache and stress, please use a different company."

1,"To get this out quickly, the food is ohh so fried. I personally attempt to regulate my fried intake, and hush puppies will be a once in a blue moon treat. but what a treat it is. \n\nI HATE catfish, yet somehow hush puppies has managed to convince me the devils fish is not only edible, but tasty. The meat is not at all gritty, and the batter is fantastic. you can order both fresh and farm raised catfish too! \n\nalligator tail is also very tasty. I like me some Ali tail, and hush puppies does not disappoint. Not too chewy, and not overly battered. Fantastic.\n\nFinally.....Sweet Potato Pie! Can't find good sweet slice outside the south, so just offering this made me happy. If you like sweet potatoes, and you like pie, you will like sweet potato pie. Makes sense right?\n\nP.S Crab legs. Yes, crab legs. And they are generous with them. You get the good legs, not the shriveled legs from the lazy crab that never does push ups. These legs have meat on their bones....or shells, or under the shells....whatever."
0,"I can't in good faith award this place with more than one star at the moment.\n\nWe called Saturday afternoon and made reservations on the rooftop for a group of 8 celebrating a birthday. No mention was made that it was a soft opening with limited menu, but that was indeed the case.\n\nWe walked in to see some friendly smiles awaiting us at the hostess stand which is front and center . The bottom floor was suppose to be \""fine dining\"" the middle more casual, and the top the rooftop bar. I noticed a smell of cigarette smoke as I walked to the second floor and was told that smoking is permitted on the rooftop patio. In my opinion there is nothing like cig smoke to ruin a meal, and felt that smoking should be limited till after dining hours. \n\nThe patio itself was VERY dark (see photo- and that's before sundown). That being said it's a great view of the sky line. Our server did not light the small candles at our table and we went to our neighbors to borrow a lighter. The dim light was not nearly bright enough to see and our table resorted to using their cell phone lights to eat by. My meal had very small bones in it too so I had to be extra careful. If you're drinking at this establishment watch your drink, the dim lights unfortunately leave you susceptible to all kinds of things. Another issue was the chairs were much higher than the table and my 5'7 frame had my legs brushing the table- many of the men in our group couldn't fit their legs underneath.\n\nOur server was a newbie. The dinner service took quite a long time, it was about an hour before we were even able to get our order in (and had to request to do so). She opened a bottle of champagne and was about to literally tilt and pop it until I suggested she use her apron and slowly open it like a soda bottle. She explained she never opened a bottle before. I found that odd for a place that is attempting to be a fine-dining establishment . I asked for some orange juice because I didn't care for the champagne I ordered and she just brought the juice and didn't consider I might have preferred something else. She also walked away from the table mid-sentence while taking our order to  pour drinks at the table next to us. Any issue we had was met with the same excuse \""it's our soft opening.\"" We were still paying full price so we expected our meals and service to at least be decent.\n\nBread was served quite late, and we were definitely hungry two hours into the meal when our food came out.  The taste was  good but the portions were extremely small, temperatures were off (soup was cool),, and it was overpriced. My friend ordered a $15 sandwich ( about the size of an egg Mcmuffin) and asked if it came with a side. Our server said she didn't know and to order it anyway. When she brought it out she explained it wasn't included. Throughout our meal we literally ate with our cell phone lights and the experience was laughable.  We actually had people in our group order additional food at the next place we stopped because they were still very hungry. \n\nI apologize for the long-winded review, but honestly the part which burned me the most was when we explained that it was our friends bday she actually told the birthday girl they didn't do birthdays - the birthday girl! I spoke with management who brought out two desserts after I explained the situation. She was nice and definitely listened to my problems but two small desserts for 8 people was a bit insufficient considering the number of problems we had. \n\nI will give it another shot because it is in the neighborhood, but I'm not sure I'd go as far to order food again there. I hope this place can do better ...."
0,"We stopped by briefly this evening to see what changes Restoration Hardware have made in the new location, but left somewhat disappointed. \n\nThere's still no color here, just beige, off-white, oyster, etc.  The old Restoration Hardware is gone, now it's a furniture/ housewares store which carries only....  beige, off-white, oyster furniture. \n\nUgh. We give up."
0,"Around 8 PM my roommates and I are hungry, not wanting to cook, so we decide on pizza. This Pizza Hut is a stone's throw from our house and we have a coupon, sounds simple enough.\n\nWRONG.\n\nAfter ordering online, I pull up to Pizza Hut around 8:30 and walk up to the door.It's locked. Confused, I try the other door. Locked. There's a boy inside sweeping. He looks at me, I gesture to the door, and he then continues to sweep. Huh?\nI walk back to my car and look up the phone number on my GPS, there is no answer, so I drive home. I get to the house and tell my roommates what happened, so we pull up the online order and see if we were able to order due to a glitch, since they were obviously closed. 9 PM closing time. It's now about 8:45 or so, and my phone rings as we are still looking at the computer. \n\""Hey this is... from Pizza Hut.. are you going to pick up your pizza?\""\nUm...\nI tried..\n\""Okay.. so how long will it take you to get here?\""\nUm...\n5 minutes I guess...\n\nI drive back and walk up to the door. The door is still locked, that kid in the corner is still sweeping. I knock loudly on the door and three people appear from the back kitchen area. \n\n\""Sorry about the mix up, we upgraded your order for you.\""\nOpen the box- instead of the Supreme Pizza Mia we ordered is a very old looking pepperoni stuffed-crust pizza.\nHuh?\n\""So the total is $16.25.\""\nWhat? Is this happening?\n\n.. Um I'm not paying for this...\nEveryone looks at everyone awkwardly, but the kid in the corner keeps sweeping.\n\""Oh.. Okay..hold on.\""\nThe man in a tie, who I assume is the manager goes into the back and grabs one of their new pasta dishes, and puts it on top of the unwanted pizza.\n\""Tell you what- Dinner is on me today, miss, have a great night.\""\nUm.. okay.. Thanks...\nNever got an explanation for the bizarre first trip and more importantly never even got the pizza we ordered.\n\nDrove back home."
0,"Bought a car from them in October 2011. Was told that the title will be issued in 2-3 weeks but it has not been. They said, they don't have title for my car. Car was paid cash. I needed my title. Left message to sales person, sales manager, ang GM multiple times but no one calls back. When ask to speak to a live person, only one I get is a sales person who is not willing to help as it's out of his experties. Also, they had promised an extra set of key for my car. It took them 2 months, to get the key for me. Pretty much, they all are good to you up until you buy the car and drive off. Once off the lot, you are nothing but an ex-client that they dont care for much. But they don't realize that it's the ex-client that gives referrals and comes back. I would not purhcase here again. Horrible after sale experience."
1,"I wanted to go to Oreganos but my bf suggested we go here instead. Place was dead, so our server was really annoying asking us if we ready to order every 2 minutes. Ordered a small pizza with red bell peppers, italian sausage, and pepperoni. Crust was really soggy first couple bites but as you eat towards the end it is so crispy and delightful. Ingredients tasted very fresh and flavorful."
1,"First of all I want to counter comment the review from Brittney S. \nYou went to this place 3 times as you stated and I would hope knew it was a Soul Food place... Therefore alot of fried food. They don't offer smothered there either. If you don't like it, don't go... They didn't force you to order fattening item's feel your review was not accurate. \n\nAnyway, we went on Saturday Oct 8th. Being a girl from the South I am always on the look out for good Southern/Soul food places everywhere. There are not too many in the Phoenix area. \""Mo\"" took our order and recommended some items for me. He was nice and very helpful. We also met the owner \""Papa Joe\"" who was very nice and very appreciative of our patronage. I ordered the pulled brisket sandwich, mac and cheese, greens, corn bread and sweet potato pie. The sandwich reminded me of Texas style BBQ. The mac and cheese was creamy and delicious. The greens were seasoned and delicious as well. The corn bread and desert was also equally pleasing. \nMy boyfriend ordered the ribs, fried okra, jalapeno hush puppies. The sauce on the ribs was tasty and have black pepper in the sauce, the ribs fell apart they were so tender. The okra was not too breaded and was cooked perfect. The hush puppies were great and not spicy hot like one might think. Over all we will go back, it was great food and the staff were nice to us. I do recommend checking this place out if you want a little soul in your hole....."

Can't be that.....so get over to Joann's and get your homemaking on people. Eat, Drink, and be Merry my Friends"
0,"I think it's a reliable mean of transportation here. It's a good idea to commute with monorail when the traffic was jammed. \n\nBut I think cabs, buses and cars are much better when traffic wasn't bad. I bought a 24 bus ticket for $5. And I didn't have to walk long way through hotel to the monorail stations.\n\nAlso renting a car isn't cost much, there are free parking in every hotel here."
0,"Happy Hour 4pm-7pm is the PERFECT time to dine at RA for sushi. Should you decide to dine at RA.\n\n3 gals with an alcoholic bev and enough rolls to roll us home and the total bill was $41 and change.  This was a nice bargain.\n\nBUT.... the 2 stars state it perfectly \""Meh. I've experienced better.\""  That pretty much says it all.  The sushi was okay.  Nothing special that makes me want to go back, so I probably won't unless I am shopping in Kierland and must eat a sushi roll but that probably won't happen. \n\nService was good.  It was that blah sushi. 2 stars.  With plenty of good sushi in town, they gotta step it up.  Do you think they do better sushi before or after happy hour like are they thinking \""ha, it's happy hour and that cheap-skate wants good sushi?!  ha ha ha\""-- I don't know.  But I'm sticking to my other sushi hot spots."
0,The sushi here is fine but nothing special. I placed an order for pick up. I had looked up the menu on two different websites. I ordered three roles to share with my husband and it was suppose to total $20. When I got there it was $28. When I told them that the prices online were different they just said they changed the menu recently. I asked if they had a menu I could take with me they said no. I don't think we will be back. There are better sushi places for the same price.
1,"I really don't think I've ever had a better breakfast that I've had at L'Avenue.  The Eggs Benedict is TO DIE FOR.  And the smoothies?  Even in the dead of winter, I've never tasted something so perfectly ripe.  Insanity all around.  Dinner is also good, but perhaps not as amazing as breakfast.  \n\nAlso, gotta appreciate the bathrooms with the disco ball and movies in the floor.  \n\nThe only bummer: waiting in line for that breakfast.  But worth every minute."
0,"I own a home just up the street from this restaurant and have given them multiple try's because of the convenience.  Unfortunately every time i have dined in the service was very poor and food was lackluster.  Even getting takeout I found the staff to be very unfriendly, food over priced and wait times to be outrageous.  Do yourself a favor and don't waste your time here.  Go up the road to smiths and get yourself a frozen pizza."
1,"I have very tiny nails and so it can sometimes be difficult to fit acrylics to them. Not with Michelle! She skipped gluing a tip on and just sculpted them out with acrylic. They have never looked so beautiful in my life, they are so cute and dainty (but still strong). Aside from my fantastic looking nails, Michelle was a blast to chat with. \n\nI should start by saying she texted me all week trying to get me in (as a first time client) at a time that works with my busy schedule. This goes beyond what I expect from a business into downright brilliant customer service. And then within seconds of meeting her, we were having a naturally flowing conversation, which I have never experienced at a salon because most are filled with predominantly non-english speakers. She is just the loveliest person.\n\nI'm sorry, this review is so long, but I have so many great things to say about the salon. I'll list them now:\n\nMichelle is the best. The rest of the staff is also the best. Michelle is an artist with nails, not just a technician. The spa is adorable. My nails don't feel like clunky acrylics, but like dainty little extensions. The staff is committed to your satisfaction. This is my go-to salon; I will not stray."

0,"I've stayed here many times over the years and the Four Seasons has always been my first choice, but the number of dogs on the property has seriously gotten out of control. On my recent stay I could almost literally not get on the elevator without someone's little yapper trying to bite my ankles, and I almost never walked down the main hall to the lobby without one or more dogs being walked in the hallway. It takes the ambience from elegant to trailer park in a hurry. Fortunately there are no shortage of 5-star hotels in Las Vegas to choose from."
1,By far the most fun I've ever had in Vegas!!!  I had the good fortune to get the Groupon for this place and spent a few fun filled hours driving and excavator. My instructor Phil was awesome!  Amber at the front desk was one of the nicest people I've met in a long time!  I had an absolute blast digging a trench and moving rocks and basketballs. I recommend this place to anyone and everyone I can. I may even try my hand at the bulldozer in the future.
1,"There are many pools to choose from, which was nice if you have kids & teenagers.  There is also a kiddie pool towards the back of the property.  Note that the property is under construction towards the back and the construction workers start at 5am.  If you are a light sleeper, you may want to request a room towards the front closer to the lobby.  Cleaning in the rooms need a little more attention to.   You can feel that the floor isn't mopped very well and the comforters aren't regularly washed after each guest.  Check out time is 10am and will be inspected by the housekeeping staff, guest do not have to stay until it gets inspected.  At check out you are required to put all remote controls in front of the tv's and put all used and unused towels in the bathtub."
1,"One of the alloy wheels on my 2008 BMW was badly gouged by a \""cowboy\"" tire shop, and looked beyond cosmetic repair.  I happened upon this business through a review in Car and Driver magazine.  They work mainly with car dealers but also offer their services to the public.  The people could not have been more charming and the service was incredible.  The damage was too severe for their mobile service, so they took my wheel into their shop overnight and delivered it the next morning.  It is like a new wheel!  All for $125.  Highly recommended!"
0,"Careful with your check. They will get your order right but the charge will charge you higher than what the menu says. Our bartender just gave us a classic cucumber saketini and charge us for a white lotus lycheetini. And gave us the lame excuse that because everyone has been asking for the white lotus she made the mistake to charge us that. Be Smart, check your receipt !!!!!"
0,"We had a very disappointing visit to the Mussel Inn. The soup that I had to start was extremely poor. The mussels were better, but it made us \""kind of sad that I can no longer keep it in my mind as the holy grail of mussel places.\"" \n\nOverall, we said: \""It's an extremely popular place, as was evidenced by the lively and diverse crowd packed in for a busy lunchtime service, but I was pretty underwhelmed by the quality, particularly of the soup.\"""
1,"Not sure why people don't like this place in the reviews. \n\nIs it expensive? Yes, but no more do than its peers in the hotel-the convenience fee one pays in the strip. \n\nSince the wait staff were speaking Cantonese we stuck to the Hong Kong staples on the menu. Well prepared classics that of be happy with at any authentic Chinese restaurant. Not high end Hong Kong dining, but certainly not a hawkers market offering.  Definitely not the American food crap most Midwesterners mistakenly call Chinese food. \n\nCrispy Noodles were well seasoned and quite flavorful. BBQ pork was maybe a touch dry but still full of flavor. Siu Mai was a decent offering. Stir fried vegetables were fresh, green, crisp and write tasty. Had a Japanese colleague with me so we ordered the potstickers too-gotta reaffirm the supremacy of the almighty gyoza. They were quite good and well received, except that they were chicken."
1,"It's still as divey as ever here at La Bayou Casino.  It's run down, cramped and there's dusty stuff all over the walls and ceilings.  God knows I love this place!  It's one of the coolest places in downtown Vegas and they always get my business.\n\nFrom the time you walk in the door and get your beads and raffle ticket till the time you leave, it's non-stop free drinks, cool employees and loose slots.\n\nYou know how most casinos only offer you free drinks when you are playing the $1 slots or better.  Not here!  I walked up, got some Mardi Gras beads and before I could sit down they asked me what I wanted to drink.  I hadn't gotten half way done and she are offering me another drink.  These ladies usually come by about once every 10 minutes so drink fast and get your moneys worth.  By the way, these aren't pussy drinks either - you can taste the alcohol.\n\nTheir slot machines are usually pretty loose (not this time but usually).  The machines are retro coin payers so don't be looking for slots with tie ins to the latest movies or TV shows and be sure to have a cup or two handy for your big win.\n\nLike I said before, I'm still loving Barbara (manager) and Mary Ellen (cashier).  They are part of the experience and if they ever leave, the place just won't be the same.\n\nMan I want to go back there right now."
0,Went here for lunch on a weekday. The service was awful. It took over an hour to order and get our food. The food was ok. Nothing special. I wouldn't go here again.
1,I had fillet steak and it was delicious.  The creamed corn was to die for ... I would definitely recommend it.\n\nThe service was really good but I would definitely book a table in advance as we were given 'bar' seats and they were so damn uncomfortable. \n\nIt is quite expensive but for a once in a while treat its probably worth it.\n\nWe were also fortunate to eat before the DJ made his mark on the place and given that we were sat right next to the booth I'm glad we got out of there before. \n\nI would recommend this place but only for a special occasion or treat due to the price.
0,"I still rate this restaurant a solid three stars for the lasagna or the $10 dinner in general but when it comes to the 'finer\"" dishes ... read on.\n\nI decided to try the Chicken Rollatine this time , mushrooms, prosciutto, Marsala wine etc. Back in the day I would have ordered the veal but I've been dissuaded from eating veal again because of  the way they're treated, downer So chicken it is, but if you are going to sell me  a $17 plate of chicken in a dated, tacky restaurant on East Independence it better be good, real good! \n\nThe service was very attentive and quick, the dinner rolls were very tasty and the glass of house Cabernet was pretty good for the price.  End of the good stuff. \n\nThe blue cheese dressing for the salad was the same generic stuff they serve in cafeterias. definitely unsuitable in a good restaurant and the salad was equally indifferent. The main dish looked absolutely terrific but I couldn't believe what I tasted on the first bite. I stopped, took a second bite to confirm my impression.  \nOther than a faint trace of Marsala the sauce might as well been brown gravy, totally bland, I couldn't taste the mushrooms (because they were the tasteless pre-sliced canned ones) or  Prosciutto  or pepper or capers or rosemary or anything that resembles Italian cuisine! Also they don't offer to grate parmesan or grind fresh pepper over the dish, instead on the table were the same dispensers you find in cheap pizza joints, powdered imitation cheese. \n\nI didn't see the point in ordering a different dish. Instead I asked the waitress to take the plate  back to the kitchen and please use a little more Marsala,, pepper etc. The owner came by and took it to the kitchen. The dish was back 5 minutes later, warmer and with a stronger taste of the wine this time. I poured some more pepper and the taste was now \""acceptable\"". The owner paced the whole time for no good reason and as he sped by me he went \""Good for you now?\"" - a real class act. \n\nI wondered how can they get away with selling food that's so bland but when I looked around I realized that just about every customer was over 65 - well over some of them.  That may help explain it.\n\nMy advice is to stick to the simpler, less expensive items on the menu and don't be fooled into taking Fontanella for a fine restaurant. If I was the manager I would have straighten out that kitchen in a matter of weeks."
0,"S-K-I-P IT for sure. Way overhyped. We were lucky enough to get a VIP booth (because it wasn't reserved at the time) wich was cool just for the fact that you could actually sit down. The waitresses have high expectation for orders.The girls are fakey. The drinks were strong, but overpriced. The gaming tables had like $150 or $200 minimums. And oh,yeah it was boring. As we were leaving I actually saw a 20 something plastic barbie getting into a car with a 60 something guy. No thanks. Nice to see once, but not again."
1,"Had the south side street dog and it was excellent.  Portions were big and the sausage they used was great_.  lFor dessert crushed the deep fried smores, also excellent.  Tables near bars facing the kitchen have a perfect view of every game on TV.  Went for MNF and had a good time."

0,"First dangerous indicator is that most of these reviews are either one star or 5.  I am not saying the 5 stars are fake, but it makes me suspicious.\n\nFrom my personal experience, do not trust these people.  They LIE!!!  OK.  Maybe I shouldn't be shocked that car dealers lie, but to have blatant boldfaced advertisement that is an undeniable lie shows how overtly shady Chapman Mazda is.  When I purchased my car there in 2011, I was given a $10 oil change for the life of the vehicle card.  By life of the vehicle they must have meant 2 years.  They discontinued the offer and their explanation was that they could change an offer anytime they want.  I understand changing an offer to new buyers, but changing it on people who purchased on a \""life of the vehicle\"" offer is just being dishonest.  The service manager told me on the phone that they are offering an oil change at a price that nobody else is matching.....$30????  Wow!  I have never heard of an oil change for less than $31...another blatant boldfaced LIE.  These people are just so dishonest.  If they are willing to advertise so falsely, imaging what other lies they are willing to tell just to make a couple extra bucks."
0,I can't tell you if the food is any good. We put our order in at 12:30p and after a half hour we still had no lunch. Several other people ahead of us cancelled and left \n\nWe left so I hope the next people have better luck. If you see only two people in the kitchen expect to wait and wait and wait.
0,"One star Is grossly exaggerating how good this is. Negative stars is the practical reality of this joint. We live in the neighborhood and so desperately want to like this place (and McDowell Mtn ranch golf grill- alas that place sucks arguably worse but don't get me started on that). Unfortunately the food stinks, the service stinks, and the the prices are hysterically high but for the fact that they genuinely expect you to pay them. I would take my chances at the chess club vs. going back here. Yuk."
0,"On August 17, 2014 at about 2pm, I called Oasis Auto Spa to ask if they could wash my truck completely by hand becuase the moon roof on my Ford F-150 was not sealing completely.  The pleasant man on the phone assured me it would be no problem to wash the truck and that I should arrive between 3:30 and 4pm so they could finish before they closed at 5pm. \n\nI drove about 20 min from home to Oasis and arrived at 3:30pm, as instructed, and was told they \""may not\"" be able to get to me becuase someone else had taken my place.\n\nThey suggested I wait because they \""should be able to finish the car before me with enough time to also finish my truck.\""\n\nI waited about 30 minutes and at 4pm, the same pleasant man who assured me on the phone they would be able to wash my truck, told me they had to begin closing and would not be able to wash my truck.  So I wasted about 90 miniutes of my day and left with a dirty truck.\n\nI work in the customer service industry and my clients never leave my office until whatever they need is finished, regardless of my \""posted hours\"".  I will never return to Oasis Auto Spa."
1,"Food still good, but the wait was loong. Upon seating, we were told the kitchen was slow today, which I'm glad they told us beforehand. On a Sunday afternoon, this place was more packed than I've ever seen it. Food was gooood. Pad-see-eww was yummy"
1,If i am craving Korean BBQ this is the place i come. They always have great tasting Bulgogi/Kalbi and the Banchans they offer are great. The service is always good and attentive.
1,This place is great! Today I had the west coast sandwich and it was amazing. One of the best sandwiches in the area. The chicken is perfect for the sandwich. And the waffle as bread is a cool idea. My girlfriend and I normally go in here for smoothies and this was the first time I ate food and I was not disappointed. The smoothies are really good as well the first time I had a smoothie with tofu I didn't think I would like it because of the tofu but it gets better ever time! Would  totally recommend this place to others!
0,"Maybe other Sam Woo BBQ restaurants are better but we just had a terrible experience at the one in Vegas last night.  We ordered the 2 item combo that had roasted duck and roasted pork, 3 Flavor chow mein, and Chinese broccoli.  The chow mein and broccoli came out pretty quick but then we waited for 15 min or longer but the duck and pork still had not arrived!  We saw another table get a big plate of duck too.  WTF?  We finally asked our waiter where our duck and pork is and he said \""Oh, we're out of duck and pork.  I'm sorry I forgot to tell you.\""  Are you fucking kidding me?  You \""forgot\"" to tell us???  Then my friend asked \""Do you have duck?\""  The guy said no but then when we asked again, he said that they have duck.  OMG!  We got the plate, which is $9.20 for 2 pieces of duck.  There's 3 size servings for duck.  Whole, half, and plate.  When we got the bill, they charged us $14.95 for the 2 pieces of duck!  We didn't really question it at first and the paid.  As we walked out, I said \""Fuck that, there's not way that duck was $14.95!!!\"" and I went back inside to look @ the menu.  They never took off the charge of the 2 item of duck and pork that we never got!!!!  They gave us the $6.25 that was due back to us.  Yeah, not going back here again.  Always scrutinize the bill when eating out and don't be afraid of questioning the bill if you see something wrong."
1,"Hoover Dam tour\nGreat tour company. I was in an off strip hotel and other tour companies throughout my week here refused to come pick me up. This company offered to come get me for $20 extra - much less than a cab fare. I turned them down however as I had a rental. I drove to a strip hotel to get picked up. The driver was early. The Hummer H2 was clean and nice and provided a smooth ride. The Hummer seats a driver plus 7 - 2 in the back, 3 in the middle and 1 up front with the driver. We stopped to pick up 4 others then drove 45 minutes out to the Hoover Dam. All the way he provided commentary on history and what we were seeing. At the dam he drove us around so we could get pictures then he gave us our tickets for the power plant tour. We had the tour and time to take pics - about 2 hrs in all before we met up again for the ride back. He does not do the guiding at the dam, a dam employee does that. He was very knowledgeable however about the dam and could answer any questions. I really recommend this tour company. Even though since I had a rental I could have driven out here myself the guide did definitely add value to the experience. It was also nice to have the logistics all taken care of."
0,"Went to this restaurant again and now I see why there were bad reviews before. I must of had a lucky previous experience. However, this time we went it was not a very good experience at all. We went on Saturday night (around 6pm, so it wasn't busy at all). We were seated right away in the dining area. We sat down and we waited, and we waited for a server to even look at us. Oh wait, there were SEVERAL servers looking at us, all gathered at the bar. Not sure 'what' they were serving, but there were 5 of them just talking. I'm assuming it was waiters for the teppanyaki?? Regardless, it was annoying. We even had to witness a waiter or bus boy or someone picking up one of the hostess' (who might I add, was wearing a skirt). Very classy Ah-So. Where were the grown ups in this place?! \n\nSo after 7 minutes of waiting. May not seem like a long time, but you need to be greeted within in 1-2 min. tops in my book (or at least told 'we'll be with you in a moment). We finally get a waiter come up to us and ask 'Have you been waited on?'. Really? You don't know?! We are staring into the wide open restaurant with a glazed look on our faces with menus closed (waiting to order) and no drinks. No...we have not been waited on. Bitter? Yes, just a little, but I was just so sick of bad customer service this topped the cake.\n\nThe waiter we finally got was nice enough, but the food this time was sub-par.  Maybe that is because we weren't drinking sake bombers this time. :o) And the rolls came out a minute after the appetizer--my biggest pet peeve, I like to enjoy my appetizer first. Anyway, the California roll I had seemed warm and tasted very bland. However, one of the pieces of the shrimp roll I snagged  from my husband, was good.  But my husband wasn't totally sold on the other roll he had as well (I forgot which one...salmon I think). And the Gyoza we had as an appetizer was okay.\n\nOverall, I was disappointed with this dining experience."
1,Love their coupons and produce prices. Good stop if you need a quick meal.
0,"+++ This business has closed +++\n\nJohnny Rockets is replacing JR Burger Grill at this location (Aug 23, 2013)"
0,"I dined at the restaurant prior to seeing Viva Elvis at the hotel. The restaurant claims to be a Thai restaurant, but it seemed to be more of a fusion. I had order Pad See Ew and received Pad Thai. All of the food tasted the same and the waiters treated us as if they were doing us a favor. The only thing that was slightly average was the wine. I would not recommend this restaurant even if one was looking to simply waste their money."
1,Best sushi I've had in Arizona so far. That being said most of the sushi I've had here has been terrible. They'll sub brown rice instead of white rice for an additional dollar
1,"I've ridden my bike here with friends and lunched on the non-smoking patio a few times. I always order the Reuben and have never been disappointed. The service is good and the waitresses are friendly.\n\nI just learned that both patios are dog friendly, as long as the dogs are leashed.  I'll add Duke's to my list of Dog Friendly establishments. Peekaboo is going to be happy to hear that."
0,"I have to say that the place is new, pretty nice inside, the bartender was good. And started to get busy while we were there.... All we ordered food wise was the pretzels which came out slow, but hit and they tasted great. We had 3 beers and a Bloody Mary between the two of us and our bill was as $51. I know this is Vegas and things may cost a little more. However, $11 for Angry Orchard is ridiculous. I know how much they pay for their legs and they are purposely gouging you on the cost of their draft beer. $51 for 2 pretzels and some beers. Lame. I wouldn't suggest or come back based on how expensive it is. I should add I have visited a Tilted Kilt in Arizona and it was not nearly as expensive. Vegas prices will keep me from ever coming back."
1,"Thanks to you yelpers I decided to order take-out on the way home.  This is a nice, clean, small place and the people are friendly.  Had the yellow chicken curry which was really good and flavorful.  Also the singapore noodles which I love but wasn't expecting mushrooms.  I know every place makes them a little different so I will remember to ask for no mushrooms next time.  Also didn't care for peanuts in my curry either but that's just me.  Will come back again and try some other dishes.  Be sure to check for silverware though, I only received one plastic fork."

1,I have been a patient of Dr Newman's for 10 years and would never trust anyone else with my women's care.  His easy going personality and sense of humor  puts me at ease when normally I'm a ball of nerves at doctors appts.  Aside from this I know he also has a tremendous amount of compassion and respect for his patients and truly cares about their well-being.  I feel very confident in saying he is the best doctor I have ever had.
0,"Based on my experiences in the other stores in the surrounding area this one was the worst.  The staff were bored and not very helpful and just completely humorless.  I got a \""you're not ready for this color\"" which normally i would find funny but her tone was so dismissive that it soured everything.  I wouldn't recommend for the staff but the products are beautiful!"
1,"Thank you to CrossFit Max Effort for having a fantastic drop-in program, great coaches and a beautiful facility!  I was in town for work and dropped in to the 7am morning classes for two days.  I was welcomed into the class and the coach helped me with my technique even though I was only a visitor.  Thank you CrossFit Max Effort!"
1,"Jimmy's is one of our favorite local Italian hangouts - we come here at least twice monthly. Had another great meal - chicken parm, side salad with creamy garlic dressing and a couple of bud lights...a nice break from thanksgiving leftovers! Definitely try it if you haven't been."
1,"What great pizza! Good thin-crust brick-oven pizza. Not overloaded with cheese and toppings, but rather just enough. The place has a good atmosphere and nice staff. One the few really good pizza places I've found since moving to Vegas 15 years ago."
1,Had a blast!  Full of entertainment and laughs.  These ladies know how to work it!  Bowling was very fun too.  Can't wait to go again!
0,"Not real Asian food by any means but it will fill you up if you are on a budget. \nOn the plus side, the place is kept very clean and it's fast. \nBe careful if you are diabetic, the chain uses a TON of sugar in everything. It's what they substitute because PE doesn't use MSG."
0,"Maybe two and a half stars... maybe. The food is just nothing spectacular, the restaurant looks kind of thrown together and in the summer it's hot inside. WikiWiki is so close to my house that I really want to love it, but the passion isn't there, things seem rushed. I'll keep coming here occasionally because it's so close and my only Hawaiian food fix, but I really hope it gets better."
0,"Don't shop for a pet there! Seriously, are all the comments fake? Dogs kept in fish tanks with a tiny little water bottles. Who is vetting them and where they come from? I give zero stars here!"
0,"It should never ever  - ever EVER take 30 minutes to get a burrito bowl, no matter how long the line is.  Yes, it was lunch time but management should have this under control.  2 stars only because I heart chipotle."

0,Quicky breakfast. really an upscale denny's. Not spectacular but not awful either. Yeah they have pie.
0,"I would give zero stars if I could.  Janey T. completely agrees with me.  Lawsuits?  The owner told me, \""I ALWAYS win.\""  Hmmm, sounds as if I'm not the only unhappy customer.  Do NOT hire these people.  Extremely unprofessional and, in my opinion, psycho!"
1,"Superb food, service, and decor\n\nI'm a fan of TFK.  Everyone in our family likes the food. It's a very nice setting for a meal and deserves some interior design awards. And I feel a tad better about myself after eating there-- as if the healthy menu someone cleanses me more than 30 Hail Marys and Our Fathers.\n\nOur girls usually are stoked to have the Watermelon Lemonade with Almond Butter, Strawberry & Banana Sandwich.  I love the Kale Salad with chicken added.  And my wife tends to go for pretty much anything on the Pizza or Entr\u00e9es menu that doesn't have mushrooms associated with it.\n\nService was the usual attentive standard we're used to.  The girl even had some hiragana tattooed behind her ear, allowing me to inconspicuously refresh my reading skills.\n\nWe'll be back, again.  I still need to try their juice bar options."
1,This place is so cute. I've had lots of different kinds of ice cream and they are all great. I love the cookie dough/rocky road bar! The texture is perfect.
0,Perhaps the worst so-called Italian food I have ever eaten.
1,"Open 24/7 means drunk muchies. \n\nFor about $7- $8 you get an overall pretty decent sandwich.\n\nSizewise I would say it's an 7inch ciabatta bread...  \n\nI had the Earl's club, which is turkey and bacon with sauce/tomatoes/lettuce on top.  Not too bad, not too bad at all.  Definitely one of the most moist turkey I've ever had! The bread and everything put together was excellent.  \n\nThe cashier was very friendly as well as she entertained some of us drunkies while waiting for our sandwiches! :)"
0,I work right above Tropical Smoothie Caf\u00e9 and went almost everyday.  The gentleman behind the register is wonderful HOWEVER the staff in the back area are just plain rude.  Definite attitudes and I decided that there are too many wonderful places in Metropolitan to have to put up with that.  Food was good and the smoothies delightful but I won't go back!
0,"The wings were ok but got mostly legs. I prefer wings. The cheese dip was cold but flavors were Ok. The staff is funny and friendly. The fish and chips were over cooked.   \n\nEverything was overpriced. For 2\nCokes, 2 small margaritas, chips and cheese salsa, fish\nAnd chips, and wings , the price was $85 !"
0,I will never go to this place again. My vehicle had burnt rubber pieces on the back tires after they were (they never called me to say they had finished after two hours) done changing the oil. There was also paint marks on the tires and my brakes smelled burned. When confronted they denied being responsible for any of it. My friend drove in for a oil change the very same day. The services were paid for and when he checked his vehicle he found that the oil filter and oil were never changed. All that was done is a small clean of the engine where the oil normally goes in. They seem nice enough but beware.
0,"Once again not nuts about this place.  Food seems to have lost its flavor, the front counter folks could put a smile or two on their faces.  I cant stand when someone hates their job and you can tell!"
1,I came in here on. st patricks day. I loved their food. My steak was cooked perfectly and our waitress was really proffessional. The ambiance is cozy/kinda sportsy. They had tv playing with the habs game on. However they did have another side in the restaurant so maybe thats where you can have more of a sit down experience. Anyway I enjoyed their food and wine collection. Until next time :)
1,"Stopped here the day before my birthday to get my coworkers a treat. The doughnuts were fresh, the service was fast, and the prices were ok. Not cheap, but definitely ok. Where this place shines is in the creativity. The only one I remember in particular was the Fat Elvis, and that alone will keep me coming back for more. All of my coworkers were desperate to know where I got the doughnuts. If you're on this side of town, it's a must try.\n\nEdit: Now open 24 hours."
0,"Service was good.  We won't be returning, though.\n\nThey are trying to be like TX Roadhouse, with the peanuts. Which is fine, but they are so overpriced, and the food was horrible!  The only thing we liked was the bread, and the baked potato soup was wonderful.\n\nI got filet mignon. and a sweet potato. Both tasted horrible (how do you ruin those?).  The filet had waaaaaaaaay too much seasoning on it and I couldn't eat it. No clue what they did to the sweet potato. The waitress asked if we wanted to talk to a manager; I said no, this is our first time here and we won't be returning due to price and qualilty, and no need to talk to a manager about it. \n\nMy hubby got an appetizer for his meal and it was quite small, so if you normally do that kind of thing, beware that it is a smaller portion."
0,"We like a good donut every once in awhile. Dunkin Donuts is usually great...but this Surprise one blows. There is nothing worse than having a craving for a Bavarian creme donut, just to get there and find out that they do not have any. This is the norm for this Dunkin. Every time we go there they never have the Bavarian creme donut. If it is soooo popular you would think they would want to keep them in stock so they could profit off of them. Guess that is not the case with this place."
0,"Great customer service at lunch. Order the lunch special and 6 other customers get served before me. Wait 45 minutes then get up to leave. Am asked \""Do I want that to go?\"" Can anyone say @DirtyDrummer?"
1,"Tried them again with the kids last night and have a few new things to say since my last visit.\n\nI had Bombero sauce put onto a carne asada Chimi this time, and it was FABULOUS.  Works better on a chimi than a burrito, I think, because the sauce makes the burrito tortilla \""wet\"" and does not have the same soggy effect on the fried shell of the chimi.\n\nThe carne asada last night was smokey and awesome.  It has not been this good on my prior visits.  It was pure, smokey goodness this trip.\n\nThe chicken hard-shell tacos held together better too....after falling apart last trip.  I wonder if they changed their shell a little?  Anyway, they were delicious.\n\nA word about the \""salad\"" too - it is that micro-shredded lettuce and a few tomatoes and a little white Mexican cheese sprinkled on top.  And it was all perfectly fresh and delicious.\n\nThe beans again were better than your average refried beans - something about them I can't place for sure, but they are delish.\n\nThe staff was great and friendly.  I'm gonna spend more time eating here.  It's pretty darn outstanding...."
0,"Horrible service. I bought a $400 belt for a buddy of mine for his birthday and he went the next day to get a bigger size, never wore it or even really touched it. They told him they couldn't exchange it because it seemed a bit bent like if it was worn.\n\nMoreover, the customer \""service\"" salesperson brought the belt into the back room and came back with an obvious new hole in the belt. She said that we did it, even though they gift wrap the box and we didn't even touch it after buying it and it was brought back the same day!\n\nDespicable store. GO SOMEWHERE ELSE. Blatant fraudsters won't even give you any service. I will not let this go lightly."
1,"This location has been a Mega Cafe and a Cocos, The other day I was driving by and I noticed it was open again, this time as a Mexican restaurant. Today I was working in the area when lunch time arrived, so I gave it a try and am I glad I did.\n\nI walked in and was seated, it was early so there was no crowd. The waiter immediately brought the menu, salsa dip and bean dip with tortilla chips and ask for my beverage choice, I chose iced tea. \n\nI scanned the menu, a lot of variety. I ordered one of the lunch specials, a beef chimichanga.  While waiting I started eating the chips with the dips, both were very good and the chips were freshly made. I'm enjoying the chips, look up and my meal is already here\n\nIt was a nice size chimichanga, with guacamole, sour cream and pico de gallo on the side, with rice and beans. The chimi was excellent, shredded beef and cheese, the rice and beans were average, but good.\n\nAll this for $7.50 including the drink. I will be back often.\n\nThe staff was friendly, the food very good and the prices good. Give it a try"
1,"We had a  really nice dinner here last night. The restaurant as a whole is really nice, well kept, and has a nice ambiance. The bar at the entrance is clean, well stocked, has a good bartender, and prices are reasonable.\n\nThe restaurant has a some really nice private dining options. \n\nFor couples, there are small 2 person booths that look out over the city, in a private area. They  have their backs to a hallway, curtains separate the booths themselves, and the view is fantastic.\n\nFor groups, their are options private dining rooms which look like they could seat 15+ people.\n\nThe general dining area is broken into balcony and indoor seating, both are spacious, and have a view of the open kitchen, something I like.\n\nThere is also a bar in the main dining area which looks over the kitchen, which is pretty cool.\n\nThe service was very good, and even while our waitress was busy, others came by to ensure we were taken care of.\n\nWe ordered their small seafood platter as an appetizer, which included King Crab, Muscles, Shrimp, and Oysters. All of it tasted fresh and was great. Their cocktail sauce is also fantastic. \n\nFor  dinner, I had the 17oz sirloin, ordered medium-rare. We also shared sides of their smashed potatoes and cauliflower gratin.\n\nThe steak was seasoned well, and cooked perfectly. The sides were also excellent. I  also was lucky enough to try the Scallops as one of my dinner mates had ordered them, they were velvety soft and delicious.\n\nI thought the pricing to be really fair, even cheap, compared to what I expected and what I got. It was a very good experience overall, and I will return."
0,"This place has got to be the most disgusting, overly-packed, and over-hyped night club Vegas has to offer. \n\nIt's like a rain forest in there...except rain forests get their humidity from the elements..this place gets its humidity from the sweat, farts, and carbon dioxide coming out of the crowd at a rate faster than a 30mm minigun can shoot. \n\nI'm trying to dance, why can't this stupid guy stop rubbing against me? I prefer being rubbed against by queens and princesses, not some sweat-soaked white boy in an ugly argyle patterned 7 Diamond shirt. The bar is ridiculously packed and strained. Don't expect to get your drink while it's still cold at the bar. \n\nIf you want to experience how it was like riding in a Russian cattle cart off to the harbor in Stalingrad during the '40s, hit this place up."
1,"Mon Ami Gabi is located in Paris hotel (visible on the Vegas strip).  I've passed by it numerous times but never gotten a chance to try it until my friend hosted my Bridal Shower Brunch here.  \n\nWe were seated on the patio which had an atrium feel.  It was very romantic.  With our large party, our server was so on task and efficient.  He  was probably the best server I've ever had-- incredibly attentive and nice.  \n\nI decided to order my go to dish- Eggs Benedict.  There is nothing better than breaking that yolk into the hollandaise sauce and soaking it up with the English muffin and ham.  I had to deduct a star because my English muffin was hard as a rock.  It was probably sitting on the hot plate for too long and got stale as it was waiting.  Other than that, the poached egg and sauce was great.  \n\nI also tried my friend's savory crepe and skinny pancakes.  They were both very good.  \n\nThe entire restaurant was so nice and accommodating to our party.  It probably helps that you were going to be a bride very soon.  But nonetheless, I really enjoyed the food, ambiance, and company."
1,"Great produce, meats, deli, bakery and great beers on tap."
0,Wow I have never had such a nasty room in Vegas. Dirty room asked to be switched and they moved me into a room with a broken bed. I spent ten minutes sitting in the hallway in between moves. They did nothing to compensate for the hassle. DO NOT STAY HERE. I'll be lucky if I don't get bed bugs. Serious yuck.\nNight life is fun here but stay sleep elsewhere.  ZERO STARS!!
1,"Came here back in June for the Britney Spears concert with my daughter. Not the best accoustics, but still a fairly nice venue. This was the most bizarre concert I've ever attended. It's not the venue's fault, but it was a weird experience. We sat in the unfixed seats in the back, just above the first level. An older couple sat next to us because the wife used a cane. First of all, I thought I would have been the oldest person there, I'm 41, but this couple was in their mid to late sixties. I heard the man tell his wife to sit the f*ck down...nice guy, right? During the opening act & the Nicki Minaj portion of the concert, he kept looking through his binoculars at them...EW. Then Britney came out. He danced as well as he could being old, white & sitting down. Again, he ogled Britney & her dancers through his binocs. Some poor girl had the misfortune of walking past then stopping in front of them on the walkway just above the top row of seats in the lower section. They yelled at her and told her to, \""Get the f*ck out of the way!!\"". She left, quite bewildered at being verbally assulted by a couple of old geezers at a Britney Spears concert. The part of Britney's show came in which she asks a male member of the audience to come on stage and dance with her. The fool old man was waving his hand wildly in the air, like a the kiss-ass smart kid in your elementary school class kind of hand raising! Fortunately for everyone in that arena, she picked a younger, better looking man....phew! About 10 minutes later, a group of 4 girls decided they wanted to dance where the first girl had earlier got her ass verbally handed to her by Mr. & Mrs. Hemorrhoid.  Again, they yelled obscenities at the girls, he pushed one of them and the wife was pushing them with her cane! The girls asked my daughter & I if we minded if they moved in front of us. We told them it was fine, we could still see just fine. Then one of the girls told the man that it was not OK to hit a woman. He says, \""I didn't hit you, I pushed you!\""...wow. Sorry girls, he's taken!"
1,Fantastic food every time!!!!!! My favorite when coming up from Tucson!!! I found this spot about 6 yrs ago and every time I get up to the Valley I always stop in and eat and also do a little shopping in the market store as well :) Great prices on the spices!!!!
1,"YUMMY food!\n\nsuch good red wine.\n\ni have no idea what we ordered, but every single dish that came up was really really good.\n\ni wish i knew spanish so i know what we ordered, but give it a try...it might surprise you."
1,"Shame the HD design center closed, but that gives Target it's very own parking deck.  I got a little confused and really thought Target had closed as well, but then realized I was on the wrong level of the parking deck... talk about needing a light bulb above my head literally and figuratively.\n\nI was pleasantly surprised that this location is super clean and offers groceries.  It is a rather large Target... don't let the location fool you.... bring comfortable walking shoes."
0,"Went for lunch. As with any Vegas buffet, the quality of the food is a gamble, and not one you're very likely to win. Sadly, this one counts as a big loss.\n\nAside from the typical decor, it doesn't even feel like a restaurant. Plates and utensils are washed en masse, resulting in eating surfaces that look like they were simply sprayed with a hose and dipped in sanitation solution. In other words, everything looks dirty.\n\nThe food is awful. There's really no other way to put it. Looking at positive reviews, I can't for the life of me understand how anyone could eat this stuff with a smile. Maybe low prices are intoxicating their sense of judgment or they have the perfect combination of deadened taste buds and iron stomachs. The only other buffet I've been to that's worse than this one was at Sante Fe Station, and that one induced vomiting.\n\nOne can't help but shake the feeling this is the foods last chance at being served. Most of the options appear to be right at the borderline of expiration, or at least of the lowest quality. There are seven sections: BBQ, American, Asian, Italian, Mexican, Dessert and the Salad Bar. Don't even think about seafood, because there isn't any. I did my best to try a bit of everything, but it was tough finding anything appetizing from the Asian or Mexican areas. They don't even look right.\n\nMeats are profoundly dry, akin to soft wood. Vegetables are fresher than anything, but the taste of the cooked ones manages to be awful as well. Fruit amounts to little more than watermelon. Meanwhile, you have a bountiful selection of breads. Great. And don't forget dessert. It rounds out the stomach cramps nicely. Though to be fair, they do have a gelato station that sticks out like a sore thumb in a place like this.\n\nI can handle a bad meal as much as anyone, but this stuck with me the rest of the day, assaulting my stomach with night terrors. The single thing I can honestly say I enjoyed was a potato. I implore anyone with a mouth to go anywhere but this people trough. Even from a financial point of view, the food court will satisfy more for the same price."
0,"Took my jeep here after someone broke into it and had stolen my stereo. Was ignored for quite a while, then was finally helped. After choosing a stereo and waiting for the install, the installer told me I needed a bracket and a Torx screw driver that he didn't have. He told me I should be able to get the bracket from the dealer. I thought this all strange but went searching for the mysterious bracket anyway. I first went searching for the bracket, waited in line at the dealer for 15 min only to find out they show no such bracket in the manual. So off I got to purchase a torx screwdriver. I got back to the kid and told him about the bracket, he said forget it he'll figure something out. He also told me he didn't need the torx screwdriver either. Not happy, I waited for this half-wit to install my stereo. I got it back sounded ok but the head unit was loose and flopped around. You have been warned!"
1,"Great service and great food!  \n\nMy friend saw an ad for this place in a local newspaper and we decided to check it out tonight.  My friend and I ordered the \""Flat bread and Dip Trio\"" and \""Bruschetta Pizza.\""  Both were excellent choices!  The service was great, very friendly people!  \n\nNot sure how the other people who wrote reviews left unsatisfied but we LOVED it!"
1,Its clean its fast its good food that wont break the bank :)
0,"The ONLY reason I go to this Vons is because it is literally 2 minutes from my house.  Unfortunately, it is WAY overpriced on everything and the produce sucks.  In addition, the checkout lines are ALWAY at least 6 people deep.  Ridiculous!  I often will drive the extra 5 minutes to Smiths on Maryland just to get better produce and way less expensive groceries.  \n\nThe first time I went to this Vons, I was looking for scallops, and the guy told me they only sold them by the pound.  He showed me the pre-packaged frozen bag of scallops and the cost was $40!!!  I immediately drove to Smiths and got some fresh huge scallops from the fresh meat & seafood department for $7.99 a lb.  The extra 5 minute drive is worth it!"
0,"I have eaten here about a half-dozen times. Once on New Years' eve in order to see the fireworks from the patio.\n\nThe view from the patio is awesome! Across from the Bellagio and it's dancing fountains. Quintessential Las Vegas views down the boulevard in either direction. The patio of Mon Ami Gabi is truly the epicenter of Las Vegas.\n\nThe decor is that of a Parisian French bistro one would find on the holodeck of the Starship Enterprise. Almost too perfect. But certainly very nice.\n\nThe service was also very good. No real complaints.\n\nSo why two stars? Because the food SUCKS and they know it. And they don't care.\n\nBut the view from the patio at night is so compelling. It is worth the mediocre food. It really is. But gee, this place could be SO much more. So as a restaurant it gets 2 stars. But for a one-time reasonably priced dinner for a tourist, that patio view is worth the price of admission."
1,Only been to a handful or airports and this one is as good as any that I've seen.
0,"The worst experiance ever!!After driving 10 hours from sf bay area,Upon check in at The hotel,I was told \""Pet Friendly\"" ment a 20 pound yipping ,crapper could stay but my little caged bird had to go!I was not only told to leave,but when I called Vegas.com to complain I was told tough shit you can't have a refund you did not cancel 24 hours in advance.We Might charge you ALL three Days!!After some threats of a lawsuit I was refunded all of my purchase,but had nowhere to stay..."
0,"No matter how often I'm there, the staff is horribly rude - not just to me but to every customer. If I ever find another place to take children's items, I will not return. There is no excuse for the ugly attitude and behavior to everyone."
0,"Well prepared but watered down Thai food.  Potential is huge, but food has been \""Americanized\"".  Sad, because authentic thai food is full of flavors dancing in your taste buds."
1,"Every time I get a loaf of their bread, I come home, cut a slice, and eat it right at the counter. And then I cut another slice, and another. Until I realize that I'm standing in the middle of the kitchen just eating bread. \n\nTheir bread is amazing, and look at ingredients - my kalamata olive loaf had 5 total and I knew them all (water, flour, etc) I don't get the bread sliced at the store and haven't had the moldy problem yet. If I know I won't eat it quickly, I put the bread in a fridge. But it does taste best on the day it's baked.\n\nI haven't tried their pastries but I noticed Turner's milk products in a small fridge and some cheeses in a cooler. Giant Eagle across the street doesn't carry Turner's and East End Coop is a bit far to go for just milk. This place might save you some driving if you need just the basics."
0,"I don't really like to talk shit about restaurants but this place was absolutely horrible. For $5 extra you can go to a place like sushi mon and have freshly made all-u-can-eat sushi and side dishes. I paid for my girlfriend and I , but we couldn't eat any of the sushi because of how horrible it was."
0,"Seriously? The name says it all! \n\nThis place is like the worst, darkest most horrifying section of HELL!\n\nThis review is for the buffet restaurant only. \n\nMy friend (who I'm not in touch with anymore) dragged me here on our last day of vacation. Oh boy...\n\nThe place is the trashiest, the public are red nacks or white trash old people who burnt all of their money in gambling in the shittiest casinos & therfore dont have the budget or the class to go anywhere else! \nThe servers are bunch of ladies who are the age of my grandma yet they still work instead of enjoying their last days on the beach in Florida! Or they might be young but aged dramatically due to excessive drinking, smoking, tanning etc. \nNot fun, the whole place looks like a geriatric department in a shitty hospital!\n\nFood-  Do not dare!! Makes hometown buffet taste like a gourmet 5 star meal! It's tastless, greasy & the lowest quality it can be, \nI'll prefer any airlines food over this crap!\n\nServers - Slow, rood, tired, ugly & then they just disappear.\n\nHealth - After eating 1/3 portion of eggs & meat, I had to run to the restrooms with a diarrhea & seat there for 2 hours! \nWhy am I abusing my body for eating in those kinda places???\n\nRestrooms - Similar to the ones in India, if you ever been, you probably know what I'm talking about!\nNASTY, Stinky & has lots of shit on the floor, literally.\n\nOh boy, I was happy to get back home!\n\nIf you are into white trash, red necks, old women who can't walk since their so fat that they cant carry themselves anymore, if you want your food to taste like a processed ashtray, then by all means, go for it. I would go just so I could watch this circus!\n\nBottom line, the place is a geriatric department!  \nAnd, You get what you pay for!\n\nYalla Bahhh! Yak."
1,"Roosters no longer Dirty Harry's in Mesa is up and running after a 2 year close. There are great fun loving new owners, Steve & Cherie. Live bands scheduled are every weekend, 5 or 6  large flatscreen TVs for the sport enthusiast, pool tables are newly covered, and they have some of the the best bartenders in town. Come down to see some old faces and meet new ones!!! Lets give them some great new opening support!! Go ROOSTERS! Much success, Love u guys, Jerry & Linda"
1,The four of us stopped in to share a pizza a get a few drinks before heading to another restaurant.  The pizza was really good and fresh.  The service was friendly and the drinks were good also.
1,Good quality pork fried dumpling and mongo beef.  Bar service was fast and Efficent.   Good value.  Not a 5 cause dragon eye tea was cold first time around and beef had minor amount of fat.   Fortune was even Postive!
0,"One word- HORRIFIC! Where do I even begin??? Ok, here goes nothing....\n\nI stopped in Las Vegas for two days on my road trip across the country and excalibur had such a good rate I thought it was a no-brainer to book here. It's a pretty well-known name and I always thought it looked cool... until I checked in. The room is pretty spacious, room is BEYOND out-dated! I mean, my parents have furniture from the 80's that can put this furniture to shame! The carpet, covers and upholstery looks like it's from the medieval times themselves!! Despite all this, I was still just happy to be out of the car and in Vegas... until I turned down the blanket. God only knows what kind of fluids left those stains! I was absolutely horrified so I went downstairs and asked to change rooms or pay to upgrade to a better room. The guy behond the desk then rambled on this paragraph that I'm sure he has to say 100 times a night about how we can't change rooms tonight and when I asked if we could upgrade our second night in advance, he wouldn't let me do that either. I then asked him for fresh linens so I can atleast TRY to sleep on this disgusting bed and he looked at me like I was stupid and told me he \""I can't just GIVE you sheets\"". I fled the scene before I strangled the man, walked the mile to where I had to park my car, dug my pillow and throw blanket out of the bottom of my trunk and sucked it up. Needless to say, I will never be staying here again, nor will I be giving them any of my business!\n\nTotal list of disgusting features:\nPeeling wall paper, stained wall paper, stained blankets, hairs in my bed and on my pillow, loud ac/heater, broken bathroom appliances, nasty mildew-filled shower floor, broken chairs, NO internet like they said would be here, LOUD rooms, and theres only 1 lock so housekeeping can enter at all times, you can't chain it.\n\nAll in all, a pretty horrible experience."
0,"The Golden Nugget is an older hotel/casino on the Fremont Street area in Vegas.  The parking garage was pretty easy to find, with lots of entrance signs.  It's free to park if you're staying at the Nugget but strangely costs to park there otherwise.  Check in was pretty simple but with my room in the Carson Tower it was a pretty long haul from the reception desk to the room.  The room was pretty large and nice in appearance but had some flaws upon examination.  \n- No fridge.  \n- No free coffeemaker.  \nThe bed was large and the room was non-smoking but I wasn't able to reserve those things when I made the reservation, I had to wait until check in to actually know that I'd get a non-smoking room.  Pretty lame, in this day and age.  \n\nThe bathroom was good sized and pretty modern.  TV was large flat screen but the remote was cantankerous.  The alarm clock was way too complicated, never did figure that thing out.  \n\nPlus: the hotel was pretty quiet during my stay, most smaller hotels seem to be very noisy but this building wasn't.  \n\nFor the money, I'd rather stay on the Strip or I'd expect a better room that isn't on the 18th floor."
0,"I have been a member for over two years. I used to be in love with this place and go practice religiously but now things have definitely changed....for the worst! Most instructors that I love have quit or been let go in the recent months due to their pays being cut or other personal issues with the owner King, showers are disgusting and never any soap now, there are tacky hand written signs to tip instructors $2-$3 per class, the schedule is definitely not what it is used to be. The owner has been greedy and selfish & careless towards his staff and especially the members that paid to attend! My contract ends in a couple months....and I will NOT renew. I have recommend this place to so many friends and co-workers & absolutely regret it. I feel terrible for all the people who I refereed that purchased year contracts!!! It WAS an amazing place :("
0,"Rooms:  The rooms are fine (we had a \""two bedroom\"" which is one real bedroom suite and one smaller room with a Murphy bed, connected via doors similar to connecting rooms in a hotel).  There is a small kitchen in the suite, and a tiny kitchenette (mini-fridge, sink, microwave, and coffee maker) with the Murphy bed.  The finishings were not luxurious, but we weren't expecting luxury.  It was a nice room for the price.  \n\nPool:  Rooftop and about the size of a bathtub. \n\nLocation:  We were told it was \""off strip\"" but were pleasantly surprised to find that it is right near Planet Hollywood.  It was much more convenient than I had expected, and there are several convenience stores a few buildings away.  I think there is a grocery store nearby, but we didn't look for it... no one wanted to cook!\n\nOther:  We were guests of a timeshare owner, and my husband and I thought we'd sit through a presentation for a $100 giftcard.  This was a terrible decision.  No one \""pre-qualified\"" us (meaning that no one had us sign a form stating that we were married and both partners were present and that we have an income in excess of $60k/year), and in the middle of the presentation we were told very loudly, in front of many other  people, that we \""did not qualify\"" and that we \""were not eligible\"" to sit through the presentation.  So after some headache, we got that sorted out and got a new salesman, who was really nice... until he started to regale us with tales of his animal abuse!  It was a truly strange and awful experience.  Needless to say, we left without buying.  If this is how they treat potential buyers, I would hate to see how they would treat an owner with a problem!  \n\nOverall:  The rooms were fine but the customer service was appalling."
0,I didn't think it was even as good as most of the chains as far as the filet went.\n  My wife did like the rainbow roll though.\nI would not come back.
1,"Excellent.  Been here on three different trips now.  The food is varied -- it's hard to choose! -- but uniformly excellent.  Big portions -- once we took lunch back to the Vdara and basically had it again (happily!) for dinner.  Everything has been great, and don't fear ordering the basic stuff, like the extra-long chili dog."
0,"I felt that this place was overpriced for less than average Indian food. What sets this place apart the most is the absolutely horrible service. I tried it three times. I try to always do that if I feel that there might be something I miss on the first or second time at a restaurant. I kept hoping maybe it was a single server...then two...when it hit three separate poor servers, I was done. The food is merely okay for the price paid-the service ensures I won't return. Long waits at the door (with open tables visible), attitude and exceptionally long waits for orders placed are why I give it 1 star. In addition, it's like a cave inside."
0,"Poor customer service! I was told 15 minutes for my personal pizza, it has been 30 minutes and still nothing. I remember why I do not come here. The wait is too much. Best to place an order literally an hour before you get hungry. Let's hope this is worth the wait."
0,You will freeze to death!  The heating didn't work.  We complained. They said it would get fixed. Still no heat in our room after two nights. Third night we demanded another room. The ssme issue in the new room.  No heat.  The nights get cold in the winter here. Don't stay in this hotel unless you are looking for freezing cold rooms! Terrible. The water is not hot either.  The interior is outdated.
0,Not impressed. The prices here seem to keep going up and up and nothing changes in the store design or layout. Seems dated. Produce could use a makeover.\n\n8 out of 10 times I will drive all the way to Madison to another store.
0,"A hotel well past its prime. It needs a major face lift. It has the feel of an old Holiday Inn, but it's a Hilton. \n\nThe construction is shoddy. The hallway floor changes levels. You can see the joists of the outer walls of the hotel in the elevator lobbies. CLASSY, lemme tell ya. The entire place has that musty hotel smell (I noticed in Las Vegas there are two classes of hotel, those that smell like hotels, and those that don't). The rugs are shoddy. It's far away from everything on the strip. The buffet is GAWD AWFUL.  In fact, I'd go so far as to say that whole back wing of the hotel is depressing. The lighting is bad old age home commissary-cum-trailer park/truck stop/diner.  You will be surprised to find that Ken-LRation is not on the menu. It just tastes like  it.\n\nAvoid this hotel unless none of the above bothers you. \n\nOh, and they fleece you left and right. $14.99 PER DAY for wireless with no option for cheaper multi-day plan. \n\nThe more I think about this place, the angrier I get.  STAY AWAY. Two stars is generous."
1,"Being so close to the sea, Portobello is obviously going to have a fair few fish and chips shops to choose from and this is a good one to go for and located on Portobello High Street, it is only a couple of hundred metres from the beach front.\n I have been here twice and the chips are always really tasty and the portions pretty good. The batter on the haddock can be a bit greasy but it provides good value for money. \nThe restaurant itself is very spacious and you get plenty of room to be comfortable in your surroundings if you choose to eat in. The restaurant does not only do fish and chips, but also kebabs, pizzas and baked potatos, so will cater for most people's tastes. The place also offers a delivery service if you can't bring yourself to go there in person."
0,Waited two hours for a big party. Waited another 30 minutes for the food.  The food was okay but definitely not worth the wait.  La Parilla  Suiza is much better!
1,"I have been coming here my whole life and it is one of those places that you will always remember.  It has changed very little in the last 30 years except I think it has had a few different owners.  Nick's is a classic Greek diner with nicer dinner options (steak, fish fry, a few Greek dishes, etc).  The food is always solid and straight down the middle.  I always have the basics (burger or a turkey sandwich) and they are totally fine.  Nick's feels like you stepped back into the 50s and I appreciate that the owners decided to keep alive what is one of the coolest interiors in the US."
0,Would have given this place 5 stars until I overheard the two Vietnamese girls talk crap about the patrons in the shop. There is a shorter one with a nose ring and the other heavier girl with blonde highlights. There are only two Vietnamese girls in the shop. They call people fat and talk about the little tip clients give them. I tipped Eve (awesome I love her) $10 everytime which I thought was good but the two crap talking girls said it was too low. Geeez talk about ungrateful and ugly...
0,Have been coming here since they opened.  The last six months or so something has changed.\n\nThe quality of the food and service has suffered.\n\nOne time I was meeting a friend for lunch and had to call the manager out to the dining area because the music was so loud we couldn't carry on a conversation.\n\nAnother two times the rice was under cooked.\n\nPortion size is way down.\n\nEmployees back talk you when you ask to have a kids meal made a particular way due to a finicky eating child.\n\nI think I'll start driving out to the Chandler mall location.
1,"Stopped by here for a quick lunch this week and man was it busy here! I didn't have to wait for a table but a lot of people that came afterwards had to wait about 10 min for one to clear up, so if it's during peak meal time, don't be in a hurry if you decide to stop by! \n\nI've been craving pad thai all week and decided to try theirs because of their name - Thai Style Noodle House. The noodles were good, a little thinner than I'm used to but delicious with a nice sweet flavor and were served with a side of raw/fresh bean sprouts which were a nice compliment to the noodles. The pad thai w/ pork was super cheap at $6.95! Wow, what a deal! I will definitely be coming back for more pad thai as well as to try some of their other dishes when I have more time!\n\nService was ok because they were so busy it seemed like the 2 waitresses were overwhelmed most of the time I was there. At the end I wanted to leave so I ended up just handing them 10 bucks as I was starting to get up to go, even though I hadn't gotten my bill yet. Again, don't come here if you're in a hurry...did I cover that enough in this review?"
1,"I love the Mandalay Bay atmosphere. I think this is a common theme in hotels at the end of the strip (think Wynn) that has EVERYTHING so you don't have to leave and the fact that it's far doesn't phase you so much. \n\nFirst, restaurant wise, Mandalay bay is packed with so much good food. They have three Michelin star recipient restaurants and although some of them were over-hyped, most are quite delicious. The variety is astonishing for one little hotel / casino. The casino area is also very large and has everything from $10 tables and $0.01 slots to $100 tables. If anything, you can always take the tram to the nearby Luxor and Excalibur to find even cheaper tables since its so convenient to do so.\n\nThe interior is nice, and the atmosphere is pleasant. They have an awesome pool area / Mandalay Beach and THEhotel is posh and overflowing with understated elegance. There are also a variety of shops to keep your shopping juices going and a Fat Tuesday to keep the alcohol flowing. There is so much to do you won't want to leave!"
1,"Everytime i go to Vegas, i go to this place for sure. These are the best tacos ever. Im from Mexico and they have the closest flavors and looks from the original tacos in Mexico.\n\nYou can choose from too many different meats: asada,adobada,lengua,chorizo,tripa,sesos. I usually order adobada tacos,they're the best from my point of view.\n I also order a Vampiro, its like a quesadilla stuffed with carne asada, highly recommendable. They offer free grilled onions and chilli peppers. I also get\n horchata its ok and not that sweet.\n\nIf you go to Vegas,this place its a must go. Its very affordable,opens after hours \nand closes at 4 am in the morning.Tacos are just $2 dlls.....and they are worth it!!!!"
1,"Good food.  Good drinks.  And it's L.O.U.D.\n\nSure it's considered a nightclub, but we really weren't there during nightclub hours.  It was happy hour for us, so we stayed in the bar area were the seats were ample and spacious and despite it looking crowded from the outside doors, there definitely was more than enough room inside.  I mean, the space is HUGE....which I guess makes sense if this is also a nightclub.\n\nComing from New York, the prices were comparable, but generally, still pricey.  They offered a good slew of food items on the bar menu, which was great since one of us was a vegeterian (eggplant parm was yummay).  The drinks were great, though I did wish they had some kind of happy hour special.  Then again, this is Vegas so who am I kidding.\n\nLike most bars/nighclubs, the ambience was dark and loud.  But for happy hour...I thought it was a bit too dark and too loud.  You definitely should not go hear if you intend to have any kind of conversation.  Well, maybe not inside the bar/restaurant space.  They apparently have some nice tables, couches outside that would probably be more conducive to conversing.  But it was a bit too cool that night (they do have heating lamps outside) and those areas were already taken.\n\nDespite it's eardrum pounding noise, I definitely would go back with friends looking to drink and have a good time.  Maybe even dress up a little bit, as business casual attire didn't seem to cut it in this particular atmosphere.  I would even consider coming a bit earlier to check out the restaurant aspect as well.  You figure if the bar food was great, the actual entrees must be awesome."
0,"Which sewer are the using to farm raise the lobster they serve? If I could give zero stars I would. I was so excited to find out about a lobster roll place in Las Vegas. Spent $110 to try a few things with family. All the lobster was bland despite the butter and mayo. This is not Maine lobster. Tilapia would have been more flavorful. Order came out wrong and instead of making a fresh Connecticut roll they just poured butter on top of the Maine roll. Disgusting, expensive. I left there feeling nauseous."
1,"It's your typical chain coffee shop inside of a casino. This time, the chain is the venerable but fading Coffee Bean and Tea Leaf, and the casino is The Palms. Stopped here for a cup before a concert at The Pearl. Coffee was fine. I have a hard time giving a place more than three stars for a cup of coffee, but I'll give them an extra star for the good folks at The Pearl allowing me to bring my coffee into the venue."
0,Dirty....
0,"I've been here are couple of times. Food is good and service is kind of disorganized. There are so many tables and not enough staff. They aren't really attentive when you need the check. \n\nAlso I stopped going after an incident in the bathroom. One of the waitresses came out of the stall while I was heading in and she didn't even wash her hands! Talk about disgusting. And yes, she used the bathroom, flushed the toilet, but did not wash her hands before leaving.... Never went back. It's been about 4 or 5 months since I've eating there."
0,"Horrible customer service! I went in there and there was only one person working and he was talking to another customer. The employee did not acknowledge me at all while I walked around for five minutes and then I left. While walking out the door, the employee said have a nice day. The sad thing is I am a customer looking for R/C car parts and batteries. I guess I won't be purchasing anything from this store."
1,"i come here for sunday morning breakfast.  the food is good, service is hit or miss depending on what server you get,  they need to have a more consistent service.  the food is always good,  not the best breakfast in town, but the place has small town charm, which makes up for alot in this town.  wish they had real plates, not that plastic melamine stuff,  and the prices are very fair,  alot cheaper then alot of other places. check it out!!!"
0,"I truly love Indian food and I wanted to like this place more, but I ultimately couldn't. I wound up at the lunch buffet and didn't think too much of it. The dishes at the buffet really lacked the oomph that I am so used to at Indian restaurants, and unless the pot was personally stirred, some of the dishes were room temperature. As far as pricing, it wasn't too bad; it was just around $10. \n\nAfter reading other reviews (Mainly Lisa O's) I would consider trying this place after the buffet is put away. But until then, I'll probably just be staying away."
0,"The view was great. Not a huge selection on menu. Food was just okay, nothing to rave about."
1,"My favorite place of all time. The Duce serves great hand crafted vintage cocktails and has so many fun things to do - cornhole, shuffle board, dance floor, etc! This place is always chill and never too crowded with fun friendly customers and staff! Nestled right downtown with a few nice skyline views! The Duce is the way to go if you are into something a little different and less snooty than Scottsdale bars."
1,"Having the breakfast special. which come with two eggs, pancakes or toast, potatoes or has brown, and link sausage or turkey patty for $4.99 Not bad for a deal that's a lot of food!"

0,"6 mos later and still NO shutters! have finally contacted the registrar of contractors since the BBB is NOT an enforcement agency. Shuttercrafters wanted to discount my shutters and for me to pick them up and install them myself which will void my warranty and not guarantee me that these will actuallyt fit. I just remodeled my entire home, dealt with over 11 different contractors over the past 8 mos and not one has even come close to the unprofessionalism and thievery that Shuttercrafters has!  This company has robbed me out of $1000 and left me high and dry!"
1,I love this place!  I've been diving head first into sewing for a few months now.  The ladies there all know me and are very friendly.  \nIt's like a treasure hunt every time I go.  The fabrics are fairly organized by type but you never know what you might find.  I highly recommend hunting the whole store when you go just to make sure you don't miss something new and exciting!
0,"I have been shopping at Target stores for many many years now, and this is by far the worst location I've ever had the displeasure of visiting!\n\nI usually only shop at the Target close to my house off of Flamingo and Grand Canyon.  But I was shopping there for a certain piece of workout gear and they didn't have my size in stock.  So I called this location and after getting juggled between multiple employees over a 10 minute period I finally got someone to confirm that they not only had my size, but they had plenty of them.  So I decided to make the 10 or so minute drive up to get the item.\n\nUpon arriving, I walk into what I would call one dirty, horribly unorganized store.  It looked like the carpet hadn't been vacuumed in a long ass time.  There are clothes just laying on the dirty floor off of the racks.  I am already not impressed with this place and it's only been 30 seconds.  I start walking to where I'm assuming the men's clothing section is.  I do a full circle and still haven't found it.  I finally see an employee and ask them where it is and they point behind a wall that I was figuring was the back of the store, but it's actually just some stupid divider.  \n\nI scan all the racks twice and not only do I not see my size that was promised was here, but they don't even have the item stocked.  Not even one ugly color in the wrong size.  They don't have shit!  So I track down another employee which took about 10 minutes and tell them that I called and was assured the item was here.  They look with me for a minute or so and say \""Yeah, guess not\"" and walk away.  \n\nSo needless to say this was a wasted trip!  A waste of gas and a waste of about an hour of my time.\n\nSo while I'm still a fan of Target in general...fuck this location!"
1,"Ahhh, welcome back into the good graces of this Yelper. Without the pesky issues of a distracted waiter and high dinner prices, my craving for this version of chicken parmesan, turned out a success. It was the same sandwich I encountered on my first take-out visit here and it once again was loaded with thin cutlets and a solid hero roll on this occasion. The pasta salad was still tasty and despite me trying to save half the sandwich for later, it is pretty impossible to have that sort of will power when it comes to the Chicken parm takeout at Brioni's."
1,Dr. Sura and her staff are the best.  I have been taking my dog there for years.  The prices are reasonable and I can always get an appointment when I need one.  I do participate in the wellness plan because it is a good deal if you take your pet for regular health care.  It also saves you money if your pet requires prescription food.  Most of all Dr. Sura discovered a cancerous tumor in my dog and because of her quick action she made a quick recovery and is still cancer free one year later.  I highly recommend Family Pet Hospital.
1,"We stopped by for their delicious all-you-can-eat buffet brunch. The atmosphere is bright and comfortable. Their service is friendly and prompt.\n\nThe portions are small, but that just makes it possible to try the many different delicious plates they have to offer. I had the steak and eggs, surf and turf benedict, chicken and waffles, and poached egg with corn beef hash. Every dish was really tasty. \n\nTheir regular lunch menu is a tad expensive, but their brunch buffet is definitely worth it."
1,"Ancient Creations is a phenomenal place to visit at the Venetian. \n\nTheir collection and historical information blows the mind. \n\nI was specifically interested in the Alexander the Great pieces as well the Atocha coins they had. \n\nAll of it real, all of it legit, and an amazing gem of a store as staff."
0,"This was the first nice dinner we had in Vegas and I was not impressed. I felt the menu was a bot limited and the food was bland. How can cajun food be bland?! The service was on par and the waiter was very attentive.  I had the fisherman's stew and it lacked flavor. The jambalaya was better, but kind of dry and even though it was a side it could have been an entree with such a large portion. My friends had the salmon and seemed to enjoy it much better than I enjoyed mine. I probably wouldn't go back again. It wasn't worth the money, in my opinion."
1,"Excellent food, unique cocktails & friendly attentive service!  Friends recommended this new restaurant since it was a pleasant evening for dinner on the patio!\n\nWe started with deviled eggs & hummus plate. All was unique and tasty! Pickled veggies on the hummus plate were delicious and crunchy! Oh the cheese scones were warm with crispy outside and tender center along with soft butter - they were melt in your mouth scrumptious!\n\nSince I had read the mac & cheese was fabulous, I knew in the back of my mind I had to have it! So I opted for it and drunken mussels. Neither disappointed although I would have enjoyed more grilled bread with it. Delicious!!  My husband had the sliders which he said were pretty good. Friends got fries (which were wonderful, great seasoning) and another got brie stuffed hen.  \n\nStaff ensured we had full water glasses, wine was flowing, and all were friendly & attentive!  I can't wait to try it again and will probably get the farro risotto! I'm also anxious to try their sister lunch place, The Mayo Bird!"
0,Beer selection was just ok. Chicken drum app was good.  Shrimp cocktail looked like it came from a frozen ring you get at the supermarket. When the fried chicken and waffle salad came out undercooked I was so excited that I could send that awful thing back without having to say I was disappointed and the ranch dressing was sour. I wanted to try something new but it was not good. The few pieces of waffles were hard and small like cereal. They offered dessert since I did not want to try anything else. Dessert was ok. They serve mini milkshakes with each one they were good. The pecan dessert was the best. The chocolate cake tasted like old cold store bought cake. They also gave a key lime ripe of cake that they should be embarrassed to serve. I love that type if dessert but it was bad!   Don't waste your time here there are plenty if excellent restaurants on Vegas. I love to find out and this was not cheap and not very good. I was do excited to try a Michael Mina restaurant and now I don't want to try another one. Ill end on a positive note by saying the staff was very friendly and accommodating.
1,"I know Shady's loves me!. An excellent choice of spirits, beers and smartass bartenders that are masters of hilarious attitude make this place a hit. The back room makes it a lot easier to get a seat, and the ever present rose guy that won't take no for an answer also makes this a place I enjoy frequenting. Shady's takes many of the best parts of a pretentious cocktail bar and blends it with the joys of your local pub, the result is blend that works well. It's enough to make you want to live in the neighborhood and I do, so there !!!!...\n\nI don't know what it is, but most of the time I come here I end up leaving so drunk that I'm not sure what I did the night before or how I managed to get back to my car to sleep it all off before heading home (you'll find me in various places sleeping off the effects of this place.)\n\n\nOne thing that does irk me -  it's difficult to sit down at the bar at times. I hate walking by and realizing that there's no room. That situation, however, is how I met \""No really, I'm straight, I have a boyfriend\"" girl who one drink later was asking for my digits. \n\nShady's I think I'm in love w/ you."
1,Rokerij is our sunday brunch spot for $5 mimosas. $5 make you hola.
0,"I'm not sure if they finished renovating this place. We have spots where they were missing paint, AC not fully working on a hot summer day, and the overall decor looked half assed. \n\nBut that's not what I really came for. Just a good bowl of fresh noodles in that rich rich broth. What I got was neither. The ordered the #2 which was noodles with beef stew. The noodle lacked any real bite to it, the beef stew was more sliced beef rounds with zero flavor, and the soup tasted like a vegetable broth without any real color. Was quite disappointed especially considering all the other rave reviews of this place. \n\nMy friends ordered the dry noodles with the meat sauce and said it was banging. I had a bite of theirs and felt like they were just super hungy and trying to make me feel bad for ordering the wrong dish. Either way...I don't think I'll be back."
1,"I noticed this shiny new Chili's on a recent trip to the Aria.  I LOVE a good buffalo chicken salad so I was pretty excited, but with so many great restaurants in the area, I figured I'd save my Chili's fix for the O'Hare airport (my favorite homecoming treat).\n\nOne morning/afternoon, after a really fun night out, I found the big red chili pepper, like a beacon in the night, calling me across the street for some 1000 calorie salad goodness.  I wanted to zip over real quick, pick up take out, and come right back to my room.  I have had the Chili's app on my phone for awhile in hopes that one of the O'Hare airport Chili's would let me order from the plane but no luck with that yet.  Fortunately, this Chili's allows you to order from the app.  It worked out great, I even got to customize my order and add avocado!  It's the little things.\n\nI headed out the door about 10 minutes before my order was due to be ready.  After all, this place is right across the street.  Plenty of time.  Upon reaching the end of the Aria drive, though, my fears were realized when I saw that I couldn't cross the street without traveling a couple of blocks in either direction down the Strip.  Obviously, this was crushing news in the blinding daylight and 101 degree heat.  About 20 minutes later  (I may be exaggerating) I finally reached my oasis.\n\nI found the stairway off to the side and headed up to the second floor location.  The interior is really nice.  It's open, spacious, and bright with tons of TVs around the bar.  I guess I never really eat inside of a Chili's so I didn't realize that they have touch screen ordering devices on the table.  You can order when you're ready while watching a game on one of the TVs at the bar...which you can totally see from your table.  It actually seems like a pretty cool place to hang out.\n\nNo one was staffing the take out area so I spoke with one of the hostesses.  It seems that there was some kind of mix up with my order so it took a bit of back and forth between the hostess and a guy who seemed like he might be a manager.  When they finally found the order, the register wasn't working so they had to process my payment in the back somewhere.  It was no big deal, though, the staff was all super friendly and apologetic.  The manager even threw in a ridiculous amount of ranch dressing (I have a problem, I know) because I mentioned that I like extra ranch.\n\nWhen I finally got my salad back to the room, it was beautifully packaged and the presentation was nice.  Unfortunately, it was SUPER salty.  I figure that they're still working out the kinks at this new location.  A little salt isn't enough to keep me away from this place.  I'm glad Chili's made its way to this new location."
0,"So so so disappointed...I think I cook Korean food better than this place... and I can't cook to save my life. \n\n1. The tang soo yuk - wow.. the meat was overfried in overused old oil and it was barely edible. My brothers and I ate it just for the sake of eating because we were super hungry. The batter was so doughy and got stuck in our teeth and stuff.\n2. I got the soondoobu - too much MSG. It was so oily. ( .) The tofu was all broken up so it was hardly tofu. It was basically soup, zucchini pieces, and kimchi pieces.\n3. My dad and brother got the kalbi tang. The flavor was basically pepper and there was hardly any meat. \n4. My other brother got the udon. I didn't taste it, but the noodles looked slightly off-colored.. \n\nYeah, so sad the food was disappointing. We stopped by on our drive down to South Carolina and yeah, it was just no good."
1,"Wow...amazing. We went here not knowing what we were getting into, I had heard of the main restaurant but not this one and boy was I glad we went here. \n\nWe got a few different dishes:\nSmoked Salmon with potato cake - The best smoked salmon I have ever had, no joke, so smooth, it just melts in your mouth. The potato cake was delicious, it went so well with the smoked salmon and dill creme fraiche, the three together were just fantastic.\nLangosten - Lovely, perfectly cooked, so tender and flavorful, lightly fried so the little crunch was great.\nCheese taster plate - So good, I love cheese and these cheeses were amazing. A goat, a blue, and a few others, they were just so good I can't even tell you.\nOnion Tart - Good things come in small packages, this small tart is just that - so flavorful and the onion is just cooked to its peak, wonderful.\nPlus Drinks \n\nThe service was exceptional. We sat at the \""counter\"" where they serve you from behind it and they were really great about everything, explained every dish with such enthusiasm and detail that it made it a much more sensory experience, not just sight, smell, taste, all of them, it was great.\n\nEat here!"
0,This food sucks. I would rather spend 20 cents on ramen noodles because I would end up happier. Even when a coworker drags you here just pass on putting any of this in your mouth. No matter how hungry you are!
1,"Sprouts has become by go to place for produce, and recently their meat department as well.   The produce you can get great prices on, but unfortunately you have to watch their ads and play that silly game.  Why not just price it flat and blow the competitors out of the water permanently?   When's the last time you saw the produce aisle at Safeway full?  Come on.  That keeps you from 5-stars.\n\nThe meat department can be tricky too, although the sausages that they make their are fantastic!  Deli sandwiches are really inexpensive and pretty good.  Again you have to watch their prices games, but lately I have given this part of the store a quick look when I stop in as well."
0,"Not so much....  \nI also had green curry, which I have had 200 times at other places.  It did not taste right.  I went there yesterday and I'm still cringing today.  \nIt might just be what I ordered, but Thai places should absolutely be judged by the curry... it's a staple... it's what a lot of people order."
1,"I have heard wonderful things about Culinary Dropout, so my husband and I were super excited to try it with some friends.  I ordered the fried chicken - now, I have to say, I am a Kentucky girl.  I know my fried chicken.  I haven't had awesome fried chicken since I moved out of Kentucky almost a year ago.  Culinary Dropout has ahhhhhmazing fried chicken.  The prices are a bit high, but the food is delicious.  My meal came with three pieces of chicken (a leg, breast & thigh), coleslaw, mashed potatoes & a honey biscuit - for $22.  \n\nThe restaurant, itself is beautifully decorated.  There is an open patio section with cool fire pit tables.  (My description is terrible - go see for yourself!).  I'm a professional photographer & would looove to shoot inside this place.  It's so cool.  The staff was very nice and our waitress held herself together well when some douche grabbed her butt while she was taking his order.  For me, the music was a bit loud.  We could barely hear our friends talking, so it's not great for conversation.  & the only other downside is that it's in the Hard Rock, which is quite possibly the douchiest place in Las Vegas.  We dodged about 10 Bachelor parties and a gaggle of obnoxious drunk girls (at 5:30 in the afternoon - I know this is Vegas, but geez...at least wait until after dark to be so drunk you can't walk.) just getting to the actual restaurant.\n\nGo.  Eat.  Dodge drunk guys.  Be happy."
1,"After a trip to the Adventuredome in Circus Circus, we were desperate to find a good place to eat. We saw this little pizzeria on our way in, so stopped in on our way out. Gets a bit crowded so I recommend snagging a table as soon as you get there. They will stop taking dine in orders if the dining room is full-take out only.\n\nPizza is so delicious. Well-made and tasty. We ordered some bread sticks, pepperoni pizza along with a couple beers and enjoyed a nice dinner with the family. While we were waiting for our food, we were able to let our older kids wander to Circus Circus arcade area and check it out--it was nearby. Wait time was about 30 minutes but we were told about it when we ordered, so it was ok.\n\nThey also offer wait staff, which is great. They bring out your food, bring you utensils/plates and bus your table throughout. I was very pleased with our experience here and highly recommend."
1,"A friend of mine absolutely loves this place and convinced me to go with her. She said her favorite item is the Macedonia.  She said everything is good and recommended what we will have on our next visit. The Macedonia was very good - sweet and fruity. When I was little my great grandmother used to make me what she called a barnyard soda - which is a Pepsi float with vanilla ice cream. This reminded me of that, but all fruit instead of soda. I had the strawberry ice cream scoop, she had vanilla. The drink was a mixture of mango, strawberry, pineapple and came with a spoon and a straw. \n\nWhen we arrived there were three ladies at a table, but after we arrived the place was busy. Several people stayed, but others picked up and took out. It was constantly busy during our stay. Each Macedonia was $4.95 and well worth it. It was large and I wasn't sure I could = but I carried on and we each finished ours. \n\nI felt very comfortable there and we stayed talking and enjoying our drink for over 2 hours. I will definitely come back and try more of the drinks since this is just two streets down from my apartment."
1,My hubby and I got take out and everything was delicious! They also had it ready To go once we got there which was nice. Well done and way to redeem yourselves from the last visit!
1,"I have spent many chilly and not-so-chilly nights holing up at this music venue, which became one of my favorite places in all of Madison after four years of concert-going here. Majestic Theater is a great place to see a show, and can hold its own whether hosting an acoustic, guitar-strumming session or a full-on electronic dance party. There are seats on the upper balcony but most concerts are stand-only, general admission. Majestic has more than enough room for swaying or dancing yet it still retains an intimate feel. There are two bars (one upstairs and one downstairs), but drinks are over-priced, which is typical for a music venue. Sometimes, Majestic also hosts salsa nights and other themed parties. Just writing about this is making me ache for some more Majestic memories!"
1,"Short Leash, hmmm, what can i say. If you love dogs, hot dogs and food in general, this place is the only way to go. Look them up on facebook, get heir calendar and follow them around. My wife and I love them, great food, awesome people, what else can you ask for. Price is awesome, but quality is waaaaay better. Get an awesome meal at SIT-STAY and end the week in good company. Enjoy and stay safe"
0,"Never again will I order from this place again! I called to order and asked about a dish and was told to \""go online and look at it\"" because they're \""too busy\"" to tell me over the phone.  (1st red flag)\n\nI then went online...looked up my order & called back only to the same guy who was very rude from the get-go. FYI to the owners...Sometimes it not what you say but how you say it. So then I hang up & remember I want to pay with my debit card and called back was given attitude again about not giving it to them the first time. From then I decided I will not be giving my hard earned money to a restaurant that doesn't care about how they treat their customers. \n\nI usually don't have to leave bad reviews but I will be telling everyone I know about my experience with Rainbow Garden in Urbana! I will stick  to Lai Lai's from now on.\n\nGet a nicer person to answer your phones!"
1,"I love this place.  New Era hats are buy one get one 50% off.  Jackets, pullovers, hoodies are 20% off.  Prices are very competitive, and the employees are friendly, and helpful.  No other sports apparrel retailer anywhere can offer such great deals on New Era, Nike, and Addidas.   The only downside that I see is that they don't have a huge selection, and are limited on sizes."
1,"So fun to have a place like this in the Strip.  I just found out that they have chocolate oranges - I look for these in all the stores during Christmas and never thought to come here - well they have white, milk, and dark chocolate varieties available year-round.  I love the dark chocolate, but only because I didn't know the other two kinds existed!  They also have canisters of malted milk balls, unique chocolates from all over, seasonal items, and a cafe-ish area.  I didn't try the hot chocolate, but I hear it's a must-have.\n\nWhile we walked around the small store, three different salespeople asked if we were finding everything okay - possibly because I kept taking pictures to Instagram and I didn't realize until after I left that there's a sign asking patrons not to take pictures. Ooops!  But no one said anything and they were polite, so thumbs up for the service here."
1,"Best non-Southern BBQ I've had, thinking of it makes my molars sweat."
1,"This is a good, clean place if you want some Vietnamese food.  I am not a huge fan of their pho (and I've lived in Los Angeles and San Diego where I have been exposed to amazing pho), but the rest of their food is good.  I specifically love the S5 which is the egg noodle soup with duck. I have had this dish at many other places and never has it been as good as it is here because most other places make it too sweet.  The service here is also great, and I have met the owner and his wife on several occasions and both are really great people and really care about their customers. Ingredients are always fresh such as the jalapenos and basil given on the side. And there are TVs if you want to stop by during a game that you don't want to miss."
1,"After trying to order my pizza from Dominos and being unsuccessful, I turned to Pizza Hut. They helped me right away and I ended up getting more food for less money. They also delivered my food within a half an hour and it was hot and ready to eat when I got it. The delivery guy was very friendly and warm as well. I ordered their wings for the first time today and they were super yummy. I definitely will be ordering Pizza Hut from now on and will be ordering wings from them again on the 50 cent wing night."
1,"my boyfriend and i were going to vegas for the weekend. from the moment we left california, he would not stop talking about this place. we arrived around midnight and that was the first place he wanted to go to before we even checked in to our hotel... i agreed and thought to myself, this place better be worth it because i'm crazy tired. we went through the drive thru, ordered a 6 piece caniac to share and sat in the parking lot to eat. he made me take the first bite and to my amazement... OMG! it was freakin' good! the best chicken tenders you will ever have at a fast food restaurant. the chicken is real, for one...but besides that, it is juicy and tender with the perfect amount of breading to make it crispy. \n\nneedless to say, we stopped by before we headed back to cali... raising cane's is a must try!"
0,"Went here on a Saturday night and found it surprisingly empty. Like the name states, the view is nice overlooking Tivoli Village. In house band provided great music and half off all mixed drinks was nice. \n\nAs for the food, the portions are kind of small for the price. Don't expect to order a full meal but instead more like an appetizer. My biggest issue was the delivery of the food. Like I mentioned this place was pretty empty when my group arrived. I thought like most restaurants our food would be delivered altogether. Instead plates were brought out 1 by 1 with 5-10 min between each one. There were only 4 of us and by time I received my food, my friend was already done with his mac and cheese. That made it extremely weird to have to watch others eat while you wait and then to have to have them watch you eat because they are already done. Not cool, bro! Bring all our food out at the same time. It's called knowing when to fire the food so it's all prepared and finished within the same time frame. \n\nOther than the food arriving all over the place the view was nice and so were the drinks."
1,"My favorite coffee place. The staff are awesome and the atmosphere is great too! Free wi-fi, lots of places to sit and great drinks!!"
0,I highly suggest do not eat at this place about a year ago I go into it with my napkin is a cockroach under the napkin.\n\n\nSo being the optimist that I am \n\nover year later I decide to go back and give  kaizen another chance \n\n yesterday ordered a couple rolls only to find out to wake up four hours later with food poisoning. I \n expressed this  to several friends and come to find out several people have experienced the same situation at This restaurant I highly suggest not to eat at this establishment anymore due to improper handling the food & storage!!
1,This is by far my favorite Brewery in AZ. Food is good and I love the atmosphere and Beer is wonderfull!! What more can you ask for a Brewery! They serve good beer and you just enjoy!!!
0,"I found it ironic that there was a store called \""Relics - Fossils and Rocks\"" in here.  That's essentially what this place is.\n\nSadly, it's gone the way of the Grand Ave. Mall in Milwaukee, with no large scale stores other than TJ Maxx (which is actually pretty decent), and only one other real draw in the Wisconsin Sportswear for WI team apparel.\n\nIt's too bad, as this place isn't that far from a few decent restaurants and stand alone stores.  Maybe they can lease it out for a zombie movie?"
0,"We went there on a Sat night at 6:15 and it was half empty and I now understand why. The food was average. The Brussel sprouts that everyone raves about were burnt with little or no bacon or sauce. Because the service was so slow we did not have time to send them back. We were seated at 6:00 for a 6:15 reservation. We ordered our drinks and food as when the server appeared. However at about 7:20 we had to ask for our entrees. We barely made it to an 8:00 show on time. Even getting the check took a very long time.  Overall, average food at a high price with very poor service."
1,"What a fun time we had..the music and singing over the top, I was entertained from beginning to end ..some of\nThe most talented singers I've heard in a long time..."
0,"I came here with some friends, and was utterly disappointed. I ordered the fajitas, and the meat was limited. I had 15 pitas but 8 pieces of meat, a little cup of guacamole, and lots of onions. What is that? \n\nThe service was slow, it took 10 minutes for the waiter to collect payment, but took less then a minute to bring the bill."
1,"Stumbled upon Zucca one night when walking over to the Traverse. At the time, the boy and I looked at the menu, looked at each other and promptly decided 'Valentines'. The menu had plenty options for meat, fish and vegetarian eaters alike, it was hard to pick really what I wanted to try first!\n\nFor Valentines itself, there was a set menu for 28 quid (3 courses). This little cafe/restaurant had their delivery down pat. Although clearly preprepared, the food was of such high quality you could forgive them for working round what is such a high turnover night for restaurants. The waiting staff (or at least the lady who served us) were discreet, and efficient, allowing us time between courses to pause but not to start to wander. \n\nTo the meal: as we sat down, my eye was immediately drawn to the table arrangement. Now, I don't normally comment, but on the table was a little tray of salt, pepper and oil with just the smallest dab of balsamic vinegar. It almost looked like a work of art in itself to match the flower arrangement and candle. \n\nAs it was Valentines day, I treated myself as the non driver of the night to a Valentines cocktail, a martini-based strawberry infused concoction, with (I swear) a hint of herb - basil? Might have imagined it, but it was a delicious aperitif to start the evening. I followed it up with a large glass of Nero D'Avolo, more of an acquired taste, which arrived the further I travelled down the glass. The boy tucked into a rose prosecco, which was like a trail of bubbly lava going down the throat. \n\nTo the food - for starters, I had roasted Mediterranean vegetables with rocket while the boy had wild mushroom tart. I think this was the only time I felt a pang of regret for the preparation style as the vegetables were refrigerator-cold, where I expected them to be even a little warm still. Nonetheless, great texture, great flavour, and the mushroom tart tasted lovely as well, although the pastry was a little hard for the boys taste (re-warmed, we suspected). \n\nWe also tucked into warm rosemary foccacia (oh, so, so rosemary good, I haven't eaten bread this delicious in a while) and olives while we waited for our starter and took the opportunity to mop up olive soaked oil as well as the balsamic-dipped oil that had so caught my eye earlier. \n\nAnyway, back to the main course, where I had a beautifully cooked piece of salmon, resting on top of a spring onion potato cake (you know that goosebump feeling you get when you tuck into slowly cooked, caramelised onions - well, this one would have had you at your knees) and sauteed spinach surrounded by a lake of creamy herb sauce. The boy had ribeye steak in a green peppercorn sauce that in his words, melted in the mouth and he had never had a steak cooked so well. My my, strong words, but I believed him. A side of garlic foccacia bread had us stuffed to the gunnels, but in such a satisfied way.\n\nFinally, we both had the passionfruit sorbet as a light finish to a sumptious meal. I was expecting something sweet, but this sorbet was sharp as they come and super, super cold, having also been pre-prepared (frozen strawberries at the bottom were a giveaway). Doused with prosecco, it was a welcome accompaniment to the sharp sorbet.\n\nSo in summary, Zucca, you are sharp as they come. Highly recommended and definitely glad we chose you for our meal last night."
0,"Delicious food, appalling service. Waiter got the order wrong and left half of it off with no apologies. Never checked on us, drinks went dry. For such an expensive restaurant (which means huge tip) I expected a lot more. In fact somebody did come over to apologize for the delay on the food, but it wasn't our waiter. He never even acknowledged any of the mistakes! That's too bad, because the food was delicious."
0,"I will never go to this BWW again. The service is slow, and the staff is rude. They forgot to put half my items in the bag for my take out. The person on the phone was rude and too busy to even try to make the situation right. So my wife got cold take out, and I had to go somewhere else for my dinner.  Thanks for hanging up on me. You lost a consistent customer."
0,Everyone should eat here if they want to get really bad Food Poisoning and almost die!!!!
1,Great lunch specials!
1,I went to wing Wednesday which is all-you-can-eat wings for $12.99and even though they raise the prices it's still really great deal. You can eat as many wings you want to get all the different flavors and have a good time enjoying the atmosphere. The girls are smoking hot! All the types of sauces are awesome! And I had at least 25 wings in one sitting. I would definitely go again just not every Wednesday maybe once a month.
1,"Another great visit here. Had the sage chicken and waffles. They were amazing would definitely get them again. Also had the special Andy's grill which had boneless steak, venison sausage, and duck breast. All were incredible."
1,"After a rocky start this AM when someone came into our room at 6:45 AM the assistant Front Desk manager, Robert S, a customer service superstar upgraded us to a bigger better suite in response and sincerely apologized - we had a stellar day at the pool and then at the Blackjack tables! \nStarting to love New York New York Las \nVegas again."
1,"Earl of Sandwich is a great place not only because of the food, but because of the people that work there too.  \n\nAfter my not so stellar experience at Earl of Sandwich, they contacted me to apologize and encouraged me to come back. \n\nI did, and ordered the exact same sandwich - the Original. This time, you could see their assembly line running like a well oiled machine producing my order quickly, and efficiently. When I unwrapped the sandwich, steam rose out and cheese oozed from the sides. The ratio of roast beef to bread was perfect and the horseradish was generous. This is the sandwich of my memory. \n\nThank you Earl of Sandwich for doing such a great job!"
0,"I was across the street for a Dr appointment and decided to step into the AJs after to browse since it was \""right there\"". Haven't been into one in years for the same reason that I probably won't return after the recent visit: way overpriced for things I can buy elsewhere. Almost everything in the store you can buy at any regular grocery store, and pay less for it. They do carry a small number of \""gourmet\"" items on the shelves, but I can find those other places, too. \n\nSo, you'd think that their deli or bakery or something would stand out, but not that I can tell. I was going to try something from the bakery case but it was all way overpriced and totally unimpressive looking. I was there in the AM so I did try a slice of the breakfast pizza that was out in the deli. First off, it took me several minutes to be served because the staff was busily ignoring me. Then when I did finally get my slice, I went to pay and eat it, and the thing was cold and chewy. The crust was just so tough. The eggs were somewhat dried out. I was seriously underwhelmed. \n\nThe store was practically dead the whole time I was wandering around. The staff outnumbered the patrons BY FAR. How do these places stay in business? You won't get more money from me AJ's!"
1,"Had a very nice dinner here last Saturday night with my daughter and a cousin.  The service was pleasant and attentive, the seating on the patio attractive and comfortable, and the food outstanding.  My daughter and I shared a bruschetta plate, all four of which were different and delicious, and a chicken salad.  We couldn't finish the two things between us; portions are large and not overpriced at all.  The third person in our party opted for a sandwich that she thoroughly enjoyed.  The food is good, well priced, deliciously prepared....  Definitely a nice little place to go near campus...and quieter than Mill Street.  I would certainly recommend it and will be back on another visit!"
1,Biscuits and sausage gravy.  So.  Freaking.  Yum.\n\nI've been here twice and the service isn't that great which is surprising because these seem like career servers.  But the restaurant is clean and the biscuits and gravy are the second best I've ever had in my life.
1,"Could have been quicker, but people were relatable and had an wwesome sense of humor. Office was clean and clientele were sweet elderly ppl. Good environment"
1,"Its sad to see any restaurant get bad reviews but when we went, we did have to wait a bit to be seated but it was well worth the wait. The waitress was run off her feet. She was the only one there that had to be the bartender the waitress and the busser. Incredible! We ordered the Fruitti de Mer (seafood in pasta) and the Spaghetti with meat sauce. OMFG! First off the portions were generous. We got two large. And we demolished the seafood BOWL!. The spaghetti was so delicious. I have never had pasta that good before except for Anton's pasta. I'll tell you about that in another review. The sauce was exceptional. Its too bad management doesn't know diddly about staffing the restaurant properly. The food is so good I would go back regardless if I had to deal with the wait."
1,"I consider myself a regular customer. I love getting drinks here whether it's milk tea, a smoothie, slush, or a hot drink. Love the freshness of the drinks. This is my favorite place to get a fresh fruit drink!"
0,I went to the website first to  contact them and wasn't going to yelp them.  I live close by and have been here a few times.  Every single time something is messed up.  My honest opinion is that its the management.  They need to train their employees.  Some things are not common sense.  For example during todays breakfast the waitress think her name is Michelle came over and asked the girlfriend if she wanted a refill.  Because she had basically been slow the entire meal I asked for one also mine was half full.  On the way to fill it up she stops and takes an order.  Setting out drinking on a resting table.  Common sense is that when I'm eating my meal I want to have a beverage at the same time.  And I do not want to wait for you to take an order from silver hairs which predictably  took a long time to place the order so I got up and took my drink back.  No apology.  No recognition that a mistake had been made.  Maybe she didn't realize that is not the proper way to serve a table.  Tip.  When someone flags you down while you are doing a refill tell them you just have to refill the drink and you will be right back.  So maybe things aren't common sense like when you serve potatoes.  You can't mix two batches together.  One that is crispy and another one that is raw.  You actually want to try to have your food come out consistent.  They should always be cooked the same.  Customers are not very crazy about having a few raw potatoes in every bite.\n\nThis is not the first time I have had issues at this place.  It is a cute place and they do have the best Jelly I have ever had ever. So at some point in time some one knew what they where doing.  But maybe when they setup shop in Arizona they sent out someone who was not qualified to train and open new restaurants.  I would like to believe if you go to Oregon they operate better.  I wish I could remember what some of the previous issues were. But I know it has been 6 months and mistake I tried it again.\n\nThing is if they cared about doing things properly they would have feedback forms in the restaurant.  And maybe a way on the website to send a message.  I'm not going to send snail mail to the corporate office to complain.  So hopefully they read this review get better management and train their employees cooks and servers.  This could be a great restaurant with a little care and TLC.\n\nSo you are warned. It's a roll of the dice if you will have a good or bad experience.
1,"Restaurant is in basement of building, but it was quiet, clean, and brightly colored.  Loved their Chicken Curry and Lamb dish (can't remember name).  Enjoyed the tasty side of lentil salad.  Very small plates for lunch, but delicious, filling food.  Nice level of spice.  Had bottled non-alcoholic ginger beer which was very good.   Lunch partner had the unleavened bread with her entree and this bread looked like a thin, wet pancake (which I would skip.)   Pleasant young waiter.  I'll go back."
1,I was happy with this bar. Sure it wasn't what I expected. It's a tiny spot in the middle of the Casino floor...but it serves its purpose.  Amazingly good Bloody Marys and I can play videopoker at the bar while I drink.  I'm not going to complain about that.
0,The food was okay. Nothing that I would pay $20 for. But I didn't like the atmosphere. I was really bothered by the aquariums. It looked over crowded with fish. I hope someone is taking care of them because they looked really stressed.
0,"I've stayed at the Excalibur about a dozen times from childhood to now, and although it's not the cleanest and classiest hotel, it's still fun to visit. The primary reason I come to the Excalibur now is to go to the fun dungeon, but they have totally cheaped out on their games and toys. I'd rather visit Circus Circus for the games, but I still come to Excalibur for nostalgia."
0,"How can this place have nearly five stars?  The atmosphere is fine if you're looking for a casual, family friendly kind of restaurant.  The service was fast and cordial, but the pizza left so much to be desired.  We ordered two pizzas.  One was a thin crust \""Deluxe Combo\"" (pictured) which was passable, but nothing to write home about.  The other was a \""Pesto Bianca\"" with chicken added (pictured) which I almost sent back --- and I never send food back.  The crust was burnt to a non-edible char; my teeth literally could not bite into it.  The chicken (which I paid extra to have!!!) was dry beyond belief.  It had a texture that made me think it was day-old chicken tossed onto a grill to merely reheat was had previously been overdone.  I was surprised that someone in the back-of-house allowed this pizza to leave the kitchen."
1,"For sure, I had to go here for lunch since more people have gone for dinner. The lines are still long!  I asked the server what she thought was the main difference = no sushi.  They had CA rolls but no fish on top of rice.  But I made do with poke (totally hit the spot), oxtail soup (ok), fried clams, sweet potatoes (exceptionally good), prime rib (deliteful), rotisserie chicken (piping hot as he just brought it out), thai curry with mussels (so so).  I sampled the hummus, baba ganoush, guac, salsa to find it was all very good.  I'm not going to name all the gourmet desserts I tried since they were all A1 & I will need to leave more room.  But with 3 people eating lunch, I could have a bite of many & with no repercussions!!!!  All exclaimed this was a worthy lunch buffet (esp since it's a hike from the LV 'burbs)."
1,"We had the Carbonara, the Shiroi Tonkotsu, and the Kuroi Tonkotsu. \n\nThe Carbonara was rich and creamy, perfectly seasoned, with an interesting wide noodle, just really beautifully done.\n\nThe Shiroi was the table favorite hands down. Slightly creamy, but not heavy, Noodles cooked to perfection, not overdone. It was a perfect balance of flavors. \n\nThe Kuroi was earthy and meaty. Very enjoyable. I think this may be a wintertime favorite for me. \n\nThe atmosphere was hip, crisp, and clean. And we had great service from all of the ladies there. I'll definitely be going back again. And I can't wait to try the Tate-Yama"
0,"I gave this restaurant two trys, both times, it was a disaster! After waiting, we were informed our pizza was mistakenly given to someone else. They replaced it with a small pizza. Although we were given a free ice cream cookie, we would have preferred our dinner. The second visit began with them not taking reservations for a group of 18. We were advised to have someone in our party come an hour early and wait for the tables. We did... They gave our tables away! Not much communication between hostess and Waiter. The food was fine. AWhen we received our credit card bill, they had double charged us! Bottom line. Although Cave Creek was excited to welcome Oregano's to our town, it has been a Huge disappointment and not worth the wait, frustration or money. Go somewhere else!"
1,"Been here twice for dinner and its been good!\n\nFood decent, able to cater for gluten free which also includes providing bread which is always a nice touch.\n\nBoth times I've been here I've had terrines as starter and a couple of weeks ago, my fish main course was perfectly cooked salmon which I devoured.\n\nIts worth checking online for deals. We came previously for a friends birthday- three courses and 3 matched gins for \u00a323. Incredibly good value! \n\nIt is a hotel restaurant so if you are looking for atmosphere then you may have to bring you own but you will be guaranteed a lovely meal with great service!"
1,"I would have to say, Both Gordon Ramsey and Robert Irving would like the menu here, its pretty short menu, and your not waking your brain trying to figure out what to get. \nI had a Omelette and OJ, the one thing I REALLY REALLY loved here was the Strawberry Jam! Best jam I EVER had! The Omelette itself, I dont know about the gravy on it, but it was good, wife went with a Omelette that had Goat Cheese on it, the Goat Cheese most diffidently had a bite to it, so not sure I would get it myself, but overall, if your looking for a good Breakfast place in the Tempe area- THIS IS A MUST GO TO place!"
1,"The first time I came here I ordered the bizness salad with brussel sprouts, roasted chicken and curried quinoa. I liked every element except for the brussel sprouts. They were both bitter and too hard to eat. The curried quinoa while dry had a good flavor. No complaints with the roasted chicken, it was how chicken should be. I was also surprised at how generous the portions were. \n\nNow after living in LV for 4 months Bronze Cafe is the restaurant I visit most frequently because of the fresh/high quality ingredients. \n\nLast time I visited, I tried one of their homemade desserts. I chose the peanut butter snickerdoodle cookie, it was hard as a rock and had more of a consistency to that of a shortbread cookie. I could barely make out any cinnamon sugar and the peanut butter was also an after thought."
0,"They illegaly isolated us from the main dining room because of my service dog. They put us in a large empty banquet room that had the AC and music blasting at uncomfortable levels, both of which are triggers to my medical condition. \n\nWhen we asked why we were isolated from the other customers we were told it was an order from the boss. When I informed them that this was illegal as per ADA and state law they eventually moved us to the main dining room with the other customers, but were not apologetic about it. \n\nThe prices were pretty high too. I would not go back here."
1,"Awesome place, bring a group of people and have fun. Awesome food / great beer!"
0,Service is not so great. Took long to make my order no waitress in sight for 15 mjn. Eggplant crisps are good. Margarita pizza came without basil tho :( Once fixed was good. My Italian soda never received.
0,"It's passable. Just don't try calling the front desk. Service here is good when you can find the people or they're not on the phone. On the cell phone, with their friend, that is. -1.\n\nThe rooms were pretty small, but they got the job done. They were in the middle of remodeling, and I think we still had an unremodeled room. I say this because the beds were noticeably softer in another room that we had than the one I stayed in. -1\n\nThere was a sick stain on one of the box springs, it looked like blood. -1.\n\nPlenty of parking, close enough to campus, easy access from I-74."
0,"Great friendly service,  but it didn't make up for the tasteless food.  I got the hummus appetizer plate and a Margherita pizza. \nThe hummus had no taste even though it had  pickles,  red onion and I think a slivers of red bell pepper.  The pita bread seemed very dried out..  I'm not sure if it was left out for a while,  but you'd get a better tasting pita bread from Costco. \nThe pizza was utterly disappointing...  Yeah,  it's fired up in a brick oven yet the dough tasted bland.  They don't use fresh mozzarella cheese which ruined it.  They do sprinkle fresh basil and sliced tomatoes on top.  This has to be the worst Margherita pizza I've ever had. I only had one slice,  since that's all I could tolerate. \nI gave the place two stars since the service was friendly and the place had a good vibe to it,  but I'm not going back. ..   :("
0,"We have stayed at the Wynn many times; thought we would try Caesars as our friends were from France and they ( and us) liked the casino and thought we would donate our $$$ there....Reserved three rooms from Nov 19-21 in the Octavius tower. Supposed to be their higher end rooms. Rooms were tired even though we were told they were recently remodeled. \nHave to say the service overall was marginal; service from Faoud at the front desk was horrible. Gave my wife a real attitude when she was asking about a discrepancy on the bill. We ended up moving to another front desk clerk, Alyssa who helped out. She was great......\nWe also had very poor service at the bar near the Forum shop entrance... the six of us waited for 10 minutes to order. The bartender did not make eye contact...more worried about cleaning the bar and a few glasses than helping us. We ended up walking away. Not real busy either. Then at 24 hr restaurant near the front desk,the waiter was a deer in the headlights. Slow service and multiple requests for silverware, coffee etc.Again not a very busy restaurant .\nBottom line don't expect great or even good service. We will go back to the Wynn or the Cosmo...seems like there is an issue with hotel management."
0,"Edible. Nothing special.  Had some fried Rice and Steak on New Year's Day.  Service lagged, even for hungover visitors."
0,"Nothing special. I've had better chicken, fried okra was not crispy, corn bread ok I guess, Waffle House waffles are better. But the fried chicken gizzards were excellent."
0,"Was at Surrender for MDW to see Calvin Harris, bought prepaid tickets which got us in fast, despite arriving at the scene at 11:30pm. After entering the club hassle-free, the excitement quickly dwindled. \nThe concept of having 80% of the club outdoor is nice, however the implementation was poor. Calvin Harris was playing at the indoor portion of the club, except no one was allowed on the dance floor except if you purchased a $3000 table. Why even let people in if you don't allow anyone on the dance floor? Waste of money on cover, and it wasn't like the cover was cheap either; $100 for guys and $40 for ladies. Go somewhere else to have a  good time."
1,"It's very rare to find Southern Comfort food that delivers I am so happy I found this place ! \n\nPretty much I ordered the 6 jumbo fried shrimp meal which came with 2 sides ( Mac and cheese And mashed potatoes and gravy ) And my mother got a cheese burger meal which came with 1 side also she got Coleslaw as her side .... The Shrimp were absolutely delicious and true to the name Jumbo lol I loved them the Mac and Cheese was to die for !!! ( I think we all have our different preferences on our fav Mac And Cheese lol ) this was great I loved the whole meal ... My mother LOVED the cheeseburger meal the hun was soft , buttery and flakey and she even woke up in the middle of the night to finish it lol ... \n\nI hope you all enjoy this place as much as we do ... We actually just got some more food delivered from them about 15 minutes ago lol but I had to take the time to share this deliciousness with you all gotta go now time to Dig in :)"
0,"Good thing this place has a lot of good reviews or I would never go back.  Since I worked in the Biz  and I am a forgiving person when I think a place may have had an off night. I promise to try it again and repost another review.(  But don't let me down when I go back! Ok Parlor? ) \n\nThe food was not good at all. In fact it should never have left the kitchen. Long story but the chef  was very negligent with our meal and should have never served the food he or she did. My very upset friend won't return. I had the pizza which was bland and flavorless. The crust was good but I am at a loss why people think this is the best pizza in town. It wasn't bad per say, just not great.I am coming to the realization that no pizza here will ever live up to a true NY pizza slice. I am just picky in that regards and am finding I am not a lover of the real Italian/woodfire/whatever way of making pizza nowadays, despite the authenticity. I just long for a slice of Pizza that reminds me of my roots. \n\nThe only thing that saved the day here is the service, which was outstanding!  They did everything right. Even the waiter seemed displeased with the chef's error. The manager and server were  great and i notice those things. The restaurant is also very pretty and we had no wait time when we went. ( So go before 6ish on a Saturday. It got packed shortly after) \n\nOn a key note the french pressed coffee and Tiramusu are great here! They have these Hazelnut chip pieces on top that were scrumptious!  This might be a new, great dessert place for me, if the food doesn't please me on the next visit. \n\nOk Parlor, until  next time!"
0,"This was my first and only visit to the Brooklyn bowl. I loved the ambiance of the business but the bowling is what ruined my night. When there's a live concert there's a $100 minimum fee for the bowling which is so dumb. Then we waited until the concert was over so we only had to pay $25/per half hour (still not worth it) and they add food and drinks onto the one bill and charge for everything. Socks. Food. And unless you're playing they won't let you in so they wouldn't let our friends in. Most expensive bowling game I've ever had. $390 without tip. Also the service at the Lanes was slow. My friend asked the server what beers were on draft and he replied, \""it's on the menu.\"" Simply, they weren't friendly and over charged for everything! Never again Brooklyn bowl."
1,"Nice middle-eastern place near CMU.\nI usually get the 'Vegetarian Special' which is box with rice, hummus and baba ganoush (and bread). They also have awesome 'Sleek' which is this awesome concoction of kale, onions and beans.. tried it for the first time today and loved it.\nThe owner seems to really care about his food... always reminds me to hold box the right way when I get take-out.. seems like he really knows his middle-eastern food.\nAwesome place, but a bit on the pricier end, I could get a more diverse platter of food for cheaper at the middle-eastern truck at margaret morrison st."
1,Best pole dancing teacher around! Hannah has a way of making you feel comfortable and ultimately confident in yourself.  The way she approaches teaching is non intimidating. She is a super sweet girl with a contagious personality. I always leave her studio on cloud 9!
0,"After reading all of the positive reviews, we were stoked.  All I can say after eating there is that people here in AZ have no ability to discern good food from food that is merely different. \nThe dining experience did not start out well.  The table had been wiped off after the previous diners, but it was still greasy.  We ordered wine and the wine glasses had some film on them, maybe from being rinsed in water that was not clean?\nWe ordered the calamari and Greek Fries as appetizers.  The calamari were VERY dry.  I had the feeling they were cooked earlier and kept warm.  The fries were pretty unique but the lemon sauce they were served on was waaaay too tart.\nThe biggest problem with the meal was when our entrees were brought to the table only 2 - 3 minutes after we got the appetizers.  My husband's comment to the wait person was met with little more than a shrug, although later on she did say that the kitchen had the food ready too quickly.\nThe entrees (gyros sandwich, chicken souvlaki, Greek salad with grilled chicken) were just OK.  All of us felt that the food was not hot, further supporting the thought that everything was prepared in advance and reheated.  The seasoning were nicely done, however.\nIt's a safe bet we'll be looking elsewhere the next time we have a taste for Greek food."
1,"Tofu,tofu and more tofu...ALL you can eat! This is not your standard go to the buffet and fill your plate, this is a sit -down and get served. The General Tao, sweet and sour chicken, is great as is the crispy tofu, 2 kinds of sushi, Thai salad,stir fried veggies, and battered eggplant. The green salad is somewhat odd tasting, the shrimp,duck, too salty, and the sweet and sour beef looked like fried spam and didn't taste much better. The hot and sour soup looked like some sort of weird jell-o, but tasted ok, not great.  Skip dessert, as the green tea ice cream is made with Carnation milk and is soooo ewwwwww!! Don't know if the vanilla is any better, ask for fresh fruit instead, and hope they have it.This place is good for groups,but service is slow. Decor is very zen,but the bathrooms need plumbing work and more attention to supplies. There is a surcharge for \""wasted\""food, so be careful not to over order."
0,"Canceled my service in Feb 2, 2011\nThey kept charging me and took money out of my bank account. Called them to fix it and they couldn't. Something was wrong with their system. My account is frozen with an error and no one can overwrite it or fix it.\nThey kept charging me until JULY, that's 6 months.\nCall almost every month and wasted 45-60 mins with them on the phone trying to get my refund. Been transferred so many times I think I spoke with the whole damn company.\nFinally after almost a full year in Jan 2012 got my refund. With no apology and no interest for having my money for 11 months. Some F up shit. HATE this company. STAY FAR FAR AWAY~!"
1,"The other worldly pleasure that is a meal at Bella Italia!\n\nI've eaten here quite a few times, and for an extremely busy restaurant, which also happens to be a chain, I'm repeatedly surprised by the quality of the food!\n\nBella Italia has two branches in Edinburgh, one at Northbridge, and my personal favourite at Hanover. Technically, there's no noticeable difference between the two branches; I'd even say the one at Northbridge looks nicer,  and has some pleasant outdoor seating for those few and cherished days when the sun shines in Edinburgh (jokes jokes...)\n\nFor some reason, I've repeatedly trekked all the way to Princes street, turned on to Hanover, and treated myself to the greatest pizzas and desserts! I've eaten here because I was bored, for a break from shopping, and then for my 19th birthday dinner! Service is great, and on one occasion, my pizza was diligently replaced (after I'd devoured half of it) when the waitress realized an ingredient was missing from my order. More pizza for me, so I wasn't complaining!\n\nI would definitely recommend Bella for just about every dining occasion; dinner with friends, a large group, a date.. and they're also very affordable. The banoffee pie should not go untasted! \n\nAs I've written this, I'm quite tempted to head back real soon; I even managed to score a free umbrella from a member of staff last December, so I definitely feel appreciated as well!"
1,Pink.  I love this hotel amazing location best on the strip.  Pool that is warm not to mention eye candy tropical paradise.  Love the Harrah bonus being able to use any of the Harrah's pools.  4th time in Vegas in the last 5 1/2 years.  Cant wait til the high roller is done.  Las Vegas has a city wide tax on all hotels and resorts you pay it at everyone.  Flamingo gives you a credit also mgm casino's also charge it and also give you a credit too.
1,After trying curry corner I went on an indian binge. The Dhaba is just as delicious but the service lacked...a smile from the waiter would have made this review 5 stars.
0,"The food was a solid 4 maybe 4.5 stars but our service was... well we really didn't have any. Delightful greeting and he did take our order in good time. But then we were abandoned. We begged for a tea refill by flagging down another server. We could not get the check and our server never returned after our brunch was served. To add insult we noticed hot beignets being sent to tables at the end of service. We inquired of the maitre de on the way out and he seemed surprised we were not offered any. To his credit he offered to pack up some to go, but we were over it by this time. \n   A pretty place and the food was very nicely done, but at $50 a pop per person for brunch you ought to be able to get a refill on the ice tea."
0,I have ordered pizza from here a couple of times to be delivered. The last pizza I got I ordered the thin and crispy crust. The only thing they got right was the thin. You could not even hold a piece of pizza in your hand because it was so floppy. I will not be ordering from there again. I should have picked up a pizza from Papa Murphy's and baked it myself. It would've tasted better and been a lot cheaper!
1,"Wow! The perfect combination of creamy, sweet and flavorful ice creams with a beautiful melt. Not a lot of frilly flavors, just the basics, but done so very well. Vanilla bean and double chocolate in a cup: total yum! Best ice cream in Phoenix, no doubt."
1,"Convenient and delicious. Slightly higher price than other 'drive-thrus' but the portion size is relative. Even at the drive through I wait a little while, but honestly- it's worth it - which says alot!\n\nI will definitely keep going back."
1,"It's a really groovy space. I had an excellent burger. Our server Gerardo was terrific. We spoke with the manager Suda who was also lovely. If you're looking for a super groovy new school Mexican restaurant downtown, definitely check out La Comida."
0,"Wish I could leave 0 stars. \n\nWe came here two years ago. Dinner was OK. Cute place. \n\nDecided to stop for dinner. VERY few people there (not a good sign).  Again, not busy. Waited 10 mins. Waitress came near us 3 times. Never greeted us. Never welcomed us. 10 minutes. Again not busy.  \n\nWe got up and left. Service is terrible. Very disappointed."
0,"The burgers, fries and shakes we were anticipating were just mediocre.  Service so sketchy that the manager finally took our order.  Much better available elsewhere with more choices, better service, location and happier employees@"
0,"So, always been a fan of this place until I started eating there regularly since I work in the area. So now I can poke holes through this place...kind of like when you stay at a friend's house a while, you start finding out things that you didn't suspect. \nSome dishes I will never grow tired of: the caramelized onion tart, kale salad, curry, and the big bowl of raw veggies with the two dips. All outstanding.\nOther dishes vary from just ok to not at all my flavor profile. I won't hold it against them. But there are a couple of rip offs...\nALL DRINKS. All rip offs. Medicine man whatever...watered down. So expensive, flushed with soda water, full of ice. There is literally two sips in the glass.  Totally not worth it at $6 each. At least. Say yes to a refill? Get charged an other $6. \nSalads are teeny tiny. I still pay $8 for the tangy kale salad since I'm a bit addicted, but the chicken chopped at $14 is a total joke. I ordered it to go just a few days ago and it looked like a $3 salad. Not even an once of chicken, a few tiny pieces of manchego and ONE date. ONE!!! The container was about 6 inches long and had about an inch tall of salad. Not even appetizer size. With tax, it was over $16. That makes me angry. And that makes me give only two stars."
1,"We went to Lon's to celebrate our 49th wedding anniversary.  We are usually out of the country for this occasion so we weren't sure if this would measure up.  I can tell you that Lon's treated us like celebrities.  Even the manager Sean Donnelly went out of his way to welcome us and made sure we had a nice private table.  When he heard us talking about our anniversary he took it upon himself to serve us a beautiful dessert with a candle, compliments of the house.  The food was spectacular and the service top notch.  We are now \""hooked on Lon's.\"""
0,Took close to 20 minutes for an incredibly bland burger and mediocre fries. They couldn't even give me a full cup of ketchup. Absolutely not worth the money. How could anyone eat here on their lunch break? Save your time and money and hit Cookout.
1,"Excellent, from start to finish. Dined at SW on Friday 4/5/13 with 5 friends. We did have a reservation and didn't have to wait at all for our table which I like. We even made a last minute change and got a table outside with a great view. The entire staff was great, very friendly, welcoming, and knowledgeable. They have some great selections in the bread basket so be sure to check those out. Had a shrimp cocktail appetizer which I enjoyed. A friend and I shared the Porterhouse for two instead of each ordering a bone-in rib eye. A good call. I had great mac & cheese at Chef Neil Perry's Rockpool in Melbourne so I decided to give SW's a try. Not as good as Neil's but still a nice side dish and worth the money as it can be shared with multiple people. They have a Vegan page on the menu which is pretty cool for a steakhouse. For dessert I went with the daily special which was Chocolate Souffl\u00e9: AWESOME. I snapped a few pics for your enjoyment... Definitely go to SW for dinner."
1,Not the coolest of places... but my goodness! are the pints of 80/ here so good!\n\nAlso the Beatles memorabilia are pretty impressive.  Friendly too.\n\nSave me having to trek down to Diggers for a damn good pint.
1,"I am surprised I liked this place as much as I did. I ordered  vegetable dumplings. the guy next to me suggested I use the large spoon, add a splash of vinegar and a splash of soy sauce and top it with some ginger. I did that and wow I am glad I listened. I don't know much about dumplings really so that is how I end my review.\ni will go back and try something else real soon."
1,"Originally we were going to eat at Naked Fish but they had a little wait so we decided to drive down the street and try out Sen of Japan... \nSOJ has a nice ambience.. definitely a step up from a typical neighborhood sushi joint.. Dim-lighting, soft music and wooden floors.. It was a little warm at first at our table but it eventually cooled down.. \n\nWe ordered :\nSashimi Salad: Fresh cuts of fish & I liked the capers in the salad\nSoft Shell Crab Roll topped with Spicy Tuna: The spicy tuna really stood out in taste and appearance.. you could just tell it was very good quality..\nFoie Gras Udon: I don't think it was worth $18 haha came with 2 tiny little pieces of foie gras.. I will say that the broth had a nice deep flavor and it came with lots of yummy greens.. \n\nFor those 3 items without tip it was about $50 so it's not cheap by any means but if you are looking for a nice sushi place that's a step up from your neighborhood joint but don't want to go all the way to the strip then Sen of Japan is perfect for you~\n\n\nHOT TIP: Late night HH (Mon-Sat; 10:30PM-1:30AM)"
1,"We went for brunch today and it was AWESOME. The place was quiet and calm and the waitstaff was friendly and efficient. Their vegan brunch was better than any other vegan brunch I've had, and we have some excellent restaurants in LA. \n\nThis will become a regular place to dine when I visit Phoenix."
1,"This lounge is a great place to have a cigar and watch some live music.\n I stopped in for after dinner last night and the Peter Monroy band was cranking tunes by Journey, Judas Priest, Billy Idol, Guns and Roses and much more great music.\n\nI missed Peter's female singers and dancers and he's made many changes with the band members - but the new members sounded great!\n\nLa Scena has no cover charge bu they make it up on the drinks - a Amsteel Light will set you back $7.00 but it's a great place to people watch.\n\nThis is great place to hang out with friends or come in for a night cap!"
1,"I love Goldies! Its like the \""Cheers\"" of Scottsdale, but everybody doesn't know my name there yet.  Gotta try the Goldaritas. Great place for happy hour, and to watch a game. Can get crowded, hard to find a seat at the bar. \n\nTip- pretty decent buffalo wings"
1,"Dear La Condesisima or whoever you are now...I don't need to add to the already glowing reviews of your food, I love it and hope you stay around forever (especially your chile oil...I could drink that stuff).\n\nIn fact, I love it so much that I frequently crave it on my way home from work....but I am almost always thwarted by the fact that no one ever answers the phone to take my order. I'm not going to stop and wait for you to take and make my order when I'm trying to bring dinner home to my kids, I just want to order over the phone so I can walk in and pick it up. \n\nPlease answer your phone so I can spend my money at your place.\n\n(unless you're trying to discourage take-out orders, in which case please tell me so I can stop getting my hopes up when the craving strikes!) \n\nThanks!"
1,Great customer service with the new owners! Make you feel at home and the prices are great. Very clean too. I used to go across the street and after they were always too busy I decided to try this place and I'm glad I did! Great service and great customer service!
1,"I'm just down the street from Downside, so it's more of a go-to than something I plan on doing.  The bartenders are always on-top of the game, normally remembering everyone that comes through the door.  Gotta say that the happy hour prices aren't the \""happiest\"", however the food is still pretty decent and always comes out pretty quick.  \n\nLike I said, it's more of a last-minute place for me being that I'm less than two miles from there on Via de Ventura however Downside is still a staple in the area where a lot of locals go for a friendly drink or two and a good meal."
1,"Fast quick service! My first time here took down my name address and asked if I wanted to use conventional oil or something else. Waiting room was please and clean, weren't too pushy with the filters and other stuff they try to sell you. They also vacuum out your interior and wash your window which is always a plus , overall good service I will continue to come here if I'm in the area."
0,"Came in for dinner on a Saturday night at about 9 PM.  A little busy, but the service was fairly quick.  Large selection - mostly bar food.\n\nGirlfriend had a taco salad which had a very greasy shell. I had a club sandwich with fries and a cup of chili.  Fries were made there, crispy and great. Club was not toasted and had no spread. Chili was tasty.\n\nPrices were a bit higher than a Phoenix bar & grill, but I guess it is Cave Creek."
1,"House Seats is one of the most amazing things to happen to me! Last year alone I went to more than 200 shows off of the account. This number includes some of the strip's biggest shows, as well as smaller (but great) shows. It is well worth the investment- you will get your money back within one or two shows. \n\nSign up with this link until 11/9/14 and you can get 2 years for the price of 1! \nhttp://lv.houseseats.com/join/?referer=lisa_crockett@comcast.net"
1,"This was one of my fave places to visit while I was in Vegas: drinks are cheap, souvenirs are cheap, food is cheap....need I say more?\n\nBetween the casinos lining the sides and the drink vendors beckoning, what is there not to like about Freemont? The price tag is way less than the strip so you can do way more with the money you have! The souvenir shops were way cheaper as well (we bought an ash tray for my grandfather on the strip for $8 and found the same there for 99 cents!)\n\nThey also have a canopy show which is pretty awesome as well as ziplining (which was closed while I was there, so disappointing)"
0,"Underwhelmed, I would say the ownership\nand lack of quality employees makes the place mediocre at best. The bread is so heavy, it made me nauseous for a day, and god forbid you ask for any of the freebies you get frowned upon as if you're asking for their bank account information. Not to mention the globs of Mayo they add to these sandwiches and the soggy shredded lettuce and store bought tasting guacamole they put on the Beach Club. Pretty cheap for an expensive sandwich. DISGUST. The owners I believe, a tall guy with green eyes is always touching his nose and his obscenely tan shorter comrade are both very snooty and stuck up. The tan one less so, he seemed a little friendlier. And then the African American kid with braces that claims to be the manager that hates his job? I could literally die. Anywho, after giving that place the benefit of the doubt thinking maybe these were all isolated incidents (which they're not) I have decided to take my business elsewhere."
1,Excellent customer service!!! Quick turnaround! Clothes returned neat and clean. I will definitely be a repeat customer!
1,"Ok, my new favorite flavor....the lychee tart!  That's all I get now is the lychee with the mochi! Yum in my tummy! They were giving away 5 oz. free at the LVAC on Flamingo too. Definitely made my day! I will be back again Yogurtland!"
1,"Hello Zink, sorry for forgetting about you for so long, that's embarrassing considering I live nearby! My first thought walking in here was, what wonderful ambiance and decor! The lighting is warm and inviting and the modern look translates well to the creative twists on traditional american cuisine offered here.\n\nThe service here is excellent, friendly and charming without being too intrusive. Water refills were right on the dot, every time my water glass was close to being empty it was refilled posthaste. That was quite a feat considering they weren't very large glasses and I go through water pretty fast. The soft pretzels that come out while you're waiting are delicious and the mustard dipping sauce was pretty good as well. I ordered the herb encrusted trout with a bean and rock shrimp succotash. It was sooo good! The presentation was whimsical with succotash served in a miniature iron skillet, I couldn't really detect too much flavor in my herb encrusted trout but the basil oil reduction that came with it proved very flavorful and aromatic. The succotash was probably one of my favorite parts of the meal. It was flavorful and well seasoned, perfectly cooked, and the rock shrimp incorporated into it were succulent and added a nice dimension to the textures present in the succotash. Excellent!\n\nThis place definitely was much better than I expected. Now keep in mind that it won't be an eat here every night type place due to the prices, but on the next occasion I'm feeling like a nice night out I'll keep you in my mind Zink."
0,"Horrible! Our waiter switched when we sat down, and a new one came up and said \""I got you guys b/c I get all the pretty ladies\"" barf. We ordered before our drinks even came, service was not good. Food was ok, but not worth the ridiculous prices even at brunch."
0,"I visited here a few weeks back while I was in town as I've heard the food is amazing but I am sad to say that we were really let down. Not by the food but by the service alone. \n\nTwo friends and I visited on a week night (I believe it was a Tuesday) and we were seated quickly on the outside patio and brought menus. Very simple menu which is a plus. Between the three of us we ordered a pizza and some pasta and a few drinks. We found it to be a little pricey and over rated but all in all we happy with the food. \n\nThe place was not very crowded this night either - the patio tables seemed to be occupied and the inside had a handful of table occupied as well. Not too slow, not too busy. \n\nService seemed to be good until we neared the end of our meal. Our plates were cleared away once we had finished the food (as expected) and our check was dropped off at the table. We were still drinking our drinks while enjoying conversation, paid our bill, then just a few short moments later our glasses and drinks were all removed from the table without our request. The server straight up cleared our entire table without saying a single word to us. It was a moment where we were not only confused as to why she was doing this but also very irritated. It not only made us feel very uncomfortable but unwelcome. We immediately regretted the huge tip that we left. \n\nWe would have understood if the place was at capacity, there was a wait to be seated and they needed the table but that was not the case at all.\n\nWe clearly got the vibe she was sending (and it wasn't a good one), picked up our stuff and left. My husband (someone who has been working in restaurant management for the last 15+ years) was very uneasy about what had just happened and as we were walking out to leave he turned back around and asked to speak with a manager. He explained the situation to the \""manager\"" there but it was evident he didn't seem to really care as he didn't try one bit to remedy the situation or change our minds on their establishment. Worst choice he could have made right there.\n\nI've never ever encountered such rude service in my life and this is coming from someone who eats out at restaurants quite frequently. \n\nNeedless to say we were all very very disappointed. I'd never visit this place again or recommend it due to their lack of respect and service alone."
1,"The food and service were top notch.  We were held captive at the MGM for a conference, and lunch here (twice) was a welcome break.  Both times, I was treating clients, and both times, the waitstaff was excellent, and the food was as wonderful as you'd expect from Emeril's.  I am NOT a fish eater, and I loved my burger!   Good call."
1,"While this is no Pebble Beach, this course is beautiful and the pricing is very competitive!  When I am not golfing, I walk this course almost nightly with my dog because it is a beautiful oasis in the Las Vegas desert (the exercise is nice too!).  The course tours the player through the entire Rhodes Ranch residential development with recurrent water features beginning on the 3rd hole.  \n\nThe greens are challenging with hazards and roughs found on every hole, but also with wide open fairways to keep the newer player's morale up.  The pro staff are incredibly friendly and almost every golf package includes 2 free draft beers- you can never go wrong with that!\n\nThe course was looking unusually ragged this summer, but it reopens from over seeding tomorrow and is a crisp, rich green again.  If you are a golfer, the membership cannot be beat.  Around $30/month with free range use and cart fee only greens fees in the mornings and afternoons!\n\nThis is a great course and I doubt anyone who plays it will be disappointed!"
0,This place is the worst Vietnamese restaurant that I have ever experienced. The soups/pho was so bland and all the other dishes that I had were horrible. With all the other businesses going belly up I am surprised this one has not bitten the dust yet.
0,"Uptight and unwelcoming....they take themselves way too seriously. We should have taken a hint when we saw that the place was DEAD on a Saturday night. The food is boring and run of the mill, for the price of a top notch dish. The service was appalling.\n\nWhen you walk in, you are greeted by a self righteous middle aged server who will be appalled that you don't order wine, he will be equally appalled that you don't eat meat. You will open the menu and see rabbit leg dishes and duck dishes for hilarious prices. We wanted to get up and leave after reading the menu but we were so hungry that we just decided to eat quickly and leave. \n\nThe only vegetarian dish was the gnocci with tomato sauce - which is what I was forced to order because there was no other option. My partner got the same thing.\n\nWhen our food arrived we were almost ready to pass out from hunger, and when you're hungry everything tastes good right? Wrong. The dish tasted like someone opened a can of tomato paste, added some milk, and called it a day.\n\nOur bill came to $65 for 2 gnocci dishes (no drinks, nothing). It would have been worth the price if the food was good. It was far from. \n\nI would like to give this place a half star."
1,"It's packing but you can still get in quickly which is a good thing if there are 6 of you and you are hungry.  Pretty standard fare but it is reasonably priced and they get it to the table pretty darn quick.\n\nWill say they do make some significantly large enough pancakes.  I suggest the blueberry ones - YUM!  And they will keep the juices, water, and coffee coming as long as you want them.  Even though we like trying new places to eat when we travel we seem to gravitate to this place each time we are in Scottsdale."
0,"Do not take your bridesmaids dresses there , read good reviews but realized clearly it wasn't due to their great job on dresses. My dress was butchered and after paying $60 , and not offered any type of reimbursement for the 5 times I had to go back, I am upset.  It was a big mess of a job that was done to my dress and was told by the lady it doesn't look bad this far away as she is 5 ft away from me. Save yourself money and stress and take it somewhere else."
0,"I fell asleep during O. \n\nI know, I know. It's supposed to be one of the best shows in Vegas, but I just couldn't get into it. I thought they relied too much on stage design, and very little on story and the \""wow\"" factor. Overall, I thought the water element was too gimmicky, and in the end, worked against the show.\n\nI saw Ka last winter and thought it was absolutely mind-blowing, so I was expecting O to be along the same lines in terms of production. I was really disappointed with O. \n\nAnyway, like some others have said, there really are few bad seats in the house. I could see the front rows and the seats along the sides of the theater having obstructed views. We were seating on the first balcony (LOGGIA, right), in the first and only row, so our view was pretty spot on.\n\nSo, if you're planning on seeing O, I would recommend checking your expectations at the door. Hopefully, you won't fall asleep too! :)"
0,"We went back to Outback last night thanks to a $10 \""gift\"" card and had hoped things had changed for the better but had not. I could drop my rating back half a star but my wife actually enjoyed her meal.\n\nThe reasoning behind dropping at least 1/2 a star is that Outback has deemed it necessary to skimp on their portions in order to make the plates more artsy-fartsy or more \""presentable\"", for those of you who drink with your pinky in the air.\n\nBlooming onion was a bit overcooked and the coating was falling off the onions. (Onions were STRONG, Altoids\u00ae are a must this morning!). Caesar salad's dressing was very strong, too. Mixed drinks were on the small side. I could've sworn the glasses were bigger before.\n\nChicken and ribs: I got a very tiny grilled chicken breast that was a bit on the dry side. The side of ribs were 1/3 the size of their normal full slab and they were the best part of the meal. Side of mashed potatoes were too garlicky and portions tiny.\nMy better-half had the sweet potato fries that were just \""okay\"".\n\nOur server, Noah, was great. Fast, efficient, and friendly. I could almost bump up my rating to another star because of him.\n\nYour pal,\nWalter"
0,"Beware of their service and lack of experienced mechanics on the weekends. A bad diagnosis of my vehicle proved to be very costly and could have compromised my family's safety. \n\nBrought in my vehicle for power steering evaluation. Came out instead with a new rack and pinion job.  Jeff, the weekend manager suggested that it was required. Interestingly enough, a job that runs over $1600. Needless to say, they botched the job and ended up causing a leak in our power steering. Jeff saw the leak and explained to us that it was from a little spillage when they were filling up the power steering fluid. Total BS. This dude sent us off on the road for our drive back home to LA and to no surprise,  the leak got worse and the steering tightened up. \n\nFortunately, we made it home and the very next day found a local Big O Tires to reevaluate and fix the leak.    They contacted Steve, form Big O Tires in Henderson and he agreed to cover the job fix. That's the one positive I was able to take away from this. Steve, the store manager took the time to hear out my concerns and seems to be looking to turn things around. Only time will tell."
0,"I think a more appropriate name for this restaurant should be \""The Disappointing Egg\"", as I was very disappointed in my meal. I got a veggie omelet that was supposed to include broccoli among other vegetables. The \""broccoli\"" in my omelet was literally a pinch of broccoli scraps that you might find at the bottom of the bag. It was mostly onion, which is a pretty big cop-op for an overpriced omelet. Granted, this was my first time here, so bear that in mind w/me review, this experience has lead me to not want to come back. I found it to be a waste of time, money, and calories."
0,the property is undergoing construction.   You may want to select another location until they are done.   then you should let a few months pass and check the reviews again.
0,"Nice atmosphere, and nice decor... But, worth the price? I don't think so. \nThey charged 4 dollars (50 cents per person) for water... WTF? My buddies ordered water, and they charged that for tab water? Bogus if you ask me. \n\nAnother thing, we asked if we can be seated outside, but the lady at the front desk ignored us and said sorry, you table is here. She didn't even bother to answer the question or tell us that theirs no available space. I didn't like the attitude at all. \n\nFood? Decent! $20+ for Kobe Beef Taco? First of all, fake Kobe Beef... Tasted exactly like American beef. The same thing can be found at Taco Bell for $0.99 cents when they are on promotion. Why spend $20+?\n\nI wouldn't come here..."
1,"Reddddddd Robin.....Yum.\n\nWhiskey River BBQ burger is really all I get here so i cant speak to any other thing.  Its just hard to stray away from that good of a burger.\n\nWhen I was here most recently, I ordered the sweet potato fries instead of the normal fries....they were great...however they dont have a sauce for them and there is also no brown suger or anything on them to take them to the next level...so you end up with good fries that get bland after about 5. :(  comeon Red Robin, develop a sauce to go with those fries.\n\nAs always, the staff was very friendly and attentetive.  I always seem to get good service here."
1,"Pei Wei is consistently fresh, tasty, and a good value.\n\nThis location is no different, and during the rainy storm of the century last week, it did the trick for a great lunch.\n\nI don 't know a ton about this area, so I can't help much, other than saying it's in a strip mall, surrounded by other retail stores. If you've been in one Pei Wei, you've essentially been in them all. The one strange thing with this location, is that near the drink section, there are a row of bar style seats. They are nice looking, but when people are sitting in them, they pretty much block the pathway from the beverage section to the main seating area. Weird.\n\nAnyway, if you are in need of a tasty, predictable lunch, this is a good spot."
0,1st time here and my gosh so very pricey...I couldn't even use any of the discounts they offered online or in Yelp. These $25 cupcakes better be good & worth it. :-/ Bad service & advertisement.
0,"When I say DISAP you say POINTED. Disappointed!  Disappointed!  I really hate writing this review because in the past we have had such great experiences at EDO and this review is not about the food because the Sushi and Hibachi are good food.  But the service...WHOA!\n\nPicture it...Valentines Day and my wife and almost 2 year old want a nice dinner.   We debated many nice places but with the child they can be difficult at times so we decided some Sushi and Hibachi is nice, quick and delicious.  So we plan a early arrival at a place we have been to before...EDO!  When we arrive the place is almost empty and we get one of the private dining rooms.\n\nSushi Rolls are ordered as an appetizer. Dumplings and chicken fried rice are ordered are ordered for our daughter to come out with the appetizers.  And a Hibachi meal to split for my wife and I as an entree. And....we wait.\n\nAfter 50 minutes still no food.  Ok, starting to get annoyed.  1 hour and 15 minutes of waiting and here come our sush....nope.  it is our Hibachi entree.  WTF?  Really?  I was explained by the waitress that they had an influx of orders and were really behind.  Hmmmm, ok...so I decided to scope out the scene because they obviously had many patrons arrive after we did.  Not so much, because the place had maybe 2 people at the Hibachi table, 2 people at the sushi bar, and about 5 other tables full.  In other words the place was dead.\n\nAbout 10 minutes after our entree arrived our daughters food arrived and the chicken friend rice was bland and the dumplings were still cold. \n\n1.5 hours after our arrive we finally got 2 of our 3 sushi rolls and the third about 10 minutes after that.  We enjoyed the first 2 rolls and got the third to go as we were obviously over the experience and not even our daughter who was starving liked her food (she ate what she probably really wanted after we left, McDonalds).\n\nI have a hard time understanding a couple things here.  1)  How does it take 1.5 hours for sushi when the place is dead.  2) Why would you bring our entree our before our appetizer when we clearly wanted the sushi first?  3) When we placed the kids order and said bring that ASAP....does that mean an hour of so later?  \n\nDo not get me wrong.  Besides the chicken fried rice and the frozen dumplings the hibachi and sushi were great but holy lord the service was about as fun as watching Alabama win a National Football Championship (and for an Auburn fan that is not fun).\n\nSorry EDO, I love your food and maybe you can make it up to me in the future but the service last night was pure crap and a major turn off.  What happened EDO?   What happened?  DISAP...\n\nOh yeah, oh, the steamed rice and little sauces that normally accompany the hibachi never arrived and when we asked the waitress she knew nothing about them."
1,First time! After asking some fellow YELPERS where do i go.. they didnt point me in the wrong direction! \n\nthe place is small. but i like that. makes me feel like its a mom and pop place.. but then again it is. \nThe service was great even though they were busy ( i went at lunch ) \nthey were quick getting the food to the table and it was piping hot! \nthe chips and salsa were really good. \n \nI ordered the Baja Chicken Burro! and it was GOOOOOD!
1,"Found this place on yelp as we arrived in charlotte 4pm with our 5 yr old and 2 yr old.  Figured they'd like hibachi...we were right!\n\nService was great, very kid friendly and helpful.  Food was plentiful.  Our table got a freebie of teriyaki shrimp (maybe they do this for all tables?).\n\nOur party had the chicken and steak selections, all good.   2 adults and 2 kids. We were out the door for $85, including a nice tip.  Small kids will love the chef act!\n\nMake reservations!  We did and we were glad."
1,"Despite being a local, I've been here several times.  I really really enjoy the drinks, and if you go with a group of 4-6 buy a bottle and enjoy it in the butt-ass-cold vodka room.  Awesome.\n\nThe only problem here--if you can call it that--is the bar area gets very crowded.  The ice bar is awesome too, but I've had some challenges getting up to it and ordering my drinks.\n\nThe late-night food is great and not too expensive considering the locale."
0,"Keep on driving by.........\n\nI don't understand the high reviews.   I've been here twice just to check myself.\n\nBoth coffee and espresso have no taste.\n\nTo boot, wireless does not work well.  I had to use a neighboring business.\n\nMove on to the next place......."
1,"Absolutely love this place!! GREAT attentive service, nice quiet ambiance and the best part is their food!!! Its been many years since we have found a our \""go to restaurant\"" !!!! Just about anything we have ordered has been outstanding!\nIt sits tucked away off of the main street but they still get plenty of traffic:) Their music is soft flowing and unobtrusive and easy listening!  Do give it a try!"
0,"When we walked in no one greeted us. Then we stood awkwardly at the bar for five minutes while bartenders waited on the few other customers already seated. I just feel like a head nod & I'll be right with you goes a long way. \n\nThey were out of half of the beers advertised. So we settled on something no one really wanted. No growlers for sale as they were short on beer. \n\nThe interior was clean but extremely utilitarian. The bar stools are round, metal and uncomfortable. My husband said they looked like the stools used in high school shop class. Seating is very limited. \n\nThey had a couple of lonely hotdogs on a Target-like spinning electric grill & a block of cheese sitting on a counter. Food is beside the point here.  \n\nOn the patio, no wait service. Late in the afternoon someone (the owner?) \nblocked part of the patio off with a piece of rope & declared it \""reserved\"" for \""his friends\"". \n\nAt some point, sharing a patio with the older clientele at Luma will become an issue.\n\n\nI don't want to pan this place. I feel it has potential. But the devil is in the details. And they need to pay attention to the details."
0,Horrible just horrible. Aren't they suppose to clean your teeth? I hate going to businesses with lazy workers. The Doctor is lazy. Go elsewhere for better work.
1,"This place is pretty good.  Convenient and great hours.  Although I greatly prefer rice over a sandwich 95% of the time, this place was pretty good.  Nice location at the edge of the PH Casino and shops.  The food came out very fast and fresh.  Great place for a quick bite with reasonable prices."
1,"The food was excellent.  The mac and cheese with lobster, the lobster was plentiful and big chunks.  The New York was juicy and the Sea Bass was divine.  The Ginger Peach drink was refreshing :)  Travis, our server, was very personable.  Definitely recommend and will go back."
0,"What hotel doesn't have wifi?!?!? I called for wifi and they told me I had to go down to the casino for it to be free. I'm trying to check a few work emails before going out, what the heck! Room is okay, asked for a strip view and even paid extra and got a view of the towers -__-  Probably won't stay here again."
0,"My new coworkers invited me to go get \""cheap mexican\"" with them for lunch. Now, from where I work, you could walk to more skeevy, run down looking, hole in the wall mexican joints than you can count on a hand, and I'm pretty sure at least a few of them would be absolutely delicious (as hole in the wall restaurants tend to be). Unfortunately, I can not report on any of them, because we drove by them and went to Zapatas.\n\nI won't say that Zapata's was bad, partially because i don't think it is deserved and partially because it feels like I am giving credit for more effort than they earned. While the salsa that came with our gratis basket of chips was full of cilantro and onion flavor, that was the high point of the meal. We ate off the lunch menu, and I went with the enchilada and taco plate. The meat in both was slightly greasy and not particularly flavorful. The taco shell tasted like it was pulled out of the grocery store box on my pantry shelf. The rice was bland and slightly overcooked. I do have to give them credit for the enchilada sauce being kinda tasty, but nothing I wouldn't expect from a jarred sauce. The low point was definitely the refried beans, which are often my favorite part. I took one mouthful, found them utterly disgusting and left the rest of them on my plate to form a sad, cold congealed mess.\n\nI have often thought that quality service can redeem an otherwise forgettable meal, well in that case creepy, unpleasant service can cement a bad impression. Despite our party of three being one of less than a handful of patrons in his section, our waiter was slow to get to our table even after being called over. He gave off a used car salesman type of aura and loses additional point for trying to talk me into drinking tequila on my lunch break.\n\nThe only reason I can imagine returning to Zapata's would be at my coworkers request, and even then I might think about sticking with the tuna sandwich I brought from home. Oh, and as for that \""cheap\"" bit. The lunch pricing is in the 6-10 dollar range, which isn't particularly remarkable when there are tacos to be found for under 2 bucks."
0,"I am surprised by all the good reviews, I was very disappointed with the Pad Thai, it was overpriced, small, and did not taste good. I can't comment on the rest of the menu, but there is much better thai in sdale and tempe. Pass this place up."
1,"We love this place. \nMy son is only 13 months and I'm sure he'll love it even more when he'll grow up.\nThe water section is awesome, really allows the little ones to learn a lot. \n\nThe whole museum is just great, and their membership rates are WORTH IT, specially if a few friends can purchase it together and if you go pretty often. The only down side is that a single time entry ticket is $12 for any age... Meaning if you're coming with grandpa, grandma, hubby and two kids, that's... EXPENSIVE."
1,"There was a line out the door, and upon watching the other patrons waiting for a table holding their BYO wares,  I dispatched myself to get a bottle of beer for the appetizers and a bottle of wine for the mains.  Fortunately there was a place nearby.\n\nThe food did not disappoint.  It was certainly home made and turned out to be great.  I was short on imagination so we did not stray from the typical order of Dolmas, Artichokes, Calimari for starters and then Lamb for mains.  My friends got the Shisk-Kabob which they swear were the best they have had.\n\nIf you are in Montreal please go, it will not dissapoint."

0,"I'm really not a big fan of Food 4 Less.  I have been to a couple around town and just don't care for the place.  Here's why:\n\n1. Every store seems laid out in a weird fashion, so I end up walking back and forth a dozen times to find all of my items.  \n\n2. You rarely see employees on the floor.  Sometimes you need help and need to ask a question.  Well good luck here because you can't find anyone that works here except the cashiers up front.  What's the deal?\n\n3. When you do encounter an employee, they are not very nice.  Come one people, a smile every now and then is good for your soul, so smile!\n\n4.  I always forget about the self bagging.  Of course this is when I have a ton of stuff and a wiggly, into everything toddler with me.  It is like a stress heart attack just waiting to happen trying to get everything bagged and back in the cart.\n\nI do have to say that this location was super clean and the areas were displayed nicely, even if the aisles really didn't make sense."
1,"I went there a while back, maybe 6 months ago. My girlfriend and I went there for her lunch break and luckily, we landed upon their special hour/day. Their sushi was pretty decent, it was just a little over my price range if not for the specials. The service was okay but the sushi chef was really welcoming. I would go there again, but maybe only for a date and not as casual eating out."
0,"This place is such a waste of space, it's an absurdly overpriced dump.  Seriously I've been given the wrong sandwich all but 1 time I've been here and that time there was hair in the sandwich.  I only go here because I'm with someone who wants to eat here, I've never chosen this restaurant out of complete freedom of choice.  I can't say enough horrible this about this place save for the usual which is at bad as this place is there is worse out there."
1,"No doubt, this place is definitely poppin'.  I've gone to this place a few times now, and every single time, line is out the door.  Is it worth the wait?  Well that would a for sure \""Yes!\"", but I guess you can be the judge of that.\n\nThis last trip to Vegas, I actually had it twice.  One time my friends went and brought the food back to the hotel room.  The other was a dine-in experience.  This review will be based on the dine-in experience considering those are the kinds that actually really matter.\n\nAs mentioned before, line was out the door.  They did get a star docked for not making the line move faster.  I was hungry, and just the smell of the food was making my tummy do a little grumble mumble.\n\nFinally ordered and got the Loco Moco and Spam Masubi.  Girl like me loves my spam masubi.  Spam + Seaweed + Rice = YUM.  The Loco Moco was good too.  Two runny eggs, hamburger patty, and gravy, all over a bed of rice?  Can't really go wrong with that!  And who doesn't like using their egg yoke for sauce for their rice?  Or maybe that's just a filipino thing!  I also tried the soup off my friend's saimin.  The small order looks like a large, and could probably feed 2-3 people (at least, people who eat like me).  The broth was delicious, and I honestly would consider seeing if I can just order the broth next time!\n\nNote to all first timers, Cash only!  Yeah, any place that doesn't accept card is a disadvantage, but the food is just too good to pass up.  Not to mention, the prices aren't too bad either!"
1,good boba milk tea!  wonderful food. had the Mongolian beef and chicken wings w/ fried rice. the beef was subtely spicy and very flavorful. I will be back.
0,"Just don't stay here.  We chose this property for the smoke free and gambling free aspects so we would feel comfortable with our daughter.  There are no good restaurants and the pool was so windy they sent us to Aria.  Aria had a way better pool, but there was smoking and not another kid.  In fairness, the whole cheapo, weekend gettaway, family vacay during our daughters Spring Break was a bad idea.  Kids are just not a great idea for Vegas, despite all the kid friendliness that is suggested online."
1,"You know... when it comes to desserts a particular subgroup in the LV yelp scene has declared Snowflake as their common  place to end their nights after events. Truthfully, I liked Snowflake a lot for a ton of reasons, but I would rather \""check-in\"" at Art of Flavors any day. I don't think I have ever had service, ice cream, and espresso that could ever compare to this place. Not to mention the prices are really low. \n\nIf you are a tourist reading this review, I recommend stopping here during your next visit. Desyree's Art of Flavors truly is one of the best things we got here in Las Vegas. \n\nFor many years I declined to eat gelatto. The only times I ever ate it was at Caesar's Palace, Venetian, and the buffet at Rio. At Caesar's, I got piss awful service, and the smallest gelatto they had costed me $14.00. At Venetian the dude working there who was covered in tattoos and piercings had no clue what gelatto was. But he told me that their gelatto is pre-made at a different location. And the gelatto at the Rio buffet gave me aids. Here at Art of Flavors, the ingredients are all organic and natural. They ain't gonna use any artificial ingredients ever. And the service is incredible. No matter how busy it is, every single person will get individual attention.\n\nDon't neglect the espresso next time you come here. I noticed that not very many people wrote about it in their reviews. The espresso here is so strong that you need to drink it with a spoon because drinking it too fast could stop your heart. I've never had real European espresso in my life, and it impressed me. \n\nI had no doubt that this place was gonna be good since Amanda vouched for it, but I didn't know it was  gonna be the best restaurant for dessert in Las Vegas.  \n\nMy friend Mel asked \""where are all the 2, and 3 star reviews\""..... It's because the Korean and Chinese yelpers haven't found out about this place yet to rate it down. (Come on, take a joke guys! I'm just busting your balls)"
1,Love it! Love it! Love it! It's always so yummy!
0,"I stayed at the Residence Inn on a day trip with a buddy of mine back on the last weekend in August. (guys weekend away type of trip) The overall experience wasn't bad, but when I weigh the value there's definitely pros & cons.\n\nDue to full disclosure, let me say that this stay didn't cost me anything. My friend, I was traveling with, has an enormous amount of Marriott Reward Points and offered to treat for the room provided I drove. Obvious choice on my part. So after doing a little bit of research I've discovered that the value of the 1 Bedroom Suite we stayed in on that weekend would've been about $275/night (according to the Marriott's website, for 2 people, in that room, on that weekend). So based on that here's my thoughts... \n\nInitially we had booked a 2 Double Bed Studio, but while talking on the drive up we decided the 1 Bedroom Suite would be a better fit. My friend called from the road and had no problem switching rooms. \n\nWe were on time to hit Montreal at about 1pm on a Sat. afternoon, but then we ran into the always aggravating \""random selection\"" at the border. Just over 2 hours later we were back on the road, which put us at the hotel at about 3:30-4ish. They have an underground garage ($25/night, added to the hotel bill on arrival), and like most in the city it was extremely narrow with low ceilings (I wouldn't suggest an large SUV). So we parked and went to the lobby to check in. Unfortunately we were informed that the room wasn't ready yet, which was mildly annoying seeing as which Check In time is 3:00 and after the drive from Boston (including the border hassle) all I wanted was a shower and a change. But we had the girl behind the desk take our bags, did a quick wash in the lobby bathroom, and headed down to Peel Pub for some lunch & a few beers. \n\nBack to the hotel, and we could finally check in at around 5:15pm. The room was your basic 1 Bedroom Suite... It's very comparable in size & comfort to the Quality Inn on Crescent St., but the Quality Inn is about 1/2 the price.  Everything worked just fine. Both TVs, AC, bathroom, hot water, etc. The WiFi was very limited, we were barely getting 1 bar on any of our devices (1 Droid, 1 iPhone4, an iPad & 1 laptop). The pull-out bed in the couch was as comfortable (or uncomfortable) as most sofa-beds. \n\nOverall it was a very nice place, perfectly located for those looking to stay downtown... but normally it would be out of my price range. Based on only that fact, I can't see myself staying here in the future.  I'd recommend it for families on vacation (clean & very quiet at night), people traveling for business, or couples looking for a bit more of a upscale hotel."
1,"This clean and quiet coffee shop is a hidden gem in Seven Hills. If you love Sci-Fi, you'll love the ambiance! They have every sort of memorabilia from \""Planet of the Apes\"" facial prosthetics to a life size Yoda drinking coffee. Even the food has fun names such as Palpatine's Pastrami Panini and the Wrap of Khan. But don't worry, this place has much more to offer than just ambience if you are not a Sci-Fi fan. The food is fantastic and very reasonably priced. The baristas are fun and talkative. The chai tea is amazing! Also, they offer free fast wi-fi and have a TV for sporting events. We will be back!"
1,"My mother was lucky enough to win a $300 gift certificate to this place.  We used it for my husband's 30th bday party cake.  They were able to accomodate me and my special decorating requests for the cake.  I appreciated that.  However, they fought me on the frosting request.  I happen to hate fondant, but was told that's really all they use and if I didn't want to eat it I could just pick it off.  Yes, I suppose that's true, so they won.  In the end the cake looked amazing.  It was a surprise for my hubby but he went with me to pick it up.  He was surprised and loved the decor.  Tammie was there when we picked it up and she seemed genuinely happy that he liked it.  Staff helped me load it in my car.  My guests loved the decor and taste of the cake.  I got chocolate cake with chocolate fudge filling.  It was pretty good- $300 dollars good-? not so much.  I did get the chance on a separate occasion to taste the coconut cake; WOW!  Very good!"
1,"First night in vegas, we decided for a off the strip menu, sushi. Turned out this place has AYCE for $25.95. Since rolls are around $10-13 each, we decided AYCE (we were hungry). We sat at the bar, told the guy (Aaron?)  just give us what he recommends but also ordered some that sparked our interests. He was all smiles and kept them coming. Sashimi rolls are the best( he recommended).The waitress kept our counter cleared of any unwanted dishes without skipping a beat. Good price on the beer- $6.50 for large bottle.  Service was excellent and the food was great. I agree some rolls have a lot of sauce. Just tell the chef easy on the sauce..."
0,"I don't know what all the fuss is about, burgers are boring , the fries are basic the smash fries have way too much rosemary . Two burgers and one order of fries almost $17 , no thanks"
1,"Best beer selection in Scottsdale.  Best prices are during happy hour, make sure you get the chicken nachos!  Great place with a huge food and drink menu.  I was even able to take our Vegan friends here and they had plenty of food to order from."
1,"*** oops, didn't see that I had previously reviewed this place, so sorry if it sounds repetitious***\n\nWent there the other night with family visiting from out of town.  This is definitely the go to place to take visitors and has been for a long time.  Being a near native, I practically grew up here and it is still a wonderful experience.\n\nThe food is just okay in my opinion but the ambience and view more than make up for it.  \n\nOn our last visit, we started with the potato skins.  They make the best I've ever had.  Perfection.\n\nI had the big burger and it was just that - big.  I made it through half of it before calling it quits.\n\nVery cute that they give complimentary cotton candy at the the end of the meal and the kids loved getting balloon butterflies. \n\nLoved that we could go outside, relax and visit with family at the end of the night.\n\nOur visitors always end up leaving with one of the $35 rattlesnake head keychains.  Pretty unique from where they're from."
1,"[A version of this review will also be featured on the Holy Taco Church at http://www.holytacochurch.com/.]\n\nGadzooks! Enchiladas and Soup is a new place that I keep seeing mentioned on all the best-foods-in-Phoenix type lists.\n\nI ordered two tacos. My husband ordered enchiladas. I chose the \""50/50,\"" meaning half flour and half corn tortillas--this ended up being a good choice, because my husband went with corn and found they became extra toasty in the oven. \n\nNext up... MEAT. I was a bit confused about if I could combine meat with another non-meat main item, and it turned out I could.\n\nI chose to do two chicken and cornbread tacos. Cornbread. YES. Scooped out of a big casserole pan. Yelp said it was delicious, so I wanted to give it a shot!\n\nWith my tacos girded with chicken and chunks of cornbread, my food moved on down the food bar. Me, I love me some cheese, and here I asked for asadero and chihuahua cheese. My whole dish was stuck in the big oven to heat up for like two minutes as I waited and drooled. Next up, I asked for pico, crumbled cojita cheese (because cheeeeeeeese), vinaigrette slaw, and pickled onions. At this point, the dish looked like a delicious rainbow of awesomeness.\n\nI asked for a pumpkin cookie and was pleased that the order included two. BONUS COOKIE FTW. They also had lemon blueberry cookies and I'd love to try those sometime.\n\nSo, cornbread on a taco. Dude. This is amazing. Cornbread tastes awesome but it also has this soft/crunchy texture thing going on. It melds with the meat. Clouds opened up. Angels sang. Cornbread is good with everything on a Thanksgiving plate, and it totally works with zingy Mexican flavors. I need to try this combo at home.\n\nThe food was 100% awesome. Every topping I chose was fabulous. The slaw and onions added a tang and crunch that nicely complemented the holy fusion of cornbread and chicken.\n\nMy husband had a short rib and a pork enchilada. He was pleased. I asked for bites of his food to judge this. Well, it was more like a mugging. My fork loomed over his plate and he wisely surrendered the dish before I stabbed him. I agreed with his assessment.\n\nMeanwhile, our son had tortilla chips. They are awesome, all covered with bubbles, and thick enough that they can crackle and kinda explode when you bite into them. You could tell they are made there.\n\nThen we come to the cookies. The glaze on them turned out to be maple. MAPLE! Happiness! Rainbows! Fuzzy kittens! The cookies really tasted like homemade and were soft and chewy.\n\nWe loved Gadzooks. Awesome food with great options. Good prices ($6.95 to get two tacos or two enchiladas). It's earned all the buzz."
0,Pretty gross breakfast. The only reason they are getting any stars is because the waitress was nice enough to take some of the food off the bill when she asked how I liked it and I answered honestly
0,"Would have so enjoyed it more if during our conversation we did not have to scream to each other to be heard. We made the mistake of going on a late afternoon Saturday, between the blaring jukebox so loud that it made your ears almost bleed and the even louder mariachis playing in between the jukebox music, we couldn't even enjoy our meal. Don't think we will be back, although the food was good, it isn't worth the risk of going deaf!"
1,saw kristin today.  she listened to me and gave me an awesome cut.  highly recommend this place- i've been here 3x now and it hash't disappointed me.
1,Best buffet . It's expensive but it's worth it.
0,"Like everyone else, this place is a joke. They make you pay for liability insurance, and mind you I rent cars all the time. Nobody else makes you pay for that sh*t. And to be honesty all the people who work there are PAYLESS and I'm sure they get PAID just as LESS. There is no quality in cars, people, customer service and their prices are far from PAYLESS...I tried calling customer service b/c we will going to be late returning our rental and of course, nobody answers the phone for an hour and I even left a courtesy message to these A**holes to call me back and guess what, no return call. I guess I did PAYLESS for customer service. \n\nSo people pleeeese, if you are going to rent a car pleeeeese DO NOT use PAYLESS because you get what you PAY for. CRAP!!!!\nBelieve me the corporate office will be hearing from me and they just might get a nice call to the BBB!!! Merry Xmas!!!"
0,"This was my wife's and my second visit to this establishment.  Our initial visit was OK (not great but not bad) and it was only because of the manager's (a very friendly Korean gentleman) concerted efforts that we came back.  At the time, I asked him if the restaurant made a particular dish that I enjoyed in the San Fran. Bay area and while he said they do not, he would go into the kitchen and attempt to make it himself, on the house.  He aplogized for not making it exactly as I desired, but it didn't matter to me.  Clearly this manager was very focused on establishing regular clientele and his absolute attention to us convinced us to give the place another chance.\n\nWe came back and immediately noticed he was absent (our visits was less than 1 month apart). We figured it was his day off ... it turns out he had been fired.\n\nDuring our 2nd (and last) visit, my wife ordered the Lo Mein House entree and I decided to try the all-u-can eat sushi (I had previously tried the General Tso's chicken, and it was much too dry).  We were enjoying our meal and my wife decided to sample one of the sushi pieces on my plate.  We are married, both ordered entrees and frequently share our food.  Within mere moments, our waitress (who, with all due respect, needs to refine the manner in which she deals with customers) comes to us and tells us, and I quote: \""I saw you take one of the pieces of sushi from his plate and our policy is for no sharing. We won't charge you this time but don't take any more pieces.\"" \n\nI was stunned, immediately expressing that we each had placed entree orders (exceeding $10 per item) and we demanded to speak to the general manager.\n\nThe General Manager (a new fellow, given that the previous, very affable fellow had been released) is clearly not suited for this job.  He tried to argue, rather unsuccessfully, that what we had done was \""equivalent to stealing\"".  It mattered not one iota to him that we each had ordered an entree, as he continued with his \""the sushi is 19.95 per person\"", with emphasis on the \""person\"".  This implies, according to him, that there be no sharing (since we're being technical, \""No Sharing\"" is not stipulated on their scotch-tape put together menu).   He said he would do us a favor this time and not charge us an extra $19.95. \n\nI told the General Manager that there is no more certain way to ensure that he loses clientele than the way they treated us, and we absolutely have no intention to come back.  \n\nThe Nee House is the clear front-runner for excellent Chinese food in north Phoenix, while Ritz Asia, I expect, will be out of business within 1 year."
0,This used to be one of my favorite places until the last time I ordered a submarino and I found a piece of kitchen sponge in my sandwich \nI will try again soon because I have always had good experiences with Fazolis
0,"Is attention to detail important? Apparently not during my visit :(\n\nWaitress: would you like fruit?\nMe: no\nWaitress: sausage or bacon? \nMe: bacon\nWaitress: what to drink?\nMe: coffee\n\nWhat I got: fruit, sausage & during my entire visit NOTHING to drink. When I asked about my coffee I was told it was brewing. No one remembered anything about it again until it was time to put it on my check... seriously. I asked it be removed since I never got it and she just laughed and said, \""oh, I'm so sorry about that\"". Really? Because she didn't seem like she was. Especially when it took her almost 10 more minutes to get me my corrected check. \nI won't be visiting again."
0,"This place is overpriced and lacking in quality and flavor. Certainly great if in a bind if you are very hungry at 3 am after hanging in the village, but otherwise not worth it. The decor is unauthentic and really it just looks like it's been slapped together."
1,Great place for Brunch!
1,"Love this place, iv lived behind the sub factory for the past 4 years and more recently started going.. And now it's a 1-2 visits a week. Hot Pastrami! Roast beef melt.. Both amazing (something about the lightly toasted bread) and the hot italian. Please for your sake try this place and enjoy."
0,"Me and a friend ordered delivery through GrubHub, which was fine.  The bill, with tip, came to about $50 for two entrees and a dessert, which even for delivery seems high.  (I recently paid $65 for Chinese delivery to my office for four lunch specials, crab puffs, $8 delivery charge, and tip.)  I ordered the pineapple fried rice. I love spicy food. I'm the friend who makes fun of everyone else for eating things at 0 spiciness. I ordered this dish at a 6, thinking it would be on the hot side of medium spiciness. This was one of the spiciest dishes I have ever been served. It was inedible, because not only was it extremely spicy but the pineapples had been cooked so much they were completely flavorless, which is something I've never experienced before. So there was no balancing sweet flavor, it was just insane spiciness that overwheled everything. I am with a friend who also loves spicy food, and it was too much for him, too. He ordered another dish at a spiciness level of 3, which seemed to have no bite at all. Mine was definitely not twice as spicy as his, it was at least 10 times as spicy. I've ordered 8s and 9s that weren't this hot. He also was weirded out by the totally flavorless pineapple. \n\nMy friend's level 3 completely unspicy dish was fine; it was crab fried rice.  It wasn't anything special; just regular fried rice with a little bit of crab.  We ended up sharing that because neither of us could stomach mine.\n\nI am addicted to sticky rice. It's one of my all-time favorite desserts. Bangkok Thai's sticky rice came in a sealed plastic bag, apparently directly out of the microwave, with a coconut milk sauce that didn't have nearly enough sugar. It was overall bland, I tried some of the nuts that were on the side with it; they turned out to be peanuts, which I don't love to begin with, but when a couple of peanuts totally overwhelm the taste of what you're eating, you know that it's not very flavorful. The coconut custard was OK, but not amazing. I've definitely had better. I used to live near Thai Lotus and would frequently get delivery from them; their sticky rice with custard was AMAZING. I'm really sad there's no decent non-pizza places that deliver to my new apartment. \n\nFor a $50 delivery order, I was extremely disappointed. Worst $50 I've ever spent on a meal."
1,"We ate here the last night of our Vegas trip. It's yer basic steakhouse...reminded me of Ruth's Chris....ala carte style which some people complain about but I don't see what the big deal is. \n\nStarted off with their loaded baked potato bread. Not sure of the complaint from another Yelper about it arriving in a paper bag. But I thought it was cute. It was a loaded potato bread with melted cheese and tiny bits of bacon throughout the bread and a sour cream chive butter. I thought it was awesome. I'm a \""baked potato with everything on it\"" kind of girl, so I lovveeddd the bread.\n\nMy choice was the 8 oz Filet Mignon. I never had it \""butterflied\"" before, so I said yes once the waiter explained to me. Not like it could hurt it right? I choice a loaded baked potato as my side and also got a peppercorn sauce for my steak. I was surprised that the \""garnish\"" was a whole roasted bulb of garlic. Scorreeee!!! Roasted garlic is the bomb! Why hasn't anyone else served roasted garlic with a steak?? Very nice touch!!! My filet was perfectly cooked and was sooo tender, the sauce was tasty, the baked potato was huge and the garlic added a wonderful extra touch and flavor!\n\nAlso had the Kobe Beef kabob which was served on this huge metal knife skewer thing which the staff removed for us. There was yummy onions and mushrooms and an accompanying gravy sauce that they poured over the beef and the mashed potatoes. That was the first time I tasted Kobe beef and man, it just melted in my mouth. Amazing piece of beef!! Also had the broccolini as a side dish which was a huge portion.\n\nWe couldn't pass up dessert so we ordered the Coco Puffs with Creme Brulee Ice Cream because I saw a nearby table order it and the presentation seemed cool. LOL! The coco puffs arrived still hot, but they were in the paper bag (just like the bread). Then they poured the coco powder in the bag and shook it all up to coat the puffs and then poured them on the side of the crme brulee ice cream. The coco puffs were like little cake/donut balls. I thought it was a very tasty and cute dessert. The ice cream also had chocolate ball things in it that was a cool touch.\n\nExcellent service and tasty food. I'd definitely come back for dinner on the next trip to Vegas!\n\np.s. See my uploaded pictures of all the yummy goodness!"
1,"What a nice place. \n\nSpread out over a hillside in the desert, Sanctuary Resort is just that: sanctuary. The resort has nature all around - hummingbirds, flowering everything, road runners, jack rabbits and more - really beautiful. \n\nThe rooms are exceptional. My suite included a private deck with mountain views, big shower with slate tile and double shower head, four poster bed and flat screed TV. In the main room - fireplace (not necessary for my mid-July nightly lows around 95F), dining room table and big L-couch in front of the 50 in. flat screen.\n\nDown the hill is Elements bar and restaurant with great views and exceptional service. The restaurant overlooks the spa pool. And there, during the day when temperatures are around 110 degrees, there is plenty of lemon water, fresh towels and floaties. One can't help but relax and dream. \n\nMy days were a mix of business and pleasure so I didn't check out the spa proper (or the lap pool or the work-out center for that matter). I did find space plenty of opportunity to shed some stress however.\n\nNotes:\n+ One of the huge pluses is that the resort is less than a mile from Echo Canyon Parkway (the trail head that has a parking lot for Camelback Mountain trail). I did manage to hike part of Camel Back on this trip which is good. But it is not so good that I did not get to the top due to time constraints. I've hiked Camelback many times and it is a must do for any visit to Phoenix.\n\n+ I really did not mind the heat - in fact I sort of like it. But this is the off season for Arizona and that translates to huge value in hotels and resorts. \n\n- The pool area has a no cell phone policy - which is fantastic! What is not so fantastic is the moron who completely ignored it yesterday even after being asked by the staff to cease or move. So while I was relaxing I got to hear his entire conversation with Donna: He's from the east coast - in Phoenix for a few days to see the office there and is thinking bout relocating. Then he's off to Toronto next week on business and dreams of living in San Diego some day - blah blah blah.  Hey cell phone guy - learn some manners.\n\nBut even that one small diversion didn't manage to pull me up and out of my stress shredding objective. Overall 5 stars for a sanctuary in the desert."
0,"Dude.\n\nso we took our truck there to be serviced on a friday morning before a trip to the snow in utah... basic diagnostic, oil change...\nthat kind of service.. we were told it'd be done that evening and they'd give us a call when we could pick it up. \n\nso my husband tells them, please call us tonight... we need the car tomorrow morning. \n\nthey call us around 4:30 and leave a message on the answering machine  to say they were almost done and that they'd give us a call when we could come and pick it up.. estimated a time of 5-530.  \n\nwe weren't anywhere crazy that evening since we were waking up at 3am to drive to utah, so there was no way we could miss the call... \n\n6:00 comes around and my husband decides that it's time to call them.\nno ones picks up...  \n\nwe live down the street, it takes like 2 minutes to get there in our car, so my husband drives there at around 6:05.  they close at 6 so it would seem that they'd close shop around 6:15-6:20 just to get everything locked and cleaned up...  they were gone.  no one was there.... \n\nthey don't even have an answering machine, probably cause they get yelled at to much.  \n\nwhen we finally did come to pick my baby they weren't as apologetic as they should have been.  i had my husband demand a percentage taken off for no coming through on their end.... they gave us 20% off and a coupon [that you can get in your mailer] for our next visit. \n\nunfortunately, their will be no next visit."

1,"I've eaten breakfast here twice while staying at TI and haven't been disappointed. You get full and if you add some salt and pepper to your entree it's pretty tasty.  Service was good and the food came quick.  Typical breakfast for 2 including juice or coffee ran about $55 with tip, which is pretty steep.  I'm not kicking myself - my company paid for it!"
0,Pretty bland for Chinese take out.
0,"Oh my... I hate having to give a bad review, but the food here was not good at all. I give the 2 stars for the service, as our server was very attentive. \n\nThe atmosphere is fun, the location is great, but the food is just overpriced yuck. My husband said it was probably the worst meal he's had in Vegas. He had a pulled pork sandwich with his side dishes put in ramekins, more size suited for condiments. I'd ordered chicken wings and a side of fries. My chicken wings tasted like extra salty hotdogs. Not sure how that happened? Our kids had mac&cheese, and a kids cheeseburger. The cheeseburger looked fine, but my daughter wouldn't eat it because of the char grill. She's like Hank from 'King Of The Hill'  - wants to \""taste the meat, not the heat.\""   \n\nI can say with sincerity that I will not be back. Looks like a cool enough bar though. Stop for a drink, but pass on the food. There are so many better choices out there!"

We were there at 5:45 and had no problems being seated right away. \n\nWe had the #14 nam kao tod meat salad, garlic prawns, tom kha gai soup and crispy duck on drunken noodles.  It was a lot of food, enough for a doggie bag for later too.  \nTo drink, Thai ice tea (creamy almost like an iced coffee) and a Thai Lime drink  (refreshing but too sweet, ask for less sugar). \n\nTotal came to around $75.00 for the two of us.  \n\nNow, I may be crucified for this but, it wasn't knock my socks off amazing.  It was delicious, but I've been spoiled with Thai food here in Toronto.  We go to Express Thai on Dufferin which is owned and operated by a Thai family, and I feel the flavours there are just as fresh and authentic as Lotus of Siam.  We ordered all the things that were rec'd to us, but next time I'll have to be a bit more adventurous with our choices to really experience the magic of this place."
1,"I give it 4 1/2 close to 5 stars. First time staying here. Chose it because of the price, the fact it had a fridge, the room looked spacious and it said it was close to Old Town. Was not disappointed! Rooms are so spacious, beds comfy, it was nice having a couch, hotel is well kept, lobby was nice, staff friendly, continental breakfast was good. Only one downfall but not worth not staying here again or recommending to family/friends is how small the bathroom (shower/toilet only) is plus poor lighting. Old Town is literally 2 blocks up which is perfect because there're cute shops everywhere."
1,"Lovely, lovely, lovely"
0,"Home of the incredible exploding burrito. This place is awesome if you want to wear your food. Actually, that might be better than eating it. :("
1,"Cheap! doesn't necessarily mean bad - at least not here at the Stan's Market. However, you will definitely have to check, double check and triple check on some occasions before you buy anything.\n\nWe stop here twice a month to do our groceries - mostly for less likely perishable produce like the garlic, ginger, peppers, baby cucumbers. However, we usually end up buying a lot more than that since we cook on a daily basis. If you happen to buy some of the soft fruits like the strawberries, blue berries or the grapes - you will most likely need to finish it up with in a day or two. If not, you can always freeze them to make smoothies.\n\nLet me say this again, this place is cheap. The prices I pay for the produce here are usually 1/3 of the price I pay at Giant Eagle. So, if you know your produce - this is definitely the place to stop."
1,"On a business trip in WI and wanted to try something different for supper.  I definitely found a great type of food that I have managed to miss until now.  Korean food may replace Thai as my favorite Asian food.  I had the kimchi jjigae which is a kind of cabbage stew with onions and lots of other wonderful veggies.  I had the tuna but could have chosen pork.  The tuna was wonderful and the soup brought together so many wonderful tastes and textures that I will definitely be searching for Korean food when I get back home!  I began the meal with an order of spring rolls which were crispy as few restaurants can accomplish.\n\nService could not have been better.  If you are in Middleton, Wi and looking for some awesome combinations of subtle spices, warm and friendly service and an enjoyable evening, you should definitely try this place!"
0,Beware of the kids computer area. I am at this library twice a week and the kids there are always cussing and acting inappropriate. The first time I heard them I told a lady in the homework room and she told me to go to youth desk and report it. She did nothing. Told them i saw an 11 year old watching straight up porn from youtube. The manager didn't even go through the history and said it was an accident and he couldn't remember what he clicked on. She told him that they needed to know so they could block it. That's it! This kid intended to watch it and maximized it for a whole 3 minutes. My 7 year old daughter just got an eye full and I am not happy with management's reaction.

0,"Thai Express is one of the places that I would not mind going when I need food quickly or when I simply do not want to cook for the night. I tried this one and ordered for a to-go. Now I do not plan to go back at all because of two reasons.\n\nFirst, it's dirty. The place is really dirty that I could see flies on limes (yes, they were sitting on them) and the ceiling.. It looked like they do not clean until the store closes. It was a bit.. disgusting.\n\nSecond, it's salty. VERY salty. Food was very oily too. The to-go box looked like a garbage can after it dried... I actually couldn't finish eating because it was too salty. I had to drink at least 1L of water after to remove that salty feeling on my tongue..."
0,"We stay at Mandalay each year for an annual golf tournament, so MIX lounge is conveniently upstairs. Its definitely not a club like the others along the strip... Just a chill place to grab drinks. The dance floor is small, and pretty much non-existent. The crowd is older... No young hotties. The DJ wasn't that great the last time I was there either.. He didn't know how to transition songs! But the view is great though... Cant get a better view of the strip than from MIX! They also have an open-air balcony if you wanna get some fresh air..."
1,"I gave this to my fiance as a belated Birthday gift.  We had a great time.  Pete was fun, personable, and a very patient teacher.  He even let us sail longer than the two hours since it was the end of the day.  My fiance had a ball.  At one point the wind was so strong, he and a couple of other guys were trying to race the cars running along I-15!  Definitely would love to do this again and will recommend everyone to give it a try if you like speed and the wind on your face."
0,"My fiance and I came into this Walmart and famished we decided since there was a sonic and we've been mcdonalds'd out we would try something different so we ordered and the prices are really getting ridiculous for fast food. The cashier looked bored and was super rude and this was after we were trying to joke with her. Then I wanted to have something to put my ketchup in so I could dip my tots in and two girls smiled at me but never asked me if I needed something and even walked past me a couple times, until the cashier finally \""saw\"" me and asked what I needed and even when I said in a chipper way \""thank you\"" she just looked on zombie like. My fiance wanted a refill on his regular sized drink (coke) and was charged $0.86 which is really ridiculous! If they wanted to they could just refill the cup instead of providing a brand new one.... We walked out having spent $16 and were very disappointed with the food and service- this place is almost enough to stop me from visiting other Sonic Restaurants."
1,"4.5 stars\n\nWe had some really good Empanadas with Guava and Cream Cheese... WOW!  They were very good and sweet!\n\nI had the Ropa Vieja (#31) (Shredded beef, bell peppers, onions, and Creole sofrito, in a savory sauce) with a side of Moros (White rice that is cooked with black beans and topped with saut\u00e9ed garlic and oil).\n\nMy wife had the  Frijoles Negros (black bean soup with white rice on the side) and Yuca Frita (Fried yuca wedges).  Both of hers were very good too! \n\nWe both WAY over ate!   We met the owners of the restaurant and found out that they have only been here for 2 months and now have their liquor license.  We will be going back!"
1,"I myself LOVE five guys, i always get the double cheeseburger (i havent been there in a while so im not sure if thats what its called)....it will fill you to the gills,not to mention that their hotdogs are expecially good as well,also the free peanuts are a plus plus plus......but if it is one thing that gets me is that the food is insanely priced...i mean don't get me wrong,the taste is original...you just may never have another burger like it....but seems like everytime Me and my wife step in the door we walk away atleast $20 shorter!!!!!!!!!!!! It's a burger joint guys....let's bring it down to burger joint prices please!!!!!!!!!"
1,I LOVE this restaurant. It's officially my favorite all time place to eat. I usually get the same thing everytime but I don't care it's seriously the freshest best food I've ever eaten.
1,Baseball in uptown Charlotte makes me excited to be a Charlotte resident. BB&T park is a fantastic location near the new Romare Bearden park and the Panther's stadium. If taking the light rail just pop off at the 3rd St/Convention Center stop and its a less than five minute walk to the ballpark.\n\nI was impressed with the range of food options from Queen City Q to froyo there was an option for those that don't want a pretzel or hot dog. \n\nif coming with a group your tickets can come pre-loaded with dollars to spend at the ballpark- thanks office! :)\n\nI heard parking was easily found for around $4. Beers are pricey but local craft brews are the same price as a Bud Light so score a premium beer if that's your style.\n\nI'm glad this stadium is here and I hope people continue to frequent games even after the shine of a new stadium has worn off.
1,"Natty Light, Busch & PBR in a can. Champagne in a bottle and a killer bloody mary menu makes \""The Beav\"" a unique stop any night. Great country music playing in the free jukebox and a diverse crowd to match the beer selection are just a few of the great reasons to visit this 2+ year dive bar. You'll feel welcome if it your first visit or you're a regular."
1,"I've been wanting to try this restaurant since it opened, but never had a chance. Knowing this, my husband surprised me with a reservation here for my birthday dinner. The food was as good as expected, and changed my mind about a few non favorite items. They have two different sections to the menu a cold menu and a hot menu. The cold menu has mostly crudo, veggies and raw items and the hot menu were heavier cooked items. We went with the following:\n\nCold Menu:\nTako & Tomato:\nDelicious grilled octopus with fresh mozzarella & tomato, an unexpected combo that works\n\nShiromi Carpaccio: \nThinly sliced raw white fish with a hot sesame oil w/focaccia to sop up the sauce. This was also delicious and if you're looking for some more substance to your appetizer the focaccia was a great addition\n\nGrapefruit & Yellowtail:\nMy favorite appetizer, a fantastic mix of sweet and savory with sweet grapfruit and perfectly fresh yellowtail, a must try!\n\nHot Menu:\nSoft Shell Crab Salad:\nI was leery of ordering this, I'm not a fan of soft shell crab because any time I've eaten it I've found it to be very fishy. Apparently I've been eating it at the wrong places (chain sushi restaurants) because I loved the crab in this dish. The panko crusted crab was delicious and fresh tasting, not fishy at all. The fresh vegetables and herbs were a fantastic addition along with the peanuts and nuac cham fish sauce. I guess I need to be more selective of where I order my soft shell crab as it turns out I am a fan, I just haven't ever eaten the fresh stuff until now.\n\nWarm Duck Salad:\nDuck has never been my top pick either, but the menu description sounded enticing and it turned out to be a great choice too! The duck was cooked perfectly and the grilled greens were equally as good.\n\nCoconut Curry Lamb:\nLike the two other choices, lamb has never been my favorite either. I was really trusting tonight, and am glad that I reached out of my comfort zone because this dish was amazing! Like the other two dishes the lamb was cooked perfectly medium rare and had a light coconut curry flavor. I really liked how the curry flavor was underlining as to not overpower the lamb flavor. The mango fennel salad was a great side to this dish.\n\nDessert:\nChocolate cake with white chocolate green tea ice cream - I wasn't expecting this dessert to really stand out, as I don't typically order dessert in Asian restaurants, but it was my birthday and it was given to us complimentary for the occasion. This dessert was as good as the rest of the meal, the cake was rich and the ice cream was delicious and had great flavor. \n\nI will definitely return to Nobuo, it made me a fan of dishes that I typically don't care for, because the ingredients were top notch and the dishes were prepared perfectly. The service as amazing too, our waitress' recommendations were spot on. My only complaint was that I wasn't a huge fan of the cocktails, they weren't bad just not to my taste. So the next time I return I'll have some pre-drinks at Rose & Crown or Bar Bianco and then have my meal at Nobuo."
1,"This is the best Thai I have found in Mesa.  We had a variety of things off the menu, from appetizers to curry to stir-fry. All were excellent and portions were generous!  Good water (not that awful tasting city water) was a nice bonus.  Friendly service, too.  Will definitely be a repeat customer.  Probably tomorrow."
1,This place has never disappointed me. Whether i use the drive-thru or walkin inside. I stack up on a dozen and love how a few more always find there way inside. The donuts are light and airy and dont feel weighted down if you get a creme filled. The frosting on top arent over sugary. Love the bear claws and always having chocolate milk on hand to wash it down with is a plus. \n\nBefore i leave the parking lot im usually missing a few donuts.
1,Monkey Mocha is the best coffee choice here. I was amazed at how good it is and no other drink here compares. I have my new craving now!
1,"have a great flavor of yoghurt. the taste is not common yoghurt taste (tart)\nthey are more like a ice-cream flavor yoghurt, sweet and flavorful.\nthe price seems high compare to other places.\nthe address posted in yelp need to be change."
0,"I have gone there 3 times, all on different days of the week and times and it's still FAIL. \n\nThere is really nothing to do, outside of eating and shopping at places that you get at any other place in Las Vegas. Nothing new, nothing exciting and unique. Once you park and walk in, you start to get excited because the architecture and scene is nice and looks the part. But after walking for about 5 more minutes, you realize that there is nothing else to see. \n\nI think they are wayyy behind Town Square. Actually, I will bypass this place and go to Town Square for family fun and entertainment. At least T.S has a movie theater, better name brand shopping and restaurants. \n\nI would rank Tivoli and The District equal to each other. \n\nI will give them one more chance to keep me as a customer. They have to give the locals something else that we haven't seen."
0,"Decor: Amazing decor. Modern and great lighting.\n\nHow it relates to Chinese food? Not sure. But I like how it doesn't go for \""Orientalism\"" design that establishments can easily fall into. That's why I gave it a second star.\n\nFood: If it wasn't for the Interior Decoration, this place would have gotten a 1-Star.\n\nWe ordered Jelly Fish, Yang Chow Fried Rice, Salt & Peppered Shrimp, Chow Mein Noodles, and Hot Tea.\n\n1) Portions were small. I'm not sure if it's because they consider themselves a Gourmet Restaurant, if that's the case, then I should deduct points for presentation. \n\nPresentation? There is none... it's just served on a plate like a regular Chinese Restaurant.\n\n2) Taste. None to Bland. Out of all the dishes we ordered, I only enjoyed the Salt & Peppered Shrimp. It was crispy, not too greasy, not really spicy.\n\n3) Service was bad. Servers are as attentive and personable as a regular Chinese Restaurant. Which I don't mind, when I'm eating at family owned Chinese Restaurants. But I expect better service when I'm ordering plates that are $16 - $20 at the lowest.\n\n- The Host was a young woman who didn't smile or didn't make us welcome... That's your job as a host!!! \n\n4) Price. Crazy!\nI don't understand how they justify charging people for this place. The Thai Iced Tea is $6.99..... Yup, you read that right. \n\nI would seriously question the pallet of any person that gave this place more than 3 stars. My advice, just go to Chinatown and find yourself a family owned restaurant."
1,"Barrio Cafe is a great up-scale Mexican restaurant in the heart of downtown Phoenix! \n\nSince 2002, Phoenicians (local Phoenix residents) and tourists have been flocking to Barrio Cafe to check out Wendy Gruber and Silvana S. Esparza's amazing concoctions! Cooking up authentic southern Mexican cuisine, Barrio Cafe is worth checking out if you are visiting Phoenix!\n\n[devour]\n*BREAD & OLIVE TAPENADE (complimentary, **3 STARS**) http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/barrio-caf\u00e9-phoenix-2?select=-n9S3iox-mxfPDf1nQOn1Q#hotQFFC1GATHL5k4SK9RlA\nI love toasted bread and I found it interesting that there was a type of olive tapenade accompanied with this in a Mexican restaurant. I must say though, I like the concept, but I wasn't sure how it fits in with the Barrio Cafe theme and authenticity of Mexican cuisine. The olives were rich in sodium, so I needed to drink water to dilute the saltiness. Nonetheless, it was out-of-the-box, interesting, but nothing too memorable for me.\n\n*GUACAMOLE CASERO & CHIPS ($10.50, **5 STARS**) http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/barrio-caf\u00e9-phoenix-2?select=-n9S3iox-mxfPDf1nQOn1Q#MeFFk_MnYU7HeBUO3kpXYg\nI've fallen in love with their guacamole! I'm a guacamole slut and love everything about this dish! First and foremost, who puts pomegranate seeds in their guac?! They do! This gave a bit of sweetness, which complimented the acid from your typical guacamole ingredients. Prepared table side and made in a jiffy! I was impressed with this dish and would order it again! \n\n*COCHINITA PIBIL ($19, **5 STARS**) http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/barrio-caf\u00e9-phoenix-2?select=-n9S3iox-mxfPDf1nQOn1Q#3TUF75Ror8SVevRy-CoaNA\nThis dish is their FAMOUS 12-hour slow roasted pork marinated with achiote rojo (Mexican spices)! As you can imagine, the pork was quite succulent and there was a side of au jus in case you wanted more \""oomph\"". The pork was topped off with salsa Yucateca, which elevated the flavors of the pork's richness! The dish was served with sauteed veggies and a sweet potato mash. It is a heavy dish to consume, but nonetheless, amazing dish that is taste-bud worthy! I can see why this is the popular dish amongst the visitors and regulars! Get it if you can!!! *oink*oink*  \n\n*CARNE ASADA TACOS ($14) http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/barrio-caf\u00e9-phoenix-2?select=-n9S3iox-mxfPDf1nQOn1Q#3NI_va9ekIdN_V8MzGYahw\n*FILETE AZUL (Filet Mignon) ($26) http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/barrio-caf\u00e9-phoenix-2?select=-n9S3iox-mxfPDf1nQOn1Q#lsSphM27AH9f18-2r00T7A\n-I can't attest to the other two dishes since I did not try my fellow grubbers' dishes. But both were content with the dishes they had ordered that evening. \n\n[imbibe]\n*HORCHATA http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/barrio-caf\u00e9-phoenix-2?select=-n9S3iox-mxfPDf1nQOn1Q#wACvkrnyMEzHvYvvJh1iAA \nBarrio Cafe was honored a couple years ago for having the most authentic horchata in town. As I had a glass of it (served in a glass Coke bottle), I was expecting the drink to be over-ly sugared! Surprisingly, it was quite tamed and it was refreshing to drink throughout my dinner here. \n\nFYI =\n*No reservations - it's a first come, first serve kinda place (so expect to wait)\n*Closed on Mondays!\n*Parking on the street or nearby neighborhood lots\n*Nearby a random strip mall\n*Brunch served on Sundays only (11 AM - 3 PM)\n*HH Tuesdays - Fridays (3-5 PM)\n*They carry 250 types of TEQUILA!!!!\n*The restaurant's walls has plaques and awards for their food and service over the years!\n*If you love their food, you can find their 2nd location at PHX Sky Harbor Restaurant for their food to-go!  \n\nService - our hostess was quite busy, she forgot to let us know how long we would have to wait to be seated. We didn't really have to wait too long (15 mins) and she apologized for the delay. Our waiter was quite attentive and was able to answer any of the questions we had about the menu. Our water glasses were filled promptly and although the restaurant was quite busy, they didn't forget anything we had requested! Thank you for your service!\n\nOverall, I had a great experience with the Barrio Cafe and would recommend this place to someone if they are looking for an upscale kinda Mexican restaurant. I wouldn't mind coming back for their guacamole, since they put a twist to the original dish! \n\nYelp 2013 100 for 100 Challenge - Review #25"
1,"This place is a swell place to find some yummy treats. I came by a few weeks ago and basically purchase a mini of all the flavors I know I like. The original butter, cinnamon toast, and the banana never made it home from the car ride. I love that the mini size is a perfect little choice for a snack and it's only $1.75 each. I want to try the choco popcorn next.\n\nI saw a person come in with an empty tin while I was there. Apparently they got it for X-mas and wanted a refill. What was awesome is if you have bought a tin, you get %50 off when you go to refill! Great deal. I love this little local place."
1,"Everyone who knows me knows how much I love tacos. I've had a lot of tacos in a lot of different places, and these were pretty top notch. So many different types of meat! And a cart full of fresh cilantro, Pico De Gallo, and tomatoes! I didn't know what half the sauces consisted of, but what I put on was delicious. The red sauce (I think a tomatillo sauce?) was the spiciest thing I've ever put in my mouth. I was dying. It was awesome. I can't wait to go back and get more. The only thing I was really missing was some cheese! Where was the cheese?"
0,"Located in the Elara Hilton Grand Vacations hotel where I was staying, I decided to grab my normal cup of fancy coffee that I usually get.  The line was pretty long and it did take a while to get my drink b/c of that but I am an addict so I will wait!  As someone else mentioned, this Starbucks is extremely pricey!  Boy was there some sticker shock for me!  What normally costs me about $4 at another hotel near where I live was now $5.41.    If this was the price I had to pay every morning, I think my addiction may just go away.   I had no problems with the customer service and found them friendly.  I just wish my coffee was not so expensive!"
1,"You can find discounts galore at this store,\n\nIf you don't mind expired, slightly damaged, or nearly expired goods.\n\nSelection varies all the time, and you can find unusual items as well as regular grocery store goods.\n\nFor instance, when we went they had gallons of caffeine free coke syrup, bottles of yuzu juice, and a giant tin of British mustard powder."

0,"Don't be confused by the bar portion of this place; there is a restaurant on one side that serves food 24/7. This particular restaurant has its appeal, but falls short on the one thing it should be known for--the steaks. \n\nI'm a harsh critic of steak places because I expect my meat to be cooked but it burned and tasting of blackened crust. Unfortunately, my steak tasted more like smoke and burn than anything. I ordered the ribeye and it was okay, but it wasn't seasoned. If it was, the burn taste overpowered it. The other thing that threw me off was the crust that forms on mash when it sits for a few minutes at the window. That turned me off. \n\nI admit there is one thing that was okay, that being a lobster bisque. So, if you want to go for soup, head there. Otherwise, go somewhere else for a cut of meat. \n\nI'll update this review in 6 months. I hope it improves with time."
0,"So expensive and unsatisfying.  If it wasn't because my options were limited on Thanksgiving, I would've never given Caffe Boa a chance.  But I was desperate and hungry so Caffe Boa was the first of our string of disappointing dining experiences in Central Arizona.\n\nOk, I've had worse but I've definitely also eaten far better food in my life.  The best part of the meal was the free bread. It was actually very good and the dipping sauces (especially the chipotle one) were tasty.\n\nWe ordered the Shrimp Adriatico ($10) to start.  As far as paid dishes go, the appetizer was the best thing we got.  The sauce was marinara-esque with a tang.  If you don't like acidity, you will not like this. The flatbread was delicious and it's also fun to soak up the sauce with the complimentary regular bread as well. \n\nWe also ordered Lobster Ravioli ($22), Angus Burger ($16), and Voodoo Penne ($8 half portion).   The Lobster Ravioli may be the most overpriced, overrated dish on the menu.  Are you serious?  $22 for 5 tiny ravioli?  I would love to see what a half portion is.  What's worse is that the filling tasted like imitation crab.  It was the worst thing on the table. You would think a burger is a safe bet but nope, not the case either.  I know we didn't ask for well-done but the burger, bun and fries came out beyond well-done.  Everything was charred.  $16 for a burger is more than I'd pay for most \""gourmet\"" burgers in LA. Finally, let's talk about the Voodoo Penne.  This was actually an excellent value compared to everything else.  A half portion is more than enough for the average individual for lunch.  At only $8, that's pretty good.  Too bad the pasta tasted very average - kind of like the type of pasta I can make at home in 10 minutes.\n\nIt was 1:30pm on Thanksgiving and there were only 2 other tables of people at the restaurant. You would think that if there are 2 servers for only 3 tables of patrons, the service would be excellent.  Instead, the servers often mysteriously disappeared for 5 or 10 minutes at a time.  My friends did ask for a lot of hot water with lemon and honey.  We appreciate all of the free lemon slices, honey, and bread we received. Unfortunately, that was the highlight of our meal."
0,"Their website is not up to date, searched for an apartment I liked. Not only did they say there were no units available to view, but that the unit that currently shows as available has never been offered at the posted price. It has not been available since May.

0,"Let me start by saying....I used to be a big fan of this place. I would bring visiting friends there, recommend it to my clients from out of town as a must visit and eat, but that was years ago. When service was top notch, the portions were plentiful, and the food was great.\n\nNow, when I receive a plate here (pulled port sandwich), I wonder what happened?\n\nMy food was absolutely tasteless, and the sweet side potato which I paid $4 (price+tax+tip)....or should I say \""my half a sweet potato\"" was clearly cut in half to add to the bottom line. It's a far cry from when they served decent portions of tasty food. It makes me wonder what other short cuts they have considered. I didn't realize there was a national shortage of sweet potato and a well dressed, cooked potato could cost me over $8 American dollars.\n\nWhen I asked the Manager about the portion size, he simply stated \""that's how we do it\"".\n\nThank you, but no thanks!"

Can't wait for my next visit to The Park."
0,"In a word: run for your effing life.\n\nAfter reading the review on it in the New Times, we decided to hit this place with some friends. It was the first time for all of us, and to be fair, we are not of the \""Scottsdale\"" scene and that was definitely part of the problem.\n\nI'll make this simple:\nIssue #1: Made reservations for 8:30 and even though almost every table was open, we couldn't be seated for a good 15 minutes.\nIssue #2: Um, is this place a restaurant or a dance club? A DJ fired up at 9p and it wasn't music you could ignore. It was like eating in \""Trainspotting\"".\nIssue #3: Gigantic, pointy rock in the middle of the \""dance floor\""\nIssue #4: $12 for four TINY SLIVERS of tuna that wouldn't make an anorexic full.\nIssue #5: Over an hour to get our meals, which were served one at a time, apparently whenever they were ready.\nIssue #6: Did I mention there was a DJ?\nIssue #7: The crowd was of the Paris Hilton type, which I was expecting, considering. However, my friend summed it up perfectly, when she said, \""This is the kind of place where you can see a 40 year old puking in the bathroom around 10pm.\"" Well done, my friend.\nIssue #8: The service: horrendous. Our server actually admitted to us that the kitchen crew was hammered because they'd been at the Scottsdale Culinary Fest all day. I'm sure they remembered to wash their hands, though. \n\nOther than that, it was fine."
1,"Nice alternative to Chipotle. They offer whole wheat tortillas and brown rice (cant imagine healthy but tasty) and cabbage for your burrito. Had chicken, very good and with the cabbage it is huge. The fish tacos are also good. Want to try a bowl sometime."
0,"Wife and I stopped recently for lunch.  She ordered the chicken wrap; me the Chinese chicken salad.  It took nearly 30 minutes to get the order filled.  Waitress apologized.  Said the chicken was being fresh cooked.  Manager finally came by and offered us a free tapas to ease the wait (nice touch).  But when dishes finally arrived, I found about 5 pieces of chicken in my heaping salad that taste wise had been compromised by an over generous drenching of some kind of dressing (sesame oil, I think) that produced more heat than taste.  Wife's wrap was more robust with chicken, but not noticeably fresh cooked.  Overall, a poor experience."
1,I have been to two Americas taco shops and both were good but this location was a little better. They also have the yelp check I. For free chips which is awesome. I love the chips they remind me if the chips from Taco del Mar. The bean burrito is good. The tacos seem to vary depending on how long the meat is cooked. Defiantly a place to check out if you like Mexican food in the style of chipotle or taco del mar.
1,"I had such a spectacular experience at Barrelhouse last night that I now feel that it's a mission to tell everyone about this place.  My friends, my mom, Yelp, random strangers on the street....everyone.\n\nDon't be thrown that this place is in a strip mall between a video store and a boba tea shop.  If you didn't see the massive parking lot out of the window, you'd forget all about it once you're inside.  The decor is welcoming, with a mix of booths, high-tops near the bar, and a few couches in the corner.\n\nWatermelon Collins was my drink of choice for the evening.  Perfectly balanced, deliciously summery, and one of the best cocktails that I've had this year.  The rest of their drinks looked equally intriguing - I'll have to drag a few friends along next time so we can compare.\n\nThe goat cheese crepe was a generous portion with a touch of balsamic vinegar to give it a kick (the real stuff).  I yummed and ahhed through the whole entree.  The real delight, however, was the berry apple crisp.  I can't even begin to describe just how good it was.  I would go back on the merits of the dessert alone.\n\nIt's clear the kitchen and bar staff know their trade.  I hope this place is the new Postino's for the East Valley."
1,"The service is really friendly here.  I like how it feels personal and how the staff remembers you.\n\nI don't remember ever getting much of a wait in line - either that's because their service is so quick or I just hit it right sometimes.\n\nMeat is good, and they're not stingy.  I like the condiments/toppings, especially the pickles.  Tomatoes are fresh and good, too."
1,This is my go to place for breakfast. Everything I've ever had is delicious. I take all my out of town friends here for breakfast or lunch and there has been nothing but raves from everyone. They want to come back to visit just so we can go eat at Crackers. Lunch is just as good as breakfast. I've never been disappointed. Service is very good as well. Highly recommend this place.
0,"I have been here three times and it's only been ok for both food and beers. Service has always been decent until today and I won't be back. I always visit three times before writing a review because I feel it's a more accurate and fair to the establishment. Today they officially lost me as a customer. I walk in and sit at the bar. There is a waitress speaking to a couple that was eating at the bar and a male bartender that was also part of the conversation. I wait because, hey they can't just leave a customer they are talking to because that would be rude. Seriously it would. However, behind the male bartender engaged in conversation is a female blond bartender texting that could have easily turned around to take my order. I waited a couple minutes and the male bartender didn't even acknowledge me. Not a glance, look, or \""be right with you sir.\""  The blonde never stopped texting. I walked out and will never go back, there's too many places to eat in this town that don't ignore you and appreciate your business. Also seriously blond bartender? Texting and ignoring a customer? Inexcusable. More inexcusable is the manager that's letting happen in the first place."
1,"LuV LuV LuV - This sushi bar! \nI usually don't get to sit at a bar and eat sushi since i've always got the baby with me. But when I get the chance to sit at the bar, \"" TONY\"" tears it up!!! \nI tell him! \"" I'm a Hungry Beast\"" and he says \"" no Problem, you little CockaRoach\"" j.k. \nHe says, \"" I got you! I give you the goods tonight!\"" Since I love ALL sushi Nigiri Style hands down I trust tony gonna give me the goods...And he delivers with a BANG!\nSo, I recommend sitting at the bar if you get a chance. \nWhy do I love the sushi here, well not only is it very fresh but it also has a Quality that is hard to find here in the city. I also like the portion to rice ratio because sometimes they give you more rice than fish and I really do not appreciate that. \nI also like the side items! The Pork Belly is a delicacy here that I will never not have! Also the Spicy Tuna Cracker Rice is good! \nmmmm... It's all good and I am just dreaming about all my favorite sushi here!!\nI like Mango for desert so they actually had a really nice Mango Mousse this last time that I went. I also like to look at there daily specials to make sure i'm taking advantage of the All You Can Eat!!!"
0,"never have i ever had such a bad experience at a starbucks as i have at this one. i was a partner at starbucks for 5 years. i expect the same values and customer service from every location as i gave in the time i was with the company. \nsadly that is not the case with this location. \ni live right up the street and my wife and i still enjoy grabbing a venti iced coffee with 2 pumps white mocha and a little bit of soy creamer. it never fails when we show up at this location, that my drink is completley wrong. to top it off the partners there dont seem to care. it makes me sad that this is the case. i would not ever reccomend going to this location. its just another 2 minite drive north to farm and durango to get a better experience."
0,Dump. Outdated and run down. However the staff is friendly. The restaurant is so so. And the free wifi is so slow it won't work. You can easily do better else where. Two stars for the staff only.
1,The burger was great! I got one with duck topping and it really popped! Stick with the sweet potato fries over any other type though.
1,"I have eaten here on a few occasions in the past. For lunch, before going out at night, and after an evening of drinking... it suits all occasions! You can just pick it up and leave, or sit on the few tables and seats available inside. Cheap eat, succulent burgers, and on rare occasions their grilled potatoes can be disappointing but on most days, they're good!"
0,"So after not dining here in a couple months, I decided to give it another chance and took my sister for sushi. \n\nSuch a horrible idea, complete waste of money. \n\nWe ordered 5 rolls between us. The vegas roll (which is usually pretty good) was soggy, the lisa lisa roll was much too sweet, one of the other rolls was fishy and all of them were falling apart. They put everything on one plate, so half the rolls were covered in the sweet sauces from the lisa lisa, it did not mesh well at all.\n\nIt also took a good 25 minutes to get our sushi, when there were only 2 other parties in the whole place. \n\nOn the up side, we actually got a waiter who wasn't absolutely horrible. He wasn't good enough to make up for the meal though."
1,"This is the best place for anything for your pets. I've been coming here for years and won't go anywhere else. Joan, the owner is incredible, my Pug Bruno had been having non stop ear infections, and she suggested this great ear cleaner, and it's better than any stuff you get from the vet. My moms dog is terrified of thunderstorms and Joan suggested a thunder shirt, and now Buddy barely suffers like he used to. My Shar-Pei had bad ski lesions on his legs and Joan suggested a different food, and he is all better. I get treats for my pups, all of their food, a lifejacket for my Pug Bruno who's picture is proudly displayed in the store. Joan always has fun parties here with a great photographer throughout the year. A special mention to her 2 adorable Labs, Torque and Priceless, who can be found sometimes working here, and are the sweetest Labs in town! Go see Joan, she is the best!!!!"
0,"I an a mother of a 2yr old. and i make my daughter learn at an early age that education is IMPORTANT. i use to attend toddler time at the WINDMILL location and they are amazing. i attended library time for my toddler at this location and it was terrible. They provide service for toddlers, a time for learning. and those who are parents should understand the importance of educating your children the right way. this place was not structured for a place to learn. the \""story time\"" teacher was terrible. NOT A PLACE TO BRING KIDS TO LEARN AND TEACH BEHAVIOR SKILLS"
0,"Yes, its a beautiful, architectually designed hotel that is so over the top that you have to use a damn remote control to close the curtains.\nThe SIMPLE things and ammenties do not exisit! I stayed in the Sky Suite. The room itself was clean, the bed was very comfy, but when it came to just basic stuff, it just pissed me off. I wanted to listen to music on an ipod or a radio. Not happening, you have to press 20 buttons on the remote and still no chance you will get what you want. They wanted to make it \""green\"" apparently, but I wasn't diggin on it.  \n\n I ate at a Cafe there, don't remember the name, but the service was excellent, food was cooked to perfection and yes it was pricey but expected. \n\nDefinitly get your car valet parked.\n\nThe entrance and getting to your room is NOT convenient at all. You have to walk 6-7 minutes just from the strip to get to the entrance of the hotel, then another 10 minutes walking thru the casino with your suitcase and crap to get to your room which the elevators are located in the back! It sucks!! Of course, they have it laid out that way on purpose, to get you suckered in to throwing some $ down on the slots, etc. But , its a pain in the ass to haul everything, especially on your last day, when all you want is OUT of there."
0,"Oh how I hate this place. \n yes this is a bad review. I'm sorry. I don't like to do this, but i felt that I have to, for the sake of people that actually want to have fun in Vegas. \n   Waiting in line you would think the club was magnifico. It isnt. We are waiting in the promoter line we are about to get in, we ask how much the cover is for the guys. $40. ya no. We tell the boys we'll meet them at Pure or something, the bouncer laughs and tells us Pure is lame, whatever. We get in. We go up the escalator, I'm excited. We walk in, the cool music you hear coming from the escalator goes away and then you realize that crap you hear is what they are playing in the actual club. We think that maybe it was just a bad song choice, we walk in. It's pretty. The chandeliers the dance floor. Its nice. We get on the dance floor, we try to dance to the beyond shitty mix, we start to look around more and we see that there is a huge group of guys standing at the wall just watching the girls dance. It's a little creepy, a little weird, they are really close but not dancing only watching WTH? we shrug it off, turn our backs so we dont have to see them. And we try to dance. We really Tried. The music was so beyond bad. even the paid dancers looked like they were hating it. That is bad. the DJ insisted on playing songs that were so slow. So slow that your like how am i supposed to dance to this. We waited. And waited for even one good song. It never happened. After about 40 min of waiting it out, we leave. Yep. Left. The line is still huge outside the door, they are looking at us like \""why are you leaving\"" we are so happy to get out of there. And then we wonder where to go next. As we decide if we should go to XS or meet the guys at Pure, we see this huge group of girls leave. I mean like 20-30 girls just leave. Trust me they were practically the only girls there, i know that once those girls left the girl line was let in entirely. \n We hated it. I would never go back. The bouncers were assholes, the promoters weren't even nice, the dancers looked hungry and vacant, the DJ sucked. nope. never again."
1,"Best Costco experience. Ever. Seriously, I don't know if it was a fluke, or the time change or what. A typical outing to Costco brings on short tempers, honking horns in the parking lot, and ridiculously crowded aisles as kids grab for every free sample they can. Not here. No horns, plenty of open parking spaces, no crowds for the samples, short lines and actual room at the food court. It was great."
0,Please don't waste your time nor money. I did. The manager seems nice but screws you over. I left work for a 2 hour job and it's been over 4 hours now. And this is my second trip due to the techs not doing their job.
1,"After our last wonderful Mlife spa experience (@ Vdara's ESPA), we decided to try another location (our goal is to try all Mlife spa's at least once.)  We decided to go to Grand Spa since we were staying in the hotel already and did not want to go elsewhere. I called the spa that same day hoping they had something available for us before our dinner reservations we had later that night. The lady that answered the phone was very friendly and was able to accommodate us, we were the last massage appointment for the day. \n\nUnfortunately, we were running a bit late and came 10 minutes after our original appointment. In massage etiquette terms: you're lessening the amount of time you have for your massage.  After checking in and paying we were shown to our separate facilities and given our locker for changing. We changed quickly since we were already late. Our massage therapist met with us and escorted us to the room where we were going to receive our couple's massage. \n\nThe room was very lovely. It was very warm and relaxing. Our therapist were both very wonderful. I do not remember their names, but they were excellent with their technique. The only downside was our massage was less than 50 minutes, but that was due to us being late. After we finished with our massages the therapist left the room for us to change and when we exited the room they had a cold water waiting for us. \n\nAfter our massages my boyfriend and I parted ways to make use of what time we had left to use the spa facilities. Since we were technically the last massage appointment for the day the facility was close to closing soon, but the employees caring for the facility did not try once to push us out. Touring the spa facility I was able to see all they had to offer and for the price you pay for the massage and to use the facility I was expecting a little bit more, especially with the amenities for you to use to get ready. So far, Vdara's spa still has more to offer when it comes that aspect of the spa.\n\nWould I come back? Yes, because who doesn't love being pampered?!!"
1,I've been here at least a dozen times for lunch.  The pizza slices are huge...If I closed my eyes I would think I was back home.  Great crust.  Sandwiches are great and the wings are superb.  This is my go to place when I want to take a pizza home.
1,"Wassup Annie and Regina!\n\nSo about  Mundo... It was good, but not crazy great. I would need to come back to give it a second try. \n\nWell for this try, we had the Queso Flameado which is like cheese fondue served corn tortilla. The cheese combo was really good, along with the other ingredients they put in it. Came with 3 tortillas.  \nThen for entrees we had Carnitas and Seabass. The carnitas was flavorful and sweet, reminded me of coca-cola braised pork. The portion was rather big which was great but again was served with 3 tortillas (note to the restaurant, please give at least 4 tortillas with the apps and entrees) The Seabass was wrapped in parchment and seasoned with spices. Cooked well but not my favorite because I'm not used to the spices. I'm more of a truest with fish - they need to be simply prepared so I can taste the fish.  \n\nFor dessert we had flan and it was really good but I wasn't a fan of the strawberries and fruit syrup with the caramel sauce. \n\nAbout the service, the server was nice but seemed a bit casual compared to the fine dining ambiance. I would have preferred a more professional and informed server. Maybe that's the style of the restaurant but it didn't fit. \n\nAgain, I need to come back and plan to because they have quite a bit of selection of beef entrees that looked good."
1,"deeeeeeeelicious coffee.  lux taught me the difference between good coffee and great coffee, and for this i am eternally grateful.\n\nthis is definitely the best coffeeshop amongst the many that orbit downtown to get some solo work done.  the furniture isn't really set up in a way that's conducive to conversation, and i've never seen strangers meet here.\n\nfor that reason, it's not really a good place to have a work meeting, for example - the tables and couches are almost always occupied enough that you can't gather more than two or three people without being separated.\n\nthis changes when the weather isn't blistering - they have a great patio with more group seating."
0,"Just called in an order to pick up, I had a terrible experience! The hostess was rude, order incomplete, wings cold and undercooked. I asked for Parmesan cheese and red pepper, the hostess I believe her name was Jessica told me no, that she did not have time. I just had to reheat everything! Not a happy customer! And I paid $60, should have done delivery!"
0,Went here for breakfast day 1 arriving in Vegas to sum it up:\nMeh food.\nPretty good breakfast deal. \nSlow and forgetful service.\n\nIf you want more detail read on.\n\nWe were drawn to the restaurant by the promise of a good breakfast deal which is what we got. The food was cheap and just general diner breakfast food nothing very special but nothing objectionable. The worst part was the service. Service was super slow and took very long to come take our order or get refills on our drinks. Keep in mind this was at like 10 AM and the restaurant was near empty. The waitress had to be reminded multiple times to bring sugar/cream to the table. I am sure this place makes decent enough food but the wait times to just get a simple breakfast and get out were too long for any rational person to bear.
0,Customer Service lacking! Cleanliness Null & Void!!!
1,"The guys at Tenaya Creek are real passionate about what they do and it shows.\n\nI had the opportunity to take tour of brewery courtesy of the UNLV Beverage Club a few weeks ago. We got a chance to go behind the scene and see how the beer is actually made. Tour gives one a chance to see just how painstaking and complicated it is to make  brew the beers this microbrewery serves up. Its good to see the owners drinking their own product cause it tells you that the beer is good. The tour allows you to sample 3 of their most popular beers: the pilsner, the hefeweizen, and the IPA.\n\nThe hefe was nice and light, with a great wheat taste. The IPA though not my favorite had high alch content and a good hoppy flavor to it. The pilsner was a good intermediate.\n\nKeep in the mind that this place is a straight up brewery. They do not serve food - just their own craft beer. To me this this really the only downside - if your hungry you will have to look else where, but the beer is the real reason you should be checking this place out anyways. In the back room they have a few arcade games (typical bar fare) and a pool table for those interested. \n\nThis place is a must for anyone looking for true craft beer!"
1,"Firebirds is one of our go-to restaurants for a \""Mommy minus kids\"" night out with girlfriends!  \n\nThe servers are always knowledgeable and courteous!  If you ask for any suggestions or what new menu items are like, they're always right on.  \n\nOne of my favorite items to order is the Lobster Queso for starters!  It's yummy...nuff said.  I also always get the BLT salad with my meals, it's one of the best!  Bread is always fresh and yummy!!\n\nI usually order the Prime Rib dinner and it's always cooked to perfection!  I have also tried their burgers and many of their sandwiches and they are always good too!\n\nThe most favorite thing I love about Firebirds now is that you could make reservations online!!  I always avoided Firebirds on weekend nights because I knew there would be at least a 90 minute wait (if not longer) before we were seated!  Now that's fixed and it's always my first pick when asked \""Where should we go?\""!"
1,"A great steakhouse in a great location. The food and ambiance are top notch at Dominicks. Their ambiance and decor are unlike any other upscale steakhouse around. Being in the Scottsdale Quarter is also a plus for after dinner hang outs.  \n\nFrom time to time, the service does lack the quality and attention to detail expected from such a restaurant and the steaks are not always prepared the way they should be. The consistency is not quite there when compared to a rival like City Hall. \n\nRegardless, Dominick's is a great place to be! Cant go wrong."
0,"I'm a little hesitant to write such a poor review of a new business but I feel the need to let others know about the experience my friend and I encountered at this so called 'salon' , especially since I saw another deal posted online today.\n\nA friend and I purchased a deal for the severely discounted mani/pedi service through Google Deals and should have been wary of such a good deal. I believe it is just the one lady and scheduling the appointment took several phone calls and texts and weird conversations with a so call business partner.  I finally received a call back and after some discussion about accommodating my friend and I at the same time, it was decided that she could bring in a 'friend' and get us done at the same time so one didn't have to wait.\n\nAs Shar B stated, this is not in a salon but a rather small room within a building complex with limited space.  There are two tables and a small love seat where they perform the pedicures.  There is a limited amount of colors to pick from since as she stated, she was just starting out. Fair enough. The manicure turned out okay but I think she talked more than actually worked on my nails and my cuticles were barely trimmed. One of the main reasons I go for a manicure. At one point, she started to look for a tool and realized she had left it in her purse from an event the night before and went to retrieve it. I was shocked as she then started to use the tool on me! The other alarming part of all of this is, the two women talked in depth about the cleanliness of other salons and about how dirty they were and what kind of infections you could get. I'm no sanitization expert but I'm pretty sure pulling a tool out of your purse is NOT sanitized. We moved on to the pedicure and it was just as bad. My feet were placed in a bowl of water that had been brought in from another room since there is no running water in the room. I believe some hand soap was added to the water just before I put my feet in. Fancy.  At one point she even forgot to put a second coat of polish on my big toe.\n\nAnother thing I would like to mention was the conversation. We were told at length about how little they were making on the deal and she had hoped people would tip on the real value of $92 rather than the deal price. Yikes, now she's expecting $15-20 tip. In addition, we got to listen to some other stories that made both my friend and I raise a few eyebrows. \n\nOverall, it was a very odd, alarming, unprofessional and uncomfortable experience for close to two hours. I felt like my friend and I could have done a better job at home doing it ourselves...for free. At several times during the service I thought about just getting up and walking out. I don't like giving such a poor review of someone just starting their business but this 'business' needs some serious help. I would NEVER go back based on the service performed. Had I gotten this deal through Groupon, I would have requested a refund immediately from Groupon. Sorry."
0,"I honestly can't understand how I received such bad service from a hotel that receives 4 stars. \n\nI first want to explain my circumstance as to why I'm even writing this review. I originally stayed at the Venetian in April for a random trip with the girls. After a long weekend, both my friend and I notice that we had money taken from our wallets. She was missing a 50 dollar bill and I was missing 45 out of my own wallet. Now yes, normally any one can say \""oh you were drunk you probably misplaced it\"" but as an avid Vegas goer - I can clearly state that this was my weakest trip I had been on. No drunken stupors were had this weekend. When I had called the security to make the report, not only did i have to talk to several guest services employees but I also had to wait in my room on a Sunday for them to come. When the security guard arrived, he plainly stated to me that no employee of the hotel would have taken it. (First instance of blame the guest). I was promised a call back within 48 hours about their findings. In the end, the check out time took 4 hours. Did I receive a call within 48 hours? No I did not. I then had to take more time out of my day to contact guest services. Luckily I got a hold of Marcus, who by the way was the nicest man, and he could not provide me a report on what may have happened with my missing monies. He then provided me a complimentary upgrade and 1 free night at the Palazzo. I agreed and left the headache right there. \n\nSeveral months go by and my sister offers to take me back to Vegas for a graduation trip. To help save money on the room and spend more gambling, I decided to use my certificate for a free night. I called in once and spoke with Theresa in Guest Services and inquired about rates and fees and she indicated to me that it would be best to call back and book with payment so that I can lock in the rates. I waited until payday and called back and booked. All credit card info was provided. Done. \n\nI get to Vegas this past Friday (9/27) and they advised me that the room went unpaid and that I owed a balance. Now mind you, I had harassed all my friends for payment. Why would I do that if I was properly told that I could pay when I got there? None of that was mentioned during the 2nd phone call when I provided my CC information. By that point I was upset bc not only was I misinformed but no one could understand why I would be upset and they continued to state that their employees would have told us the proper info (Second instance of placing the blame). Seeing how irate I was, they offered a 25.00 restaurant credit (whoopee). I ended up having to clear out my savings to cover the price of the night. They had advised me to call the guest services manager if I wanted to further complain. I advised them to contact me directly bc I wasn't going to wait in the room for a call when my trip was already off to a bad start. \n\nI get into our room and the guest services representative Theresa calls me back only to state that I was wrong. (Third instance of blaming) and that I never discussed pricing with her or booking. Why else would I be calling? For fun? (Fourth instance of blaming). I plainly asked her if she was telling me that as a customer, I was wrong and it wasn't her fault. By this point, I didn't want a resolution I wanted to explain why I was unhappy - what I didn't want was to be blamed AGAIN. I hung up and my friend called back bc by that point I was so frustrated I ended up taking back shots to calm myself. She spoke with Theresa manager who said nothing Theresa had said was wrong. (Fifth instance of blame on the customer). We eventually got no where. \n\nPlease keep in mind - at no point was I reaching for more free loot. I was simply trying to explain why I was upset to someone who would listen. \n\nI have stayed at the Venetian/Palazzo several time before I was mistreated without issues. Now - I will never stay there again. \n\nThey have no respect for their customers. They will blame you to cover their own behind. And to get any assistance, it's like pulling teeth. \n\nSo if you want to pay big bucks for a pretty place with a comfy bed and you dont care about the service, then Venetain Palazzo is your best bet."
0,Salty to the point you can't taste anything else. Dead on a Saturday @ 6:30-we should have known. The waitress showed her face 2 times total & had someone else do all the rest of her work. Appetizers came out well after our actual food. Bad service- horrible food.
0,Had a party for my Wife's birthday and called for the hibachi side. We had 19 people which required three tables. The restaurant called my house and asked me wife how many people would be coming. This was a surprise party for her. Than we got to the restaurant and we only had two tables because they only scheduled two chiefs. Some of our party had to be seated at tables away from us. I liked this place until this. Never go back.
0,"So they put craisins in their guacamole, that doesn't justify the price.  If you are going here for a meal for two with drinks, appetizers, and dessert, It's going to be expensive and not worth it."
1,"I've had accounts with four different UPS Stores over the years and this one is as good as it gets. The staff is AMAZING and really excel at customer service and making you feel like one of the family. Eric is about the friendliest, best employee you could hope for. I'd highly recommend them."
1,"the concierge of the Hilton proposed to go there. Since it was just around the corner we followed his proposal. \nThe first impression was a high price steak house. After a short time we got our table.\nSecond impression: high class, moderate prices, and exellent food quality. Also the waitresses were very observing.\nWe came back the next day already!!!"
0,Roaches in the bathroom.  Dirty and cluttered.  Saw that they were on dirty dining after we ate there.  YUCK!
1,"Great venue for an event like a wedding!  My manager got hitched here last month, and I was impressed with the courtyard where she had the ceremony.  Yes it was outside, and started at 530pm, so it was a little warm, sitting under the trees, we were bothered by a few bee's, probably attracted to all the sweet smells of our perfume.  \n\nBecause the courtyard was surrounded on all sides by buildings, we didn't get the benefit of a breeze and even though we could hear a little  of the street noise, it wasn't too bad.  \n\nThe reception was moved inside to the gym/auditorium which was huge! There is a stage, great place for the DJ, and a large enough space for dancing.  Overall, a historic piece of Las Vegas, that turns out to be a great place for a party!"
1,"Overall, this was a pleasant place. I enjoyed the gourmet offerings in terms of sandwiches, although the price was a bit off-putting ($8-$9 for a sandwich). My girlfriend and I ended up going with the ham and cheese sandwich on pretzel bread. I loved the bread, and the creaminess of the cheeses with the ham. The sandwiches were very large, which explains the price. Also, there was a lot of meat in each sandwich, which is either a positive or negative thing, depending on your preference. In retrospect, we could have split a single sandwich and been very satisfied.  For dessert, I got a pb&j brioche, while the girlfriend got some coffee cake. Both were pleasant, but not as amazing as we would have expected. My brioche was a bit dry, and the coffee cake was just average. The coffee selection, however, was well above average. I really really really love Colorado River Coffee Roasters, and they proudly brew their roasts. If you have not tried a cup, this is a great opportunity. It is best to drink without any cream or sugar, as it has a rich, smooth, sweet taste, naturally. However, their cream and sugar bar was more than accommodating, with many natural sweetening options, as well as free jam and toast. I have a special place in my heart for restaurants that go out of their way to have good coffee."
0,"Gave them a try 10/22/12. Best of luck to a beginner's stab at a restaurant. I doubt they will be around long:\nObservations:\n1. Main entrance is not used, everyone who came in after us could not find the door. I actually had to point the direction for at least six customers who stood at the locked doors.\n2. \""Market Price\"" board at entry is small, dark, and unreadable.\n3. Spartan surrounding devoid of any decor\n4. Music; radio station blaring loudly and preventing normal conversation.\n5. Service staff, though eager, are ill prepared and trained.\nFood:\n1. Calamari appetizer, typical batter fried rings served with as much lemon wedges as product. A small basket for $9.00...\n2. Shrimp Po-Boy, shrimp was adequate but no better than frozen batter fried from the grocery. $13.99...\n3. Parmesan garlic fries, add $1 for standard out of the bag potatoes coated liberally in garlic with a touch of Parmesan cheese. Side order of same is $4.99.\n4. Ice tea and soda, $2.50 a glass.\n5. Whole Tilapia battered and fried (overly fried) served with large serving of plain white rice and a small cup of Coleslaw, $15.99.\nCondiments:\n1. Nothing is offered or provided. Sweetener, salt, pepper, soy sauce, ketchup, eating utensils (plastic), etc., must be requested.\nMaybe it was a bad night but the prices remain out of line for the quality and dining experience."
1,"My last trip to Vegas is a little hazy..,. but I do remember our dinner at Bouchon. I'll spare you all the details and hit some of my high-lites. \n\n1. The bread. They tell you not to eat a lot of the bread. You'll want to they say, but don't. The rest of the food is so good, you don't want to fill up on bread... I didn't listen. The bread was AMAZING. \n\n2. Rillettes aux Deux Saumons. This appetizer alone is worth going to Bouchon for. It was a recommendation of our waiter and it was incredible. It you go to Bouchon and you like salmon even a little, you HAVE to get this! \n\nThe rest of our dinner was very good and the service was excellent. Our waiter (I forget his name) was one of the best I've every had. His wine and food recommendations were right on!"
1,"Harry O was great to work with!  I'm based in IL and booked him for a work event in Las Vegas.  You can trust him - he's professional, responsive and a great DJ."
0,"First impressions are everything...and ours was not favorable. Menu board in the entrance was odd and confusing.  Person who finally helped  us figure it out was a welcome sight.  Food arrived relatively quickly, but was barely warm.  Best item was the black beans.  Floors were sticky, and two out of the three women's bathroom stalls were out of order (not good at 5 pm on a Friday evening).  We are not likely to return anytime soon."
1,"I really like the food at this place. I go there all the time, but the service is poor. And I hate to say it but, while they will help you (after asking them for something 3 times before they do it), unless you're Asian, don't expect to be waited on promptly. \n\nTheir food is amazing and the Salt & Pepper Calamari is the BOMB!"
1,"FINALLY!  I had the opportunity to check out DW Bistro :)  I've heard so many amazing things about this place and wanted to check it out.  The location is pretty far from my house, so this was special.  On my MLK weekend, thought this would be the perfect opportunity for a great brunch joint.  \n\nWalking up to the restaurant, I noticed that it was centered in a really nice strip mall.  Far location, however, seemed super worth it!  The restaurant is super modern.  Clean colors makes for a very trendy location :)  I feel so dirty walking into a white place LOL.  One of the major focal points of the restaurant is the bar.  Super nice.  The bathrooms were clean and made me feel like I was at a spa retreat.  Our server was super nice.  He was helpful.  I wish he told us his name so I could give a shout out, but oh well.  \n\nWe started out with bottomless mimosas for $20.  Trust me, that's the best deal ever.  And bottomless...they NEVER let it go dry.  Always coming around and refilling the glasses.  It was super worth it.  For brunch, I got one of the staff picks, the Jerk Frid Chicken and waffles for $15.  Huge pieces of chicken breasts, fried in a jerk spice seasoning, on top of waffles and served with DW Bistro signature maple syrup.  The chicken was spicy and savory, garnished with a little orange peel shavings.  It was packed with flavor and so delicious.  The waffles were big, yet super fluffy.  The syrup was refreshing and unlike any other syrup I've had.  It went well with both the waffles and chicken.  Such and amazing and well thought out meal.  Definitely a take home item, unless you come with a super big appetite.  I HIGHLY RECOMMEND this dish!!\n\nLooking for a great brunch joint?  Try DW!  It has quickly became one of my top picks in the city.  It's worth the drive.  It's modern, it's trendy, it's awesome!  Thanks for a great morning, DW!!"
1,"Let me set the scene... It a Saturday morning, the second day of spring, there is a blizzard outside, and of all weekends... we choose this one to have a girls only romp in Montreal.\nBut we are troopers... and did I mention hungry? \n\nWe find a restaurant that catches our attention 11 minutes from where we are staying and begin our trek in the snow storm. Wet and cold we arrive and are blown away by the gem we found. Quaint and sophisticated, Universel is not your boring breakfast spot. House music plays in the background, MuchVibe on the TVs and the decor is mix of retro chic, and modern. The breakfast menu is HUGE, service is amazing, and the food came out in less than 10 minutes (which is good cause we were starving).\n\nAll in all amazing breakfast vibe.\nI would make this my regular spot if I lived here.\nPrices are a little higher than a Cora's but well worth the price. \n\nIf you find yourself in MTL in a snowstorm and feel your day has been ruined with ever additional flake, this place will warm your belly and your soul."
1,Had great service and food. The calamari app was one of the best I've had. It is worth a visit.
1,"We went here for dinner during Restaurant Week, since we've had great luck with tasting menus in the past.  We also planned for an early dinner, since it was  previously reviewed as a very dark restaurant.  We made reservations at 6PM through opentable.com, but when we got there, they didn't have us down on the list (we only made them about an hour or so beforehand, so this was excusable).  We were still able to be seated, primarily because it was early and the restaurant wasn't crowded.\n\nThe hostess and our waitress were very nice.  She took our drink order pretty quickly once we were seated.  The drink menu was a little disappointing. Everything sounded very...gross isn't the right word...unfruity.  Lots of peppar, various spices, mint.  Not many fruity delicious yummy cocktails like I wanted. I got one called the Neelkantha, and it was alright--hypnotiq, curacao, and chambord--but I probably would get some wine next time, or just drink beforehand.  Their wine list is extensive.\n\nAs I said, we tried the tasting menu, and the dishes were all good.  We both loved our appetizers.  I had the Coriander Coconut Shrimp.  There were two huge shrimp with a mustard-black  pepper glaze, masala acorn squash (a small slice), and a ginger beet puree that was beautifully beet colored and tasted very earthy like beets.  I loved this dish, and felt like a Top Chef judge with the plating and the cerebral list of ingredients.  My husband had the sheekh kabab meatballs with karavali masala, eggplant-poblano chutney, crispy leeks and a mango avocado salad (read: piece each of avocado, mango, and grapefruit).  This was very spicy, but I could still taste the underlying flavors of the dish as well.  Again, presentation was lovely. \n\nThe main course was challenging for my husband, so we had to trade plates.  Originally I had ordered the masala duck leg confit with kundapur spices, seasonal veggies, and pomegranate syrah jus.  But my husband didn't like his very much (he's a meat and potatoes sort of guy), so I gave it up after a bite so he could eat something he would enjoy.  (The guy just had back surgery, I thought I would give him a break.)  So I ended up eating khoya prune kofta with a milk solids dumpling, prune-ginger chili puree, seviyan ka upma, mirchi ka salan sauce. (One was green, the other white.  I didn't know the difference!)  This was good, but unlike anything I had ever eaten before. The \""dumpling\"" was a 4 x 1 brick on the plate that, by itself, tasted like milk! But the prune fried balls were pretty sweet and yummy, and the sauces complimented them well.\n\nFor dessert, we both had the mango gajrela puff.  They took our knives from dinner, and I would have liked to have it, as sawing through the pastry (which was a little wet) with the side of my fork was a bit tough.  The rabdi ice cream that came with it was quite good, though I am somewhat of an Indian food neophyte, so I don't know what exactly that flavor is.  \n\nEven with the tasting menu, we still paid over $100 for dinner, which seemed a bit high. We each had 2 cocktails, so I guess that adds up quickly, but I didn't feel like we had a $100 experience overall.  \n\nLessons learned: \n1.  Come early so you can see the menu\n2. Drink cocktails before and after dinner\n3.  Be prepared to spend some cash, and you won't be disappointed."
0,"Terrible service.  I'm used to bad service at Asian restaurants, but this was ridiculous.\n\nOrder 2 pork chop rice dishes and asked for an egg on top.  They both came out, no egg.  We had to ask twice for egg.  One egg came out . . and we had to wait for the other one.  They also didn't give us a steak knife to cut the pork chop.\n\nI ordered a Hu Tieu in broth with glass noodles.   The noodles were under cooked and the soup wasn't very hot.\n\nOrdered Goi cuon.  Never came out even though we asked 3 times, we just canceled it.\n\nI'm not looking for fancy pants service and charming waiters, just bring us our food.\n\nAlso seems slightly pricey for mediocre food.  We're sticking with the Rio Buffet from now on."
1,"Unbelievable service! These guys took their time getting 3 nails out of my tire, and didn't charge me a dime! Amazing. \nThanks!"
1,"I have been craving for some authentic ramen for awhile now since my favorite ramen house closed,,so after yelping I decided to try this joint,,and OMG! what can I say it hit the spot and so much more!! their broth is perfect and not too creamy/fatty as monta.. It was just the perfect amount of serving and everything is just so good..I think the best part is that its location is so close to my house and now I dont have to go to Chinatown just for ramen..Im so excited for the weather to get cooler so I can have an excuse to eat it everyday!"
1,"I had hard time deciding whether or not I should be reviewing this place because I had far far far too much to drink prior to dinner at this restaurant.... then, of course, I drank some more during dinner.  Ugh.\n\nWhat I do remember though... is that the food was pretty good~!   And it's not some posh-posh expensive place... Yelp tells me that it's $$ restaurant... but it feels like $$$ place.\n\nThank you to my wonderful friend in Las Vegas for picking up the tab on this one!"
1,"O So good!! I usually get the Philly Cheese Steak w/ mushrooms and extra cheese. It is excellent. The atmosphere is Americanized which I love since everything around Central Phoenix caters to the Hispanics first then Americans.  Like I said the food is great, the reason only four stars is because the service sucks (Having to bring the waiter your cup for a refill every time I go there gets a little old) But other than that is definitely  worth a try!!!"
0,"This is my first 1-star review, after roughly 30 reviews.\nAlthough reviews are subjective in nature, I think that Yelp reviews have an air of objectivity, which is why their reputation is what it is. I follow that credo. \nSince I've lived in Las Vegas, for one reason or another (mainly to play penny slots), I've been to practically every major casino in town, at all times of day: 6 AM, 12 PM, 6 PM, and most recently 2 AM.  \nThis is my review of the atmosphere of the Fiesta Rancho casino. I've never stayed in one of their rooms (because I'm a local), I can't remember eating at any of their restaurants, I've never skated on their rink, and I've never gone into any of their nightclubs.\nI'm still scratching my head, regarding reviews written by other locals who live in the NW, yet have stayed in Fiesta rooms (and have checked-in multiple times). Can anyone clear that up for me?\nIn any event, I've not gambled at the Fiesta Rancho more than I have at any other casino.\nHowever, I've personally heard or have been in close proximity to 3 disturbing incidents at this casino, whereas I've not seen 1 at all the other casinos combined.\nWhile playing there, I've heard gun shots coming from the other side of the casino. Many years ago, my car was vandalized in their parking lot. At the time, I didn't pay it a second thought. Last night, a woman's purse was stolen, and the robbers escaped without a security guard in sight. In fact, the woman screamed for a security guard, and one didn't come over for 2 or 3 minutes.\nMaybe this is just a coincidence, but I really don't believe in coincidences.\nLike I said...Even though my own property was vandalized years ago, I continued to play there through last night, so this review is not biased from that event.\nBut, after last night, I'll never play there again. I don't want to worry about potential wrong-doings.\nI'll gamble with money, but I don't wish to gamble with anything more precious.\nSorry."
0,"Be warned if you are thinking of purchasing one of the Living Social deal coupons that came out in today's e-mail, this business is out of business.  They have not been paying their bills, taxes included, and basically trying to scam the system.  Check the City of Peoria court records, they were formally evicted in October and have known they would not be in business to see these coupons used.  I posted something on Facebook about it and they promptly removed it and blocked me - they know what I am saying is true and they want to continue to perpetrate the fraud.\n\nSo if you want to waste your money, go ahead and purchase one but just so you know Living Social has been contacted.  Below is what I posted on FB earlier...\n\n\""Just to set the record straight... when you don't pay your obligations like rent and taxes you give up the right to be in business. Having said the landlord sold the building is not true, get your facts straight and don't mislead the public. You need to pay your bills. And if you are using the Living Social deal to get the money back you have been reported to them as having gone out of business.\"""
1,"Had dinner here to celebrate my new job. Waiter Christopher, knew the menu extremely well. My date is from Seattle and is therefore leery of seafood here. She got the steak and it was amazing. I had the mahi mahi and it was delicious as well. Wine also did not disappoint. Will definitely go back."
1,"I love this gym. It's got a lot of equipment so you're never waiting, and the staff is super friendly. They don't work on commission, so you won't get hassled to sign up for a PT or anything else. You can just go, work out, and go home. It's nice. And they have TV's on their cardio equipment! Bonus!"
0,"Shitty little Chinese places usually have alright food.. not this place.. nothing we tried even tasted good. A real emphasis on shitty! Ordered tofu, sweet and sour chicken and egg rolls as well as house lo mein.. I think it was the oil because everything sort of tasted rancid and was seriously greasy. Also the shrimp in the house lo mein didn't smell very good so I picked it out.. still the greasy noodles didn't sit well with me or my friend. She ended up getting sick right afterward though I was fine. \n\nI am convinced that there is ZERO decent Chinese in Surprise! Perhaps there is another place I should check out?"
1,"This place is like a must visit every time I come to Arizona. I'm assuming the original Nogales Hot Dogs purchased a food truck and uses this location as one of its stops. This place never fails to satisfy me. \n\nThey have this big cooler of three assortments of hot sauces, along with cheese, mushrooms, onions, and chili pepper condiments. The tacos are a fair size, though I had four to myself. The hot dogs aren't Costco sized, but with all the toppings in it made it sufficient. I don't know their hours, but it's always around at night when I swing by."
0,"As some of the other reviewers, I waited until I had given this locally owned place a few chances...2 times for breakfast and once for an early dinner. \nI have to say I did enjoy the breakfasts (pancakes once and farmers omelet the second) The food was very good, but the wait and the service were big strikes. I totally understand the wait for breakfast on a Sunday morning...it is a busy place with folks going to the farmers market nearby. First time we waited 20 minutes. The second time we waited almost 30. We had said we would take inside or outside, but for some reason the hostess heard only the 'outside.' \nWhen we went for early dinner, the place was pretty deserted. We ordered a beer (they have Kiltlifter on tap, which is our fav) and then we waited and waited. After 15 minutes the beer came, and before we could say we wanted to order the server dashed away. We waited another 5 minutes or so, he came back and we ordered the cheeseburgers...medium. 20 minutes later they came out...so well done they were practically dry. Big disappointment. The server we had never came back, didn't ask if we wanted another beer, etc. so when we were through we went up to the hostess and asked for our check. So silly when there were only 3 tables seated this whole time and no one on the patio (too hot) One server should be able to deal with 3 tables!! \nAll three times I went, I felt that the service was below par and the attitude being kinda 'who cares, I'll get around to it when I can.' And no one smiles at this place. \nDarn, I really wanted this to be a local hang-out place for us."
1,"This is my very favorite of all scrapbook stores! They have the best selection, the nicest staff and great vintage items! Be prepared to spend lots of time because there is so much to see! Great classes withfabulous teachers as well."
1,"Sometimes trying to eat healthy without resorting to itty bitty portions or bland food can be a chore. Shabu Shabu Paradise is our go-to spot when we are really hungry, but still want to maintain some level of healthiness. \n\nThe restaurant itself is fairly small, seats around 25 to 30 people. I've never had to wait for a table though. Decor is simple but nice. For those unfamiliar with how shabu works, your food is all served raw and you cook it yourself in a large bowl of broth. \n\nWhen ordering at Shabu Shabu Paradise you really don't have to decide on too much. First you need to decide on your meat (beef, chicken, pork, shrimp, scallops or you can go the vegetarian route) and portion size. And then you select shabu, sukiyaki or both for your cooking style. There are appetizers you can order as well, I like the crab sunomono salad.  \n\nMeals come with a simple salad that has a very tasty dressing. In addition to your meat you get a bowl of rice and a selection of veggies, some tofu and noodles. Here is where it gets awesome: You can have unlimited refills on everything except the meat. Want 4 salads? No problem. Want more veggies? They will give you some. And there is even ice cream included for desert...  \n\nThe thing that makes Shabu Shabu Paradise stand out for me is the service. It is a small place, every time we have gone in the same waitress has been working by herself. No matter how busy they may get, she is always sweet and attentive. She knows that I never eat my tofu and always want more carrots, and she brings out my plate of veggies just the way I like it. I love that personal touch. \n\nIf you are thinking about checking this place out, and I highly recommend you do, try to make it on a Monday night. That is when they have the best specials:\n15% Off  Any Entr\u00e9e (which drink purchase)        \n20% OFF  All Kobe Dinner (which drink purchase)\n30% OFF  All Sake, Wine & Beer"
0,"Like many I wouldn't even think on reviewing a fast food restaurant but on this occasion I have to...if I could give this restaurant a minus two starts it wouldn't be because the food...my girlfriend loves it and I tend to enjoy their chili...is good!!...on August 19 I wanted to enjoy chili for lunch and offer my girlfriend to bring one for her , so on my way home I decided to run by the drive thru as many time I have done...the staff has always been great but to my surprise this time was the very unprofessional manager who was at the window with the other female employee...I normally will ask for extra crackers for our chili and I have never ever before had been refuse by anyone to drop a few more into the bag...this time the very unprofessional manager refuse to give me some extra after telling me that each chili order gets two packages!!..yet my order which was two chili's only had three in the bag..now..either she was having a bad day and for that she shouldn't be either at the restaurant much less the window or she needs to get her attitude check or be retrain in customer service and customer satisfaction..I don't plan to return to that restaurant as long this lady is there...I forgive but don't forget because as she is I am in the customer service and as much as I may be having a bad day I don't feel a customer should take anyone's frustrations and she shouldn't take hers on anyone...maybe that's why the employees aren't happy working there either!!...well hope the red hair girl do something about this she got great commercials.."
0,"I guess my pizza was better than Domino's or Pizza Hut, but I wouldn't likely eat here again, which is unfortunate because it's so close to my office.\n\nMy pizza was made with cheap ingredients and tasted like it. The breading wasn't anything to write home about either.\n\nNot sure where all the 4- and 5-star reviews are coming from... Clearly they're either faked, customers don't know the difference between crap pizza and quality pizza, or they've downgraded their ingredients since then (2 weeks ago in reference to Joey B's 5-star review!). Poor Joey wouldn't know good pizza if it gave him a reach around!\n\nIf you want amazing New York-style pizza in Mesa, go to Venezia's (venezias.com) and if you want the best New York-style pizza in Arizona, go to Joe's (eatatjoesny.com) in Scottsdale."
1,"All I can say is Yay for Beer Tower!\n\nOther than that, the food was okay."
1,"*Happy Hour Review Only*\n\nAs if Vegas visitors weren't SEXED up enough, here comes $1 oysters for your aphrodisiacstic pleasure (so good it deserves a new word)! Every day happy hour from 2:45-6pm features a different oyster on rotation. Been here a few times and every bite has always been deliciously fresh. It comes with creamy horseradish, vinegar-shallot or cocktail sauces for your choosing.\n\nPJ Clarke's also offers $3 beers and 2 for 1 drink specials for their cocktail of the day, but neither is as good of a deal as the oysters. The beer comes in a mug the size of your hand.\n\nBottom line. When you're done shopping, take a seat at the bar (oyster or regular) and order a dozen happy hour oysters. Then turn around and say hi to me, because I'm likely camped out there. Added as a MUST VISIT for my Vegas trips!"
0,"I was pretty disappointed with Steve's Espresso.  Considering its moniker, you'd think the espresso would be good here.  It wasn't.  My espresso was bitter and a touch sour.  It was drinkable, but that's hardly a recommendation.  \n\nI tried one of their breakfast pastries, with cheese, bacon, and egg.  I was even less impressed with that.  I was surprised when the cashier handed it to me and told me I should go microwave it myself in an oven they have by the door.  I was told to put it in for 45 seconds.  I figured they would know their business and trusted what I was told.  After I left I decided to sneak a bite while stopped at a light.  The thing was ice cold in the center.  Great.  A bacon, egg and cheese-icle.  Even the part around the edge that was warm wasn't that great.  The dough tasted like it came out of a tube.  I probably would have been better off with something else.  There were several baked goods in the case that looked amazing.\n\nThe person that helped me seemed really nice, so I kind of feel bad giving the place such a hard review.  Honestly, most people would probably be happy with the drinks here, especially if you're the sort that pumps a bunch of sugary crap into your drink. \n\nAccording to a sign on the door they specialize in French press coffee, so ordering that might be a better bet.  But if that's the case, why doesn't he call the place Steve's French Press Coffee?  Either way, I won't be risking another stop here."
0,"Semi sketch store\nThey have an \""OK\"" selection but not much\nCustomer service is okay too\nNothing much to write about"
0,"This place is the perfect representation of Scottsdale: all appearance and no substance. \n\nThe decor is very nice and the service is good (thanks Renee), but the food is just terrible, terrible, terrible. 100% of everything was bad. Wait, I take that back, the smothered tots were delicious, but about the quality of chef boyardee (if he made smothered tots). \n\nSo my friend and I sat and each ordered multiple burgers (they have a 3 oz portion). Between us we ordered 5 different burgers and each was INEDIBLE. Seriously, we were hungry guys and we like burgers. We couldn't eat this crap. It wasn't just bad it was gross. For example, both of the ground beef burgers we got were still pink on the inside (and for a tiny 3oz patty you really have to try to cook it rare). \n\nThen, to really illustrate how awful this experience was, I picked up two PB&J's and two grilled cheeses for my vegetarian friends back at the office. They couldn't eat them! They were too gross! It was so bad, that out of 7 entree's, not a single one was good enough to eat! \n\nOh yeah, and it wasn't cheap either!"
1,"OMG this place is great. My friends booked their room here and I was privileged to unexpectedly crash on their sofa for a night. What makes it so great?? First off, it's complimentary valet (tip!!). Second, you walk thru the spacious lobby straight to the elevators. No annoying convoluted trek thru a loud smelly casino to get to your room. Third, pseudo double doors suite that made it extra private and sound proof. You couldn't even ring the door bell if it was \""do not disturb\"" status. This might suck if you lost your key and was trying to knock on the door, cuz you wouldn't be able to hear anything. Fourth, the kitchenette (mini fridge, stove range, blender, sink, microwave, coffee maker, 1 plate). Fifth, the bathroom (double sink, crystallized walls separating the toilet and shower, and tub). Sixth, it's right across from Fashion Show Mall. \n\nI would definitely look into booking a room here for my future Vegas trips."
1,I stopped by for the Friday seafood buffet. They have a promotion where once you get 10 points you can swipe your card and the kiosk for 50% off. Pretty good deal!\n\nThe selection was great. They had a raw oyster and clam section. Also had fried oysters and oysters rockefeller. Snow crab legs were available whole and halved. The crab legs were pretty good - not overcooked and very sweet.
1,"My wife and I had dinner at the new Walnut Grill last night.  I usually wait a couple months until the bugs are worked out of any new restaurant, but my friends said the food was great and to give it a try.  We weren't disappointed. The the balsamic and wild mushroom chicken dishes were fantastic.  The table service was excellent.  The only snag was waiting a short time on a reservation.  Again, we eat out regularly and have experienced nightmares going to new restaurants.  This was a minor issue for us since they were extremely busy.  I gave them 5 stars based on what they accomplished in a short period of time.  The food and table service are worth the wait, but make make reservations on weekends to avoid longer waits."
1,"I took my mom with me to Carrabba's to celebrate a new job because it is her favorite restaurant. We were not disappointed.\n\nWhen I started to realize that we had been sitting for a few minutes without seeing a server, a manager walked over, apologized for the delay and took our appetizer and drink order. \n\nWe started with the delicious bread and then had crab cakes, that were oh-so-yummy. The drinks were delicious and the waiters were amusing. The atmosphere is casually Euro-hip and the open kitchen is always bustling with excitement. \n\nWhen my Spiedino Di Mare (shrimp, scallops and asparagus) arrived, I was a bit put off by the look of the plate. For about $20, I received a bland plate with soggy yellowing spears of asparagus, 4 medium sized scallops and 4 pieces of stuffed shrimp. Nevertheless, it smelled GREAT. \n\nI dove into the scallops immediately and they seemed to melt deliciously away on my tongue. The stuffed shrimp were had the same basic components - breaded and grilled with a generous lemon butter sauce to swim in.\n\nThe manager came over to check on us and I decided the asparagus wasn't too foul of a move since everything else was pleasant, so I didn't tell him. I'm surprised he didn't ask why I hadn't eaten any of the pitiful looking vegetable on the plate, however.\n\nThat being said, I love Carrabba's and will definitely be back!"
1,"In meiner Jugend, Anfang der 80er, gab es in meiner Heimatstadt ein gro\u00dfes Einkaufszentrum mit Freizeitbereich im Keller. Die ganze Clique hat sich dort Tag f\u00fcr Tag eingefunden und fast das komplette Taschengeld in die dort aufgestellten Automaten geworfen. Retrogames bietet genau diese Atmosph\u00e4re die damals erlebt habe und l\u00e4sst mich in Nostalgie schwelgen. Daher ist ein Besuch jedem zu empfehlen, der sich einmal mit der Geschichte der Arcadegames befassen will. Denn gerade die Tatsache, das hier Ausprobieren ausdr\u00fccklich erw\u00fcnscht gilt, macht es besonders reizvoll.. :-) Seit diesen Tagen sind Computerspiele immer ein Teil meines Lebens geblieben.

Mit den Kollegen von damals stehe ich noch heute in Kontakt und wir treffen uns trotz aller Distanz regelm\u00e4\u00dfig in meiner alten Heimatstadt. Vor kurzem kam die Idee auf, wir k\u00f6nnten uns ja auch mal in KA treffen und dann gemeinsam zu Retrogames zu gehen. Am 3.

1,"Chipotle Philly is superb, club supreme is great, Italian is very good. Make sure to arrive closer to 11:30 if you plan on walking in, at 11:45-ish the place is packed, although service is quick and efficient. Definitely recommend over the local hotel restaurants."
1,"We stopped in for dessert only.  We arrived right at 4:00pm, opening, and were greeted with a very friendly smile and seated quickly.  Jeremy was our server and he was great! \n\nWe had the Chocolate Turtle Flambe.  Of course the kids loved the fondue forks and were amazed at the chocolate on fire!  Then all the fantastic tastes on the dessert plate, strawberries, cheesecake, marshmallows, bananas, pound cake and brownies.  They didn't stand a chance!  Jeremy brought us out extra bananas, pound cake and marshmallows.\n\nWe had a great time and will return for a full meal, or just dessert again."
1,"Excellent stay for one night. Everyone we came across was very helpful and friendly!! The room was clean and well maintained. We had used a deal via living social and it worked beautiful, no problems at all. Would definitely stay here again."
0,"This place is just not that good, I don't know, just saying. The staff was pretty rude and sarcastic, they constantly were asking for our order when I was clearly visually upset and not ready, was having a bad day is all, still I felt rushed. The brat was average, fries were pretty good, but I wouldn't care to have them again. I liked that they had RC and various sodas. Also there's no parking and dumb people block the path out and street by taking pictures, so plan accordingly. ; )"
1,"This place has the best Chinese food in our area! I'm not a big Chinese food fan, but I really enjoyed the food and will be coming back again! The fried rice is amazing!"
1,This is just a gem in Chinatown. The chef and entire staff are very nice. The food is excellent! I will be back again.
0,"Well, we were trying to find \""cheese dip\"" in Vegas.  Some kind of Tex-Mex.  We found it.  Let me tell you, that was the best thing about this place.  The cheese dip was actually pretty good and a very ample serving.  Chips were thin, crispy and not too salty.  We really liked it until the entrees came.  Ugh!!  Pork tamales tasted like they dropped the salt shaker in them.  Pork taco was cold and pretty light on the meat.  The cheese enchiladas were, um, cheesy.  That's about it.  Not much taste at all.  Refried beans were smoky and not horrible.  But the rice, was the worst Mexican/Spanish rice I have ever put in my mouth.  Terrible!!  The only reason this place doesn't get one star is because our server, Boone, was awesome.  It's not his fault the food stank.  I would not go there again, unless I was just wanting cheese dip and no entrees.  If you're looking for Mexican OR Tex-Mex, you can do a LOT better."
0,"This was one of my weekly stops for lunch during the work week.  My standard order would be the wedge with the Thai steak.  The portion use to be huge, the tomatoes were blood red.  Now when I go in I get half the food the tomatoes are so poor they get shifted to the side.  Did they cut the price by half, NOPE.  Eating at 131 is a premium over other restaurants which I don't mind when I get what I pay for.  I have also been pretty disappointed in the amount of time it takes to get the food to the table.  Wonderful atmosphere, but honestly that is where it stops.  Save your money."
1,"I have eaten here dozens of times. Only once was the food ever bad and they made it right in a hurry. Service is always excellent and this is really the only place I go for Italian food. I've eaten at a few of the other locations but this one is my favorite. I generally don't review big chains, but I'm happy to make an exception for Carrabbas."
0,"I didn't think this place lived up to what it's known for.... BURGERS!\n\nIt was suppose to be this great place to have burgers, we get there to find only three burgers on the menu... kind of a let down. And they weren't anything special. Not to mention it was very dark inside. The only cool thing about it was that the fries came in this tiny grocery cart shaped baskets..."
1,Good hospital. Trauma teams are excellent. There's a reason they filmed a Trauma:Life in the E.R. here. All the nurses on pretty much all the floors are all good. Quite a few gorgeous ones too. Just saying.
1,"Great place to go for lunch. Be sure to sit in the bar area for happy hour if you are dining between 3pm and 7pm or 9pm to closing. We didn't know this the first few times and could've saved on our appetizers. They have plenty of booths in this area as well, if you are like me and prefer a booth. \n\nThe blackened Mahi Mahi sandwich is bomb! If you've never been here or tried it, I definitely recommend ordering this sandwich. I literally order this with a side of garlic fries every single time I come here (and have my boyfriend order a new entree to try out haha). The presentation seems to always change and I have to admit the last one I got was a tad saltier than normal, but nevertheless it was still really good. \n\nThe Cajun pasta is flavorful and has a good amount of meat. \n\nThe Woodford Reserve bourbon salmon is also tasty. I prefer the sweet glaze on the side, though. \n\nThe calamari is lightly breaded and fried, which is nice. I like to dip mine in salt, pepper, and lemon juice. \n\nThe blue crab and artichoke dip is a good appetizer. I really like the crostinis they serve along side it. The only negative is that there isn't much crab in the dip. \n\nAlso try their sampler flight of beers! You can get six samplers for just over six dollars."
0,"Atmosphere is kind of awesome...cool bikes inside, neat decorations.  Waitstaff was rude.  Cute but rude.  Way understaffed also.  1 hour wait for food on a slow saturday afternoon.  \nHas potential, but maybe the count should stick to building wicked chops and hot rods.."
1,"Great new local Italian spot in the neighborhood. We really enjoyed our dinner and the place looks great! We are giving them a -1 star for the service which was good but pretty slow. It's only their second day being open so I'm sure it will get better. Anyhow, the food and drinks were great. We shared the grilled octopus, the caprese 3 way, and the bolognese and finished with the chocolate dessert. Very yummy and we will be back!"
0,"This place just doesn't get it... Service is very slow most of the time, even for pick ups. Tonight I ordered two halo halo w extra ice cream and flan... All together costs me $19... Overpriced everything. Picked it up and what do I get? Small scoops of ice cream and half an inch of flan. I was so annoyed I had to call them back but got nothing. I will never ever ever come back here again... To think they are right down the street from where I live. Don't waste your time, money and patience with this place. Piss poor service."
1,Rick is the best.  I live in Denver and fly out every few weeks for perfect highlights.  And the prices are fab to boot!
0,"Molly M.\nManager\nBlock & Report Owner\n\n3 days ago\nHi Larry,\n\nI believe we've fixed the situation with the pricing...our menu artist has been ill and in the hospital.  We've had to scramble to fix his unfinished work.  \n\nOur sincere apologies - and our gratitude for the compliments\n\nBest regards,\nMolly Callihan-Moss\n\nLarry L. 3 days ago\nGreat. He must be REALLY sick because the same thing happened months before with the drive thru menu.

Yesterday\nIt's not that hard. Take a damp paper towel and erase the wrong prices. Let dry. Write in the correct price with colored chalk. Hope I've helped with your issue   Not a big deal for me but, most don't like being overcharged. Oh wait, they actually weren't  overcharged right?"
1,"While visiting St. Andrews Cathedral and Castle, hubby and I wanted a simple quick hot lunch (50s in June is still cold for Americans). Zest served that exact purpose. We ordered at the counter and was informed when the food was ready. Our lunch consisted of lentil soup and sandwiches. My curry sandwich was especially yummy without the overpowering taste of the curry spice. The big windows brought a lot of light into the restaurant which is somehow the perfect setting for a light lunch. \nI noticed the sign said Zest juicing & coffee bar, sadly I didn't have room left for any juice, but if you are visiting Zest, at least you know that option is available for you."
0,"Went to Guedos for the first time today and was really disappointed.  The food was terribly over priced and all normal sides are ala carte to your entree.  Rice and beans are an expensive add-on and are  served in styrofoam dishes.  You have to pay extra for chips and salsa as well.  I spent $20 for a meal that would have been no more than $11 at a  better quality restaurant.  The burro I had was fairly bland and tasteless, the beans were alright but nothing special and the rice not good at all.  I would have enjoyed taco bell much more at 1/3rd the price.  Glad some like this place.  The owner seems like a nice guy, but Imho, the prices and food quality are a deal breaker."
0,"I'm a huge fan of White House Black Market. Matter of fact I have been shopping at this store since they first moved into the valley and only had one store in the arrowhead area. It has been a delight watching this store throughout the years as they have grown and their designs continue to stay classy. \n\nI've only had maybe a handful of experiences at the Scottsdale Fashion Square location. Even though I shop at this mall weekly my preference has been the Biltmore location due to the level of customer service. Sadly I have to rate this store with only two stars. I have to say usually I am always greeted when I first walk in. However, this time I was not. All the staff was at the register or in the dressing room area. It was a busy Saturday afternoon around 1:30pm so there was heavy traffic. The store was very well stock and in order. Plenty of beautiful options to choose from with clothes, jewelry and accessories. This time I was on a mission and new specifically what I wanted. The item I purchase every year that sells out fast with limited stock since it goes fast. I walked directly to my items and head to the dressing room still not hearing a peep from anyone. Luckily I noticed the buy one get one 50% off sign or I would be clueless on what the sale was. \n\nAt the dressing room I asked for a room. The lady kindly took my clothing and placed them into the room. She was very busy and did not say a word so I have no idea what here name was. As I tried on my merchandise I asked her to find me additional pieces. I loved the item I came in to purchase and wanted to buy all that was in stock. She said she would look. As I waited and waited and waited with her never returning. I decided to slip out of my room to see if maybe someone placed the dressing room returns back on the shelf. With no luck I went back to the room. The sales lady never returned and was now at the register. I walked up to register one where Andrea rang me up and mentioned the sale. I explained to her that I wanted more and my service at the dressing room. She basically ignored me and asked for my 5% discount card. She was also mutli-tasking as she was helping me since other sales associates were asking her questions. I went ahead made my purchase and she thanked me for coming in. \n\nAs I left the store I realized I left a bag in the dressing as I walked to the dressing room I noticed someone was in the room. I mentioned to the person attending the dressing room that I left something in there. She looked me up and down to say rudely \""The room is empty.\"" No smile and walked away. I realized that someone else found it and placed it at the register. \n\nOverall the store and merchandise are not but the employees are very snooty or welcoming. Not the typical culture of any of their stores that I have shopped locally or out of state. For some reason the employees at this location seem to be very snobbish and brush guest the wrong way. Very disappointing. I am still a fan of White House Black Mart but will not be shopping at this location again."
1,"I've taken my dogs to 3 different boarding places in the last few years.   I was seriously UN-happy with all of them.  Then I found \""Just like Home\"" and that is exactly who I was looking for!  Every other place left the dogs in cages except for a bathroom run 1x or 2x a day.  They sat is cages while other dogs played.  How horrible is that?!  \n\nJust like Home lets them play and be normal.  It's hard enough they are not at home.  But to leave them in cages 24/7 just seems inhumane.  I absolutely LOVED it that both of my puppies slept with their friends on couches or futons just like at home.  They played all day and were exhausted at the end of the day from FUN and not from being traumatized. \n\nHonestly?  This is the ONLY place I will even think about leaving my dogs from now on.  They treat them like their own and have absolutely no problems with the nanny cameras.  I don't know of any other place that has cameras.  Which is very suspicious.  \n\nThe staff was also great with helping explain to my 3 year old daughter that the dogs were just going to doggie school like she did when I go to work.  They also showed her how to open the web cam on my phone (they asked me first of course) so she could see her puppies 24/7.  All I can say is AWESOME place."
1,"As of this morning, this is my new means of a regular workout. Overall, it's a great way to burn calories, get your heart rate up while getting a great view all at once.\n\nAfter being warned by my mother that the northern trail was \""basically rock-climbing\"", I was releaved when I found out that it was nothing that extreme. It's a pretty solid track all the way up until you hit the last stretch. It's called Camelback mountain because it looks like a camel, and the first part you see on the northern trail is what you think is the camel's hump. Wrong. That's just the head. The HUGE, hidden crag that the head covers up from your inital view is the camel's hump. Once you reach that point, you will curse yourself, your mother, and the day you were born for going through with all this and how the mountain tricked you into thinking it would be a cake walk. \n\nThat last stretch before you reach the peak is brutal, so make sure you've got a bunch of water bottles or a camelbak on you as well as something to satiate your stomach. When you've made it to the top, you're treated to what is likely the best view in the city. It's natures way of patting you on the back before she lets you sprain your ankle on steep way back down. Once you've made it back you can add Ben Stiller's quote from Heavyweights as your line for the day: \""Stragglers get left behind... I know I did.\"" You deserve it, so use that line with pride."
1,"I just can't believe this restaurant is rated so poorly!  It is my FAVORITE and I consider myself picky.  I think they have great cocktails and chips and salsa.  I always order the same thing... chili relleno, 2 avocado enchiladas with cream sauce and papas.  Yum!  I could eat here once a week."
1,"The ramen is not cheap as others have said, and 12 dollars does seem like a lot for the simple ingredients.  However, it is tasty, and as someone who craves ramen a lot, its awesome to have a \""healthy\"" ramen option in town to stop me from eating maruchan ramen. That being said, the BUNS are AMAZING.  They are also not cheap, 7 dollars for 2 small ones, but wow they are so good.  You can also get these buns at umami's food cart in library mall, usually there monday-friday.  I highly recommend the pulled pork buns, which have a peach-miso sauce (they say chutney, I say sauce). Will certainly be eating more of these buns in the future, but wouldnt go running back for the ramen (I had the miso chicken ramen), which is ironic because I had originally gone there for the ramen with no intention of trying the buns."
0,"All is not well in the Emerald City of Las Vegas. It seems that the nickel and dime mentality has settled in here leaving guests wondering what other unforeseen charges or overlooked amenities will be discovered.  I DO NOT recommend staying here. My friend and I have had too many unpleasant surprises in just two days. It is a shame really that a  prominent hotel like this has sunk to cheapness and frankly, some dishonesty thrown in. We are here attending a convention and the convention center itself has been wonderful. It is sparkling clean, with great meeting rooms and halls. Our time at the convention is enjoyable without a doubt. But then.....\n\nSomething is incredibly amiss at the hotel. The MGM is undergoing construction and that is part of the problem This is a BIG reason to avoid this place for now. Their website attempts to gloss over this fact. It says that the MGM is getting a \""grand renovation\"" and then proceeds to tell you to check out what is new. Oh how exciting!  However, it isn't the kind of excitement you want; a letter placed on your bed, informing you to expect construction noise as well as the water supply being shut off on certain days. Why are guests paying $200 a night and being checked onto a floor where the water is being shut off? This is truly a first for me. For this incredible inconvenience (which you pay for) you receive a letter thanking you in advance for understanding the difficulties of renovating this hotel. They offer you a 15% discount on a future stay....WHAT!  After checking in and being encouraged to spend an additional $15 per day to experience the \""grand renovation' experience, you get your water shut off and construction noise during the day! When I called guest services to ask for my 15% discount today, I was lectured on how unemployment is a problem and I should be glad that the hotel did not close to renovate. Can it get any more bizarre? Is there a Wizard behind a curtain spinning politically correct excuses in this Emerald City? Is this mega-million dollar corporation so greedy that it cannot absorb a few empty rooms?   How about closing one wing? How about honestly updating future guests on your website like other hotels do that there is construction going on and it may be noisy, and for this inconvenience we are offering a sale?  Is it because there is deeply planted nickel and dime antics going on? The strict mini fridge \""touch it and you own it\"" rule, charging $50 per day if any personal items are found in this fridge(I guess rental fee added to $200?) , $10 fee for $80 ATM withdrawal, lack of in-room coffee maker, and mandatory resort fee of $25 per day, even though the \""resort\"" pools and grounds are closed for the season, are all signs of a grand hotel where the customer comes last. Any good things about my stay? The hotel is clean and the staff is exceptionally pleasant, but one can hardly notice these things when one is staying in a hell of a renovation resort. We have 4 more days here. We will update you on whether the MGM Grand is Grand enough to discount our stay for this inconvenience of renovation,  or instead,  will be passing out complimentary construction hats.  Stay tuned, and stay away!"
1,"One of the best buffets I've ever been to!  I hate to admit this (a sin in my family really..) but I am not the biggest fan of buffets.. I admittedly don't eat that much, and I always feel like I'm torturing my tummy to get my money's worth ): Also, they're a wide selection of food that's usually mediocre at best..  Bacchanal (however you pronounce that), however, definitely changed my mind!  Yes, there were MANY MANY choices, but I honestly did not feel pressured to have to eat everything, because the seafood section was amaaazing!  I cannot tell you how many times I went back for more seafood, especially those fresh oysters. And crab legs. So good. Really the highlight of the buffet I thought.  Their carving station was pretty good too, I enjoyed my ribs a lot. But wow. The seafood.\n\nWarning - the wait can be kind of torturous, but they have this electronic system where you sign up on the machine and they text you when you need to come back and get in line, which is kind of nice so you can walk around and do some shopping or gambling while you're waiting.  The wait IS about an additional 15 minutes after they text you though.  Also, the \""estimated wait time\"" that they show you after you sign up might not be very accurate.. I'm assuming it's because people drop out. Our estimated wait was 90 minutes, but it only took about 20 for them to text me back. So just be prepared for that!"
0,"I can't believe I paid $11 for a regular sized cup of the frozen hot chocolate and it doesn't even contain any alcohol D=  The wait is always long here and honestly, it's overhyped.  I'd rather go to the Sugar Factory.  At least there's a cool area to browse while waiting to be called."
1,"This is the best pizza I have ever had in my life. I've had pizza in NYC (lived there in my youth), Italy, Chicago, you name it, I've hit up the big pizza places.\n\nThis is by far the best pizza I have ever had in my life. I've been vegetarian for over three years and I still dream about their pepperoni pizza and desperately crave it.\n\nA word to the wise. There is no fricken ambiance in this facility. But who the hell asks for ambiance from a pizza joint?\n\nHell, maybe the next time I am in Pittsburgh I will give up giving up meat to eat a pepperoni pie here.\n\nCan you get a better endorsement than that? I think not. Go and enjoy the pizza, save some of your crust to dip in the oil that is left. This isn't a health conscious pizza place, but who eats pizza for their health? Splurge and enjoy!"
1,"My best friend and I went to Koi on our first night in Las Vegas (about 2 years ago). After the complimentary bottle of champagne gifted to us by Planet Hollywood and a gaze at the amazing view of The Strip from our hotel room we decided it was time to get dressed up and go out. We only had to venture down the lift.\n\nI had heard of Koi only as a restaurant frequented by celebrities, and consequently had certain expectations. Koi definitely met them. From the minute we stepped inside we were given some of the best customer service I have ever experienced. The wait staff were welcoming, attentive, knowledgeable and efficient. It definitely felt classy and you were made to feel special.\n\nKoi is a great place for an intimate gathering. The seating is comfortable and spaced out enough for a private conversation. You also don't have to worry about interruptions from nearby patrons because you can't hear them. The ambiance is great, and the lighting just dim enough.\n\nWe tried almost everything we could on the menu. The cocktails, hand rolls, edamame and creme brulee were my favourites. We did rack up a large bill for a sushi restaurant, at least $160. However it was the perfect place for the first night in Vegas and I remember the experience fondly.\n\nUnfortunately there were no celebrity sightings because they make good use of curtained areas and the back door exit. That's okay though, I'm happy for Nicole Richie and others to graze in peace."
0,Came here because it was close to where we live. The food was horrible. My wife and I are avid Indian food lovers. The prices are too high and the quality of food is not up to par. Ordered chicken tikka masala and veggie khurma.  The masala tasted watered down. The khurma had no taste and had strange veggies in it for the dish like green beans. Couldn't call this place authentic. Would not recommend to others. My 2 cents. The search for a good Indian food restaurant continues for my wife and I. This was the first place in Vegas we tried.
1,"Everyone knows that when you go to a comedy club that you don't want to sit in the front row because you are going to get ripped into. Well, at Vinnie's show it doesn't matter where you sit because he will find you.  \n\nWe went to his show in February of 2009 and I have to tell you that we are still talking about it. He is hilarious. He says things that make you so very uncomfortable. I was torn between dreading the moment he saw me and having the anticipation kill me.  \n\nHis show is very definitely worth whatever the charge is. His show alone will make your Vegas vacation special and something you will talk about for years. \n\nTed's review says it all. The CD's you can purchase after the show are great. Now everyone back home can hear all that went on.  \n\nBest show in Vegas by far."
1,"I stayed at the Mirage and didn't want to take a cab nor walk in my high heels to another hotel, soo.... why not just go downstairs to JET. I didn't have to wait in line, my man handed the guy in charge a $20 bill so we can cut through. Ladies are free, guys are half price with pass. If you walk around the casino, I guarantee you will run into someone handing out those discounted passes for the club. This club is always crowded. So I preferred going into the other smaller bar/room and dance there. But a few minutes later, it gets crackin too. Very diverse. There's black, white, asian, mexican, tall, short, fat, skinny, ugly, and good-lookin people that come to this club. I had a little bit too much to drink and wasn't feelin that good since I threw up a couple of times in their bathroom, so I left around 2am. But for the couple hours that I was there, I had fun! I love to dance!!"
1,"I really like this mall. Its outdoors and high tech. From our lunch at CPK I could watch the Lakers/Celtics game on a big screen television situated in the middle. There are a ton of stores to choose from: Best Buy, Target, and all the regular stores you see in a mall like Hot Topic, Victoria's Secret, and Tilly's. My friend told me that at night there are lasers that go across the whole mall which I think is cool. There is a lot to choose from for nourishment options as well. They play music really loud which was kind of annoying. i can see why over the summer it may not be very nice because of the heat but, on a 70 degree day like today, I liked it. Parking was terrible which is why I was glad I didn't drive. I'll probably end up going back for all my shopping needs."
0,"Pei Wei is normally delicious. But for some reason this location messes up our order EVERY TIME. They even messed up our replacement order. The manager (if you can get through to him) is great and takes care of us, but having to call and talk to the manager every time you done out is annoying. Just get it right!"
0,"I wish I could give this store no stars. Stopped in during a girls trip in December of last year to buy my boyfriend a Christmas gift. It was during the day and I was dressed in comfortable clothes (jeans, t-shirt, and Chuck's). The staff didn't say one word to me nor did they even acknowledge my presence in the store, which was obscenely overpriced for the quality. A gentlemen walked in wearing designer clothes and the staff was more than happy to greet and assist him. Apparently, I didn't look like a serious buyer so the staff didn't give me the time of day. I work very hard and can afford to shop at a store like John Varvatos but after my experience in Las Vegas I won't ever step foot into one of his judge mental stores again."
0,"Cashier is rude as fuck. And gross as shit, wiping her nose with her sleeve while I'm ordering. I feel unclean as hell eating this shit right now."
1,"Mmmm...Kiltlifter!\n\nI've been to Four Peaks several times, but gosh dang it, I can't tell you a thing about the food! I know I've eaten there, but honestly, when I think of Four Peaks, I think of beer and nothing else. The Kiltlifter is by far one of the best beers I have ever had the pleasure of chugging. You can get bottled Kiltlifter in stores now, but you gotta try it from the tap at least once. In its freshest state, Kiltlifter is as close to perfect as an amber ale can get.\n\nAnd of course there's food at Four Peaks...I have a vague, fuzzy memory of a pizza with pine nuts. I think it was good...\n\nBTW, I'm a little confused as to why 48 people voted that there was no alcohol at this place...it's a brewery???"
0,"The Good:  A few good beers on tap (potentially good cocktails).  Small menu.  Good Bartender.\n\nThe Bad:  Server who appeared to have never been in customer service before.  She didn't really speak English and when I tried to speak French she acted as though she couldn't understand me.  Didn't check on me after I tasted my food (explain the food below).\n\nThe Ugly:  I was excited that this restaurant came to my neighborhood since Cotes-Des-Neiges is full of awful restaurants.  They had both of my favorite starters, Tuna and Beef Tartare.  The restaurant was new so it was clean so I decided to try them.  The tuna seemed off colored and just didn't taste right so I moved to the steak tartare.  The steak was cut into strips which didn't seem right because that can lead to a chewy experience.  BUT, I thought, if the beef is tender enough I guess it will work.  I took a bite and couldn't swallow it.  The beef tasted 'off' and I had to go to the bathroom to spit it out.  Maybe it was just a really cheap sirloin.\n\nThe End:  After a couple bites of each I asked for a check (in French to the server, who couldn't understand what I was asking for in French or English and so the Bartender asked and understood what I was saying in French).  Not once was I asked what I thought of the food.\n\nRecommendations:  Work on customer service.  Hire professional wait staff that know a lot about customer service.  Use high quality ingredients, charge an extra buck or two if you have to.  These things may seem too expensive at first but if you can get locals coming back then you'll stay in business.  Save $ on these things up front and we'll see what business goes in next in a year or two.\n\nThen again, it IS Cotes-Des-Neiges so maybe there are so many bad places to eat that this place will fool people.\n\nI hope they up there game because there's only 1 good restaurant on Cotes-Des-Neiges at this point.  Unfortunately my stomach is hurting right now so I don't think I'll be back to this place."
1,Brio is a great option if you're at the Quarter looking for Italian. Plenty of outdoor seating in addition to their large dining room inside. I ordered the pasta alla vodka - ricotta filled pasta with a tomato cream sauce. Either my appetite is gigantic or the portions have been average at the Italian restaurants I've been to in the valley because I licked my plate clean. \n\nEntree prices range from $13-20.
1,It was a great experience and an amazing relief after a tiring long walk along the strip...!!! \n\nI defenately would come back to this place next time I visit Vegas ... Had excellent service .
1,"Very fair price and great explanation of what services offered. I felt very comfortable here, and my Girl's dog is doing great!"
0,"I used to work at a day spa and this place is a joke in my opinion. I can't believe how the service was. Just Horrible. I got a gift card from my Mother-in-law for my B-day, she said she loved this place. I guess they mush have hired a completely different staff by the time I got there. My husband and I both got facials by 'Jessie'. Our hour long facials turned into more like half an hour and then she tried to charge us an \""up-grade\"" because she used a mask on my husband... his facial was supposed to come with a mask. Then we both walked out of there covered in the green mask that smelled like dog treats. We had it in our hair, our eye brows and lashes, and down our necks. The only good part was the pedi. She was an actual adult, the first one I saw there the whole time. The worst part was the 18 year old behind the counter. She treated us like dirt at check out. She tried to act like I didn't give her the gift card when it was sitting right in front of her. She told me to check my purse again. Then she said that a tip was required so I had to add it to my gift card. I told her I had already tipped in cash and she said \""RIGHT\"" with a snarky attitude. I would never go back to this Euphoria. There right out or beauty school girls have no manners. Don't waste your time or money."
1,I was in town for business and badly needed a pedicure. My colleague and I went to this place and had a great experience for the money. \n\nThe place isn't fancy but for about $22 dollars they provide you services that other places would charge you 45 to 50 dollars.\n\nStaff very friendly.
0,"Ate there last night with a group of friends.  The waitstaff was friendly, but that was pretty much the only good thing of the night.  I hate french onion soup that was so salty, it tasted like a salt lick.  Plus, they put so many croutons in the soup, I was only actually afforded about two small spoonfuls of soup before the liquid was soaked up.  I ordered the bluegill for my main dish.  Being an avid fisherman, I can appreciate some good Wisconsin bluegill.  This bluegill, however, was not good.  It was cold and tasted very old.  The fries that went along with it were also extremely salty.  A couple people in the group said their food was okay, but definitely not worth a trip back.  I was quite bummed about this."
0,"Pretentious.  Boring.  Nice atmosphere.\n\nMy wife and I went early on a Saturday night, like 5:30 or 6.  Place was totally empty, but the host tried to put us at the table next to the bathrooms.  I suggested another table and we were reluctantly permitted to sit at a 4-top.  But we were sternly warned that if anybody else needed the table, we'd have to move or leave.  Seriously, the restaurant was empty and you were going to put us at your worst table?  Why punish your customers for arriving early?  And then be a jerk about it?  His attitude did not start things off well.  \n\nFood was bland.  Not innovative or hip.  Trying to be, but not.  Definitely overpriced.\n\nDecor and atmosphere were cool though.\n\nOh, and the place didn't fill up before we left.  Most of the others were in groups of two, sitting at 4-tops.  I wonder how many of them were threatened too?\n\nGo to the Main Ingredient.  It's better in every way."
0,"I first visit to this location was for a battery replacement.  They told me that they could not pro-rate it because it was not their battery.  I later found the O'Reilly receipt showing the battery purchase.  They also installed the wrong battery (according to Costco AND my dealership).  When confronted they actually argued that it was the right battery even though it was half of the size of the original!  Today, I tried to purchase new windshield wiper blades.  When they did not fit, I went back to get the right ones.  Once again they argued that they were correct, even though the clips were visibly different.  In a failed attempt to prove me wrong, they attached it incorrectly to the motor arm even though the instructions had a diagram showing that this was an incorrect installation.  Even after I showed them the proper installation technique using the original blade, they continued to argue that they were the correct blades.  Wow, really?.  If you care about your car, I recommend avoiding this business."
1,"Although there are SO many places in and around Charlotte, and Voci is a standing classic. This is my FAVORITE and best experienced massage loca in the QC. I have only had one particular therapist, Mary R. She is phenomenal people! \nVoci actually made a mistake years back, scheduled me for a neuromuscular instead of a swedish. BEST mistake ever! Now that is all I go for... you will not regret scheduling a massage with Mary R!"
0,"I love the food court at this mall, but thats about it. The security guards are very rude and not helpful at all! I also don't agree with the 50 smokers in the outside area. I used to enjoy sitting out there with my daughter and husband, but now it's nothing but full of tobacco smoke and pre-teens. Still better than metro center though..."
1,"Great American cuisine, good variety of choices. Love all the TVs - perfect sports environment!! Great for watching games. Ordered take out several times and they have not gotten order correct a few times but for the most part very good service. I would definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone in the area!"
0,"On the way back and forth from the Ritz and the Bank of America Corporate Center I walked past Ivy & Leo for a few days and loved what I saw in the windows. It is usually closed when I walk past so I made a plan to come by during my lunch break to check it out. The boutique has a lot of beautiful clothes and accessories for women. The accessories range for $10-$60 and the clothes may have been a little overpriced for my penny-pinching self. I found a dress that I currently own for $35 when I got it for $20 in NY. There were a couple of pieces from Forever Twenty-One that I know is half the price in Dallas. I also found that their t-shirts are the same ones that I can find at Marshalls for $5. I actually own a few of the same t-shirts. It is a fairly small boutique but has really cute stuff. I've been eyeing a couple of bags and scarves but since I'm so frugal and know I can find it cheaper in Dallas I didn't buy anything. Plus, I brought only a carry-on and my laptop bag. I may not have room in my luggage if I went on a shopping spree."
1,"Just breakfast and lunch, with an emphasis on breakfast. I love that the waffle and pancake choices include not only what they put ON them, but also what goes IN them. I had orange/cranberry IN the batter, and strawberries and bananas ON my waffle. It was really good but the cranberries were a bit overwhelming. It's about $3 more to add bacon and eggs if you're hungry enough for them. I stuck with the waffle and was completely satisfied. They had a breakfast special running with marinated steak that look and smelled wonderful. Maybe I'll venture away from my usual next time and give that a try. You can spend from $5 to $15 per person so if you're watching the budget (like I am toward the end of the month) you can still find a good breakfast."
1,"If you like Cheesecake Factory then you will like Grand Lux....Similar food and same owners. \n\nOn my most recent Vegas trip my friends and I stayed at Palazzo Hotel. Since Grand Lux was located there it was a convenient place for us to go for some food.\n\nI came here for breakfast with my friends. For breakfast they offer a breakfast buffet, which is a pretty good deal and they food is good too.\n\nI went here again for some late night grub and their pasta dishes were really good. My friends and I got the Chicken Alfredo and the Pasta with sun dried tomatoes."
1,"This weekend the wife and I decided to try out this Pita Jungle location. We'd eaten at the one in Tempe with friends, but this one is much closer to home.\n\nFirst off, the food we ate was excellent.  We ordered essentially the same thing as we did at the Tempe Pita Jungle: Chicken Hummus.  This is grilled chicken piled atop of 3 different types of hummus.  This time we went with the Cilantro Jalapeno Hummus, Roasted Bell Pepper Hummus, and the Garlic Dip. I love the Cilantro Jalapeno, my wife was a fan of the Roast Bell Pepper, and we both really like the Garlic Dip.  Two pieces of Pita Bread apiece dipped in this delicious hummus was more than enough to fill us up. We even had plenty of leftovers.\n\nI know they have other tasty stuff on the menu and I'd really like to try them, but this one dish is so good I'd be going back to Pita Jungle if that was the only thing on the menu.\n\nMy one complaint about this place is that the acoustics are terrible.  The restaurant was a little over half full and we could barely hear our waitress. Although, if she just would have spoken up it may have been less of an issue.  She did make up for it, though, by offering us our drinks in to go cups when we were getting ready to leave and came back with giant cups of tea (If you're looking for a tasty drink, try their green tea.)\n\nPita Jungle is definitely a place I recommend eating, and I'm sure we'll be back sooner than later."
1,"Ahh Trader Joes, thanks for showing me that I can get a bag of groceries for only 20 bucks. This was my first visit to a Trader Joes and I am a fan of the good prices and quality of food. \n\nThe location was conveniently located in a parking deck, although parking was hard to find as I went right before dinner time. It is a smaller location and pretty easy to maneuver your way around, which can be helpful if you are running low on time.\n\nI was super excited when I made my way to the back and ended up with some free coffee and chocolate samples. \n\nThere was a great selection of produce and other products that I cannot find in general grocery stores. I'll definitely be back."
1,"I love this location!  All of the baristas there are super nice, friendly, knowledgeable and make you feel at home!  They are very personal and they all take time to get to know you as a person.  My favorite barista there is Darren!  Make sure you come in a say hi to him!  They are quick and efficient, especially during their peak times.  The store is always clean and organized.  You will not be disappointed when you stop in here for your beverage of choice!"
1,"My mom and dad were in town on Sunday afternoon. After great internal debate of what Charlotte-area restaurant would best suit them for lunch, I decided on The Liberty. It was a solid choice. \nWe got there around 12:30, and I figured we'd end up having to sit in the bar area since the dining room was full-up. But the pint-sized Asian hostess was able to immediately fit us into a booth/seat along the central amber-glowing beer wall. \nOur waitress, Kristin may have been her name, a proud and tall curly-haired brunette with a slight caramel tint to her pale skin, greeted us forthright with brunch menus, and welcomed us with a sincere smile. In my opinion, The Liberty and Brazwell's Pub on Montford are in stiff competition for maintaining the most attractive wait staffs in Charlotte. As I glanced around the dining room, I struggled to identify which of the tight-black-clad waitresses exceeded the others in form and virtue. I couldn't rank them; they're all just flawless. \nMy mother, admiring the pallet-wood walls, barrel-keg columns, and frothy-yellow suds inlaid the back-lit wall behind her, turned to me and said, \""So... this is basically a bar? A pub?\"" \nI laughed. \""Yes, um... it's a restaurant. And a bar. All restaurants are bars these days. Charlotte has evolved into a drinking city of late. We have like nine breweries and a hundred new restaurants. It's a foodie town now.\"" \nI checked out the brunch menu. I didn't even realize The Liberty had brunch. Apparently that's a new ubiquitous Charlotte dining offering as well. I browsed the options under the brunch heading - typical fair: omelettes, shrimp and grits, steak and eggs, etc. But for me, The Liberty is a burger joint. It'd be silly to deviate from what they do best. I was, however, particularly moved by the listing in the bottom left corner of the menu - Bottomless Mimosas for $12. Not something I could really do with the folks, but I'd be back for those. \n\""I'm getting a beer,\"" I said. \""You guys want beer?\"" \nMy mother declined, but my dad was into it. \""I want something dark,\"" he said. \nI scanned the beer list - lagers, pale ales, double IPAs, Guinness (eh, maybe), a couple ambers, some of the traditional OMB and Triple C options, but nothing particularly dark. I wanted to order a local beer, but none was quite fitting. Kristin returned, \""You guys know what you're drinking?\"" \n\""We need something dark-ish. How dark is this Imperial Stout?\"" \nShe kind of wavered. \""It's... good,\"" she said. \""Maybe not that dark, though.\"" \nMy dad was easily sold. I went for a Triple C Light Rail Pale Ale, which I stuttered out in awkward tongue-twister form. Eh, she knew what I meant. \nThe beers came quickly. I sampled my father's Imperial Stout; it was, indeed, good - kind of rich and earthy with a sharp after-taste. I'm never disappointed by a pale ale, so I found my Light Rail satisfying - just enough hop to give it a flinch, but easy enough to match most any meal. I tried to get my mother to order a beer or a glass of wine, but she declined. She explained that beer had never suited her. She also later explained that marijuana didn't suit her either; it would cause her to get light-headed and faint. I found that hilarious and adorable; it's amazing the things you learn about your parents in adulthood that you would never be privy to as a child. \nWe ordered: my dad went with the brisket burger; mom got the signature Liberty Pub Burger. I decided to go rogue and try the fish n' chips. Kristin scribbled it all down, nodded, smiled, fetched our menus, and spun away. \nMy mom cleared her throat. \""So, honey...\"" she began, \""I was reading your Yelp reviews...\""\n\""Oh, dear...\"" \n\""Those ones from Philadelphia... I was reading them with your sister...\""\n\""Oh, dear...\""\nShe paused to choose her next words. \""We were trying to decide if you're embellishing these things, or if you really drink that much...\""\nI laughed. \""Everything that happened is one-hundred percent true. I only embellish the language; everything situational is real.\"" \nShe nodded. \""Well, if that's the case... I don't think we like this Huxley very much.\"" \nI laughed again. \""Well, ya know, we've had a weird relationship. I don't really understand why she is the way she is, but I try to give people the benefit of the doubt.\"" \n\""I don't think you should see her anymore,\"" my mother asserted. \nI nodded. \""Yeah, that's probably not even really up to me...\""\nFrom there, the conversation steered elsewhere. Kristin returned in short time with our entrees. My folks were impressed; I was too. My dad methodically destroyed his brisket burger; my mother only managed half of her Pub burger, but that was a lot for her. I melted over my fish and chips, so much beer batter... so much malt vinegar. And we all salivated mindlessly over the crispy, seasony fries. \nAt the end, my dad and I argued briefly over the check, before I relented. He is, after all, my elder. \n\""Are you going to Yelp about this one?\"" my mom asked me. \n\""Yes, mother. I am.\"""
1,"Love this hotel, my favorite part is the view at night you can see the city. The rooms were clean no bugs and doesn't smell.."
1,"My husband and I lovingly refer to Phoenix Ranch Market as Food City on Crack!  This place is amazing, but be prepared for a bit of culture shock as this is a truly authentic Mexican grocery store.  I have only walked the perimeter of the store, which is the bakery, fish market and carneceria. \n\nThe bakery is phenomenal,  I would especially recommend the dulce de leche cake.  Next stop fish market, with an excellent seafood spread.  You can order food-to-go straight from the market, I recommend the shrimp ceviche.  Next stop the meat market - Wow!  Some interesting food you would not find at your local Albertson's.  Carne Asada (marinated) is an excellent and cheap choice to take home and have a mexican bbq in your very own backyard.  \n\nThe restaurant next door is also very good - great seafood enchiladas.  There are also soom little shops with items you would expect to find at a border town shop."
1,"Perhaps my expectations were too high because of all the hype I'd heard, but I have to say I was a little disappointed. We did a girls' night out and were so excited about this new great wine/chocolate combo thing, but after waiting forever for a table we waited forever for a waitress, who utimately messed up our order and brought us first the wrong food and then cold food. When they finally got the food right, it was actually pretty goos, but by that time were were kind of over it. As for dessert, we ended up going with these chocolate martinis that were pretty rockin. My suggestion is head there for drinks but not for food."
1,"Had a problem with my Lower splash shield underneath my front bumper hanging, called in and they told me to come in so they could take a look. After a short wait they took my car in and the mechanic fixed the problem with ease, free of charge but I wanted to give him a tip. Excellent service, and I will definitely be back if I have any car problems."
1,Had Pho today and it was awesome.  Never a disappointment. Only reason why I give 4 stars is because of the smell its been having the past two times ive been here. Like a wet mop smell. Makes my appetite shifty but the food is oh so good.
1,"I had great service at the Tempe Marketplace Cox retail store today. I had to drop off my dvr and change my phone service so I drove down to the Cox store. As I entered there was a service representative there to greet me. He took the dvr, walked over to the counter and made the changes in immediately. I think that I was in and out in less than 5 minutes. The representative was both courteous and efficient."
0,Went there looking for a good piece of protein. Got a recommendation from the bartender on the Filet. I ordered it Medium and it came out rare. They took it away from me and recooked it. It was okay. Nothing special. I would definitely try out one of the other hundred steakhouses in the area before going back to J. Alexanders.
1,"We ordered the Sloppy Joe, Cheeseburger, regular fries and french toast fries.  Everything was excellent.  We have been trying to find a local burger place that isn't a chain and this was everything we hoped for including being a \""hole-in-the-wall.\""  Some of the best places are hidden gems, and this would be one of them. \n\nThe burger was cooked to order, the regular fries were perfect, the Sloppy Joe was our \""wildcard\"" order and it was surprisingly delicious - add to that the french toast fries and it was like having a dessert with our lunch.  Will be back."
0,"We had visited the place during 4th July weekend. Right as we stepped in, we felt that the host was non-welcoming. The lunch buffet didn't really have enough options if you were a vegetarian. So we ordered a la carte. The curries were ordinary, and surprisingly even the breads weren't good. What we were most dissatisfied with, was their service - sloppy to say the best."
0,"To Tristan,\n  I do not believe it is appropriate to write a review for your own company and give yourself 5 stars. I would consider that very unethical.  I also consider it to be very bad business to divulge other people's personal information to the public.  \n  You are a terrible business man and I hope people can see that through your poorly written response, which by the way is completely inaccurate. \nAny reasonable consumer will clearly see that your lack of professionalism and complete disregard for any ownership or accountability for your company's actions is reason enough to never do business with you."
1,"Love the food and love the atmosphere(M location is my fav.)  During our last visit, admittedly on a Saturday, the service was less than stellar.  Not usually an issue, but something to consider if visiting on the weekend.  Otherwise what is not to like!"
0,"The d\u00e9cor is unique. It is bigger than a caf\u00e9. The waiter was not impressive at all. Not friendly, tossed our utensils on the table and one almost slid off the other side of the table. Never asked if we needed anything or refills on our drinks. My husband ordered the ABC Omelet. He said for the price it was very small portioned. But also the home fries you could barely taste some seasoning and the omelet was BLAH!! I got the buttermilk pancakes (3) with a side of sausage links. The pancakes covered my entire plate, golden brown and sure soaked up my maple syrup!! They were ok kinda dry. I don't like my pancakes swimming in syrup and they were not and I still needed more syrup to make them wet looking. My sausage links I did like the flavor and they were good. We then sat there for a good 20 min waiting for our check and someone else came and gave it to us not our waiter. For all we got it the cost was $32 and change!! Not impressed will not be coming back."
1,"I have been to nail salons in 5 states, and this is the best that I have been to.  Kate, the owner, knows everyone's name and is always happy to see you when you walk in. The prices aren't cheap, they are similar to other salons, but the service and technique's are the best.  I have had gel nails and pedicures.  They do the best gel nails that I have ever had.  At other salons after a few times my nails get brittle because they scrape and over buff them.  AZ Tips and Toes use the right techniques and keep your nails healthy.   \n\nI don't know about the negative post from Rae.  I have had 5 different people work on me (Kate, Trish, Ang, Deja, and Grace).  They have all been great.  Also the salon always smells good when I am in there.  It smells the least like nail polish of any salon that I have been in.  In fact I walked in with my 5 year old a couple of weeks ago and he said \""wow it smells good in here\"".  Lastly, they have like 500 color choices.  They have a palate of gel nail polish, and I think it goes up to at least 300 hundred.  I always have a hard time picking a color because there are so many choices. I don't know if she was at the same salon or it was an off day or something.  I have been going consistently for several months and I highly recommend AZ Tips & Toes."
1,"Definitely would go back, only loses a star because some items on the menu are painfully overpriced - like PAIN..and not the good kind. But overall, the food is absolute delicious - and if you're not a pretentious portuguese little twat like some people who have written terrible reviews of this restaurant for no reason, you'll enjoy yourself. Get the beer on tap and anything with the \""home made piri piri sauce\"" - both are insanely delicious.\n\nOrdered the lobster rolls and the crispy calamari to start - both delicious, both moderately priced. The calamari had an interesting batter to it, not one you would usually expect but we enjoyed it much more because of that!. There were 3 lobster rolls! which is a good portion for 14$ that's a pretty sweet deal.... ok, the lobster wasn't the freshest but it was really good anyways..suggestion! should any of the owners bother to read this review: can you indicate, for the love of piri piri, the AMOUNT you are getting for every menu item please. i though it was 1 lobster roll and my boyfriend had to ask the waiter about the rib and chicken plate for servings, also we made a mistake and over-ordered on desert - annoying -\n\nMains: chicken club with fries and salad and the bf took the chicken and ribs combo. Ribs were melt-in-yo-mouth but the sauce wasn't great. The chicken was delicious all-around. He had 2 drumsticks and the chicken in my club was a breast - all delicious and cooked to perfect tenderness. The piri piri sauce though - WOW. Good job on that, whoever makes it, I wanted to take some home, it was SO good.\n\nAs for the desert, we got Natas. My only problem was with the waiter: we made a mistake and ordered two orders of natas, we asked him to take one order out literally 30 seconds later and he said he couldnt do it because he already punched it in. The heat from his fingertips touching the touch screen cash hadn't even worn off when he told us this. desert cost us 16$ and we couldn't finish because it was too much food. This made me particularly mad because I've worked both in restaurants and retail and I know my way around a cash..you can delete an item soooo easily a caveman can do it and as for the chefs in the back...we literally asked as soon as he finished punching it in so really, there shouldn't have been a problem. If he was looking to add an extra menu item - he succeeded, if he was looking for tip - fat chance - that was a complete dick move but then again, I don,t expect much from Laval service staff - tips and ass on a stick for the waitresses and meat-for-brains waiters.\n\nOther than that, great time and great food!"
1,"By far one of the best Vietnamese restaurants I've been to in Phoenix! The most bang for your buck by far, at any rate. Their Pho is \""pho-nomenal\"" (ha!) with every kind of authentic ingredient you can imagine! It's a great place to get a great meal for about the price of a McDonald's value meal, and the food is 100 times better and better for you! The fried rice is great, I'm partial to the beef and pork. The barbequed pork and shrimp rice combos are pretty darn good too. Try the addition of the vietnamese shrimp paste. There's a very decent vegetarian selection too, for all you non-meat-eaters out there. \n\nTo drink, try the Thai iced tea with tapioca (boba). I'm a fan of Thai iced tea and a fan of boba and it's one of the few restaurants in town that combines the two!"
1,"Came to breakfast with a large group while in Vegas for a Birthday trip. It was so nice to eat off the strip and have a great cooked meal. Everyone in my party loved their dishes. I had Eggs Benedict, which was wonderful. \n\nWhy I rated it a 4... server wasn't great. She was nice, friendly, and polite but wasn't real attentive. We had a long wait to have our order taken too. The coffee... was not drinkable. I love coffee w my breakfast food so that was kinda a disappointment but the Eggs Benedict made up for it!!"

0,"We have been going to this office for the past 5 years with no issues.  During my children's last visit, we received a new dentist.  The dentist never introduced himself nor did he give any detailed explanation other than both of my children had cavities and that my 10yr old need to be put to sleep in order to have them filled.  When our visit had ended and the dentist started to walk away, I stopped him and stated I still had questions.  I wanted to know if my son need to see an orthodontist for his overbite, to which he said yes it was probably a good idea since many of his permanent teeth came in.  I felt that is something he should have mentioned to me instead of me inquiring.  Upon leaving I was asked to schedule an appointment and received estimates for both children to have their cavities filled.  The total for both children was close to $600 out of pocket.  I was so dissatisfied that I decided to have the services performed somewhere else.\n\nI scheduled services at another office for a check-up. That dentist showed me their x-rays and stated they had no cavities.  Upon exanimating my son's teeth, he stated that one of his molars formed a hole that need to be filled to prevent a future cavity.  The hole was not a cavity but the way the tooth had grew.  The new office was exceptional by comparison, very informative and caring."
0,"This is my second time visiting this store location.  I was excited about coming in this time since they were so helpful at first.  As soon as I walked in no one said hi ,can I help you. So I stood by the register hoping someone would say something.  Everyone seemed too busy twirling there hair. Until I finally asked someone behind the counter for help and she puts a finger up and helps a customer that walked in after me. I finally  got what I needed and have decided to never visit this location again."
0,"The male scans over the females on the dancefloor looking for his perfect mate.\r\n\r\nHis eyes lock onto his target.  He approaches his potential mate cautiously.  Casually, he walks toward her general area and begins his mating dance.  He dangles his lanky arms and legs, writhing to a rhythm found not in the top 40 hits being played, but only in his head....and in his heart.  He draws nearer but makes no move to communicate verbally to his love.  He is certain that she (as his true love) can SENSE and FEEL the MUTUAL connection they have.\r\n\r\nThe window of opportunity is open and the male jumps through it!  He grabs the female around the waist, pulling her closer to him.  He wants to show her how \""manly\"" he truly is.  But wait! What's this?!

0,"I will definitely be back for a review update.\n\nI was just upset that their kitchen is currently under construction and there were only four things on their menu, all that I did not want. I mean I would not have been as upset, but I did call the night before and asked about whether they were opened and mentioned I was excited because driving from Flagstaff. Who I talked to did not even mention that the kitchen was under construction. Such a disappointment after a long drive and we really got our hopes up. \n\nThe oatmeal stout however, was outstanding."
1,"Good food, good atmosphere, would recommend it.  Cant go wrong with what you order.  I have had lunch here twice and have not been disappointed."
1,If you need to relax after work and craving for margarita. This is the place! The bar is small and cute and the restaurant has a homey feeling. The service is friendly. They offer complimentary chips and salsa. \nLas Fuentes offers different flavors of margarita! I tried the mango flavored margarita and I am hooked! The prices of the drinks are okay and they do offer discounted drinks during happy hour.
1,Was a quite evening in tempe! Excellent food and service!
1,Yum. Ice cream made on premesis in a mind-boggling array of flavors. Home made waffle cones too. Outside seating on the main square in Mint Hill. Beats any chain hands-down.

1,"Revo Burrito is a place that is close by 24 hour fitness gym off Camelback that is open late.  I went with a few friends here after a late workout. They have burritos, bowls, tacos, and more.  I opted for the healthy chicken burrito bowl, which was okay.  My friends had burritos and were really impressed by them.  I would have to say that the wide array of menu options was really appealing, and I want to go back there and try a burrito some time."
1,"Man, I don't get how so many people down this place. I've never had anything but great experiences, whether ordering for delivery or going in.\n\nTheir pies are the best that I have tasted in Pittsburgh (so far). So many other joints I have tried mess up the crust, which once you've screwed up the base you've got nothing else. But their pizza crust is thick and chewy, just the way I like it.\n\nI love how they load their pizzas up with toppings (another thing that some pizza places skimp on, which makes for an angry Quay!). Everything tastes fresh and incredibly flavorful.\n\nWe ordered in from Genoa's on the nights where we really don't feel like cooking. They were a godsend when we were in the process of moving. We've always managed to get our food delivered well before the quoted time, piping hot, and the delivery guys and the guys who take our order are always pleasant."
0,"It pains me somewhat to hand out 2 stars to this place because I do like the food and have had two enjoyable meals here, but I feel somewhat scammed, so I don't think I'd want to go back because this makes me uncomfortable.\n\nWill start with the scam, have been to Pampas a couple of years ago, it was great.  So recently a groupon came up for sale and I figured I'd buy it.  $100 for $50 in food, how could I go wrong?  Well I found out.  Pampas artificially inflates their retail prices and then offers discounts through various venues (Ticket for tonight, groupon, people handing out flyers in the mall) to make people think they are getting a good deal.  So in the end you just end up paying about what you'd pay at any other restaurant....as long as you use your coupon (I feel for the poor people that don't utilize some sort of coupon at Pampas). \n\nFor example:\nSeafood buffet - $48\nMeat buffet - $44\n\nIn Vegas you can find far better values for much less than that, or even splurge and eat somewhere higher end for about the same price.\n\nSo I guess with Groupon I expect to get some sort of bargain or deal, and I felt like i didn't here.  So I feel like I've been taken advantage of.  Thus I must rate this place as two stars.\n\nThe food is really quite good.  The meat tastes delicious and the salad bar is quite good.  The service is OK, the waiter was actually the same guy for both visits.  He has a very thick accent and is somewhat difficult to understand, but he's very good at his job.  They didn't seem to have much of a clue when it came to helping us with our baby, so if you have a little one you may want to steer clear."
1,"The best buffet experience in Las Vegas, for sure. Everything is in artfully prepared in small dishes and not in huge feeding troughs. Presentations of each station is good and clean. \n\nSome of the food was a little off, though. All of the Asian-inspired dishes were either incredibly sweet or incredibly salty (sushi included). The pizza might have tasted good but certainly didn't look edible in the least. The desserts are the highlight. Gelato is P.E.R.F.E.C.T.  Literally, their maker is the best in Vegas. \n\nThe service is also the nicest and most attentive buffet servers and cashiers ever! Everyone was super friendly and as soon as our plates were done they were cleared right away."
1,"The purple rice was a real treat. Slightly grainy and earthy but still a great addition to the nigiri. The owner greeted and think every customer, was joking delightfully with his staff, And added to a great experience. I had the chefs choice plate and was delighted with the pieces included."
0,"I've left my more favourable review underneath because I suppose it still stands but my last visit wasn't very good at all, it was also a strange experience. \nWhen I went up to order, the girl behind the counter quite clearly didn't like me. I'm not too fussed about big smiley North American service but she was so dour and never looked at me, once I started talking. My burrito (and I've had a few) was chucked together with not much of anything in it. When my girlfriend and our friend ordered, she was all smiles to them! \nNot sure if it's because I is male or maybe it was just my face. \nAnyway..I also ordered and paid for chicken wings which never came. When I went up for a refund (we had finished our meals) a guy at the till apologised a few times and said he didn't know anything about the order. The girl did, but again, refused to look at me or say sorry. Another guy came from the kitchen, also apologised and asked how I'd like my refund. Again, standing next to him, she had a chance to say sorry to me or even to him but never did. I told the guy that it was fine and that I had eaten enough anyway, I'm just interested to know what I did to rub up the staff member the wrong way!Been here a couple of times and I'm impressed. The burrito is the best I've had in Edinburgh. It's also probably the biggest for the cheapest in the quickest time. I would recommend the steak burrito with spicy salsa. It's huge though so you probably don't need to order a side dish to yourself but maybe one to share. I ahem..ordered buffalo wings for myself which are also great but very spicy, I'd recommend a beer or two to cool down with. Interestingly, my girlfrined and I assumed it was a chain because it has that look about it but it's not, there's only the one, and it's in Edinburgh. You'd think they would give it more personality but I suppose the spartan surroundings are cheaper to create and cheaper to clean and maintain."
1,"Great food!!! Everyone at the table loved their food, plus the staff is amazing!!!! Arnold and Jaime were the best.  Wish I lived here to visit more!"
1,"We went in January for dinner as my husband received a gift card. Yes, this place is pricey, but well worth it. The service is phenomenal. They even have bathroom attendants! \n\nMy husband got the bone-in filet and I got the king crab legs. He ordered the wedge salad and I had the chopped salad. We had the sugar snap peas and scalloped potatoes as sides. Even though he asked for the filet as medium, it came medium rare. He didn't mind. I had a bite and while it was very tender, I would have sent it back for more cooking. My king crab legs were fantastic. Perfectly cooked - not too salty or too watery. The sugar snap peas were crisp and the scalloped potatoes were very rich. \n\nOur server was spot on until we finished our meal. She was being attentive to a large table, but we were ignored for a good 10-15 minutes once our entree dishes were cleared. This is the reason I didn't give 5 stars. \n\nI think this is a great place to go for a special occasion dinner. We're not the only ones who think that because the restaurant was packed in early January."
1,Needed quick dinner before seeing Jersey Boys. In and out in less than an hour with party of four. Had the best shrimp scampi ever. EVER! Six huge shrimp and a very pleasant sauce with the pasta. Also had great warm sourdough bread. Everyone in party was full and happy.
0,"Well, It has a colorful menu board?!\n\nUnfortunately, that's about all Tacos Jalisco has that appeals to me.  I've eaten there twice and the first time the food wasn't memorable (literally, I don't remember it).  The second time the food was so bland it made me want to cry.  I had the gorditas carnitas.  It was hot, but there was absolutely no flavor...or texture.  It was basically hot Mexican mush, and that describes the beans and the rice too.  \n\nThe staff was friendly, and the place was clean.  I'm not sure if the guy in the corner is selling bootlegged CDs or not, but it seems kinda sketchy to me.\n\nHans really loves this place, but I am not sold.  At all."
1,"Very nice environment, with good view to the music fountain. The service was nice too, the a little bit pricy."
1,"My go-to ice cream place in the summer! The lines are usually long and you have to wait a while, but they have some delicious snowstorms! They also have a drive-thru, which I have never used, but that is because I like to sit out front at the tables in the parking lot. Perfect place to go with friends on a beautiful summer night for a yummy treat!"
1,"First time staying at the Mirage, and I was very happy with the experience.  Awesome pool, cabana at Bare on the first day, ridiculously fun bartenders at Kokomo's every night that kept our party going until (gulp!) 6 in the morning...not to mention Carnegie Deli *right there*.  The RhumBar is killer, and the spa will help you \""detox so you can retox\"" right up there with the best of them...We literally had everything that we needed right inside the hotel, and we appreciated that there was no smell of smoke anywhere we went.  \n\nRooms were comfy, and soundproof! Did not hear any of the outside noise that other yelpers here have complained about.  \n\nPool service was great, though I docked one star for the non-hotel guests that seem to make it in.  Club promoters seem to have no problem, though we can't really complain about the club comps that they provided our group.   Still though, makes you wonder.  With the pool that packed, they would do good to make it a bit more exclusive..."
1,so underrated...but BEST.TOFU.ever. \n\ncrispy or bbq tofu... \n\nget get get someeee
0,Used to love this place. But they are always rude and they never fail to get my order terribly wrong.
0,"Meh.  The products are overly scented and not very effective.  The experience I've had when shopping has been lukewarm.  The associates aren't bad.  They just give canned phrases like \""Can I help you find anything\"" and \""I'm blah blah blah if you need anything.\""  I want to have a friendly interaction and find something with someone who genuinely wants to help me, not someone who is worried about making a quick sale.  BBW is not really known for providing stellar service; the products match."
1,"I have been to East Coast Eats many times over the past 6 months and each visit has been extraordinarily enjoyable.  From the friendliness of the staff to the wide range of menu items to the cleanliness of the establishment to the value for the prices this is an excellent place to dine for lunch or dinner.  I especially enjoy the tuna sandwich, both the garden salad and the chicken caesar salad and even the hamburgers are plump and juicy.  Although it is clear from the decor the place is operated by passionate Boston sports fans I had the same outstanding experience whether I dress incognito or wear my New York Yankees t-shirt!  The food and the service is consistent and those are two of the most important factors I use in deciding whether a place is a one time wonder (or wonder why) or a place I will return to time and again.  East Coast Eats is part of my weekly routine!"
0,"We thought that when the name changed they may have also improved the quality of the food, but we were wrong. It really is not worth going again. Best thing is the fact that they are open late. But McDonald's is too so you may as well go there. Better food and way cheaper."
1,This is my favorite stadium to watch a spring training game. Maybe it's because I remember watching the Firebirds play here and well the tickets are cheap. I even get a $2-4 discount with my credit union debit card. \n\nThey sell Nathan's hot dogs! Yum! They also have margaritas and snow cones. You can't go wrong with either. \n\nThe views here are amazing although trying to get into the parking lot sucks. Great location. Not too far from Tempe or south Scottsdale.
0,"This place sucks, not my normal car wash, but was in a hurry and needed to wash my car. They did a horrible job for a $20.00 car wash. And I don't think anyone there spoke English. Everything in the shop was overpriced.  Had been here once before, and I could not remember why it had been so long...now I remember. RIP OFF!"
0,"I've lived in Madison for almost 8 years now and somehow had never made my way over to Bluephies, which I had heard was great for years. Last week I was finally in the area and suggested going to my friend who lives nearby. We went for dinner on a Tuesday night and I can't say I was impressed. \n\nWe were seated immediately in the center of their main dining room and told our server would be right with us. About 10 minutes went by and still no one had come over to our table, even to give us a couple of waters. Several other tables had been seated since we arrived and they had all received water and their other drink orders. Eventually we made eye contact with one of the servers who went straight to the other servers and pointed to us. After that our waitress came right over and apologized (apparently there was some confusion over who's section we were in). She was very friendly, but didn't offer to do much to make up for our 15 minute wait. \n\nI ordered a couple of their specialty vodka cocktails. They were fine, but nothing special. The zucchini appetizer with french onion dip was delicious and was the best part of the meal. For my entr\u00e9e I ordered the chile rellenos and was pretty disappointed. The menu described a pepper stuffed with rice, mushrooms and spinach. If there was anything besides rice in the pepper I couldn't see it or taste it. The black bean corn relish was mostly a heaping pile of black beans, next to a far too large helping of mole. The \""avocado salad\"" was a dollop of guacamole. Overall the dish wasn't bad in terms of taste, however it was entirely too small. Poblano peppers aren't too big but for 16 dollars I guess I expected more than one or for it to be battered and fried like I've had before. It was really just a small pepper with a bit of rice inside and a ton of black beans and mole. The topper of it all was our waitress decided to crack some joke about how hungry I must have been to have eaten so quickly. I had to bite my lip to avoid asking her how long it would take her to eat ten bites of food. \n\nOverall the food was slightly above average but WAY overpriced. I mean WAY overpriced. For 16 dollars I can get a much better and much larger meal downtown around the square. I've heard great things about their brunch so maybe dinner just isn't their forte. I'm glad I finally went, but I won't be back. Not for dinner anyway."
1,"Not so cozy and no menu, everything written down on a chalkboard.It wasn't easy to read the menu. However, I ordered the lobster spaghetti and I was in lover with it. A friend had a horse steak and another couple got jarret d'agneau. Huge portions. Food was great along with service. The restaurant is noisy and loud. I would definitely go back!"
1,"We went to see Croods today in one of the new digital theater rooms.  WOW!  I couldn't believe the huge improvement.  \n\nI've never complained about picture quality at this theater - I figure that the low cost of the movie doesn't justify a complaint.  This new system rocks!  Such a great picture and the sound was really good too!  \n\nGreat addition to your theater Pollack!  Thanks so much! \n\nOH, and they now take CREDIT CARDS!"
0,"My fianc\u00e9 and I made a trip up to the store from Southern Phoenix. The yelp location has the store on a corner. However it was in the middle area across the street and down a ways. Not even on the same block or street. When we arrived at 8:15 pm the store was closed and the door was locked. Yelp has the store hour stating it closes at 9 pm on week nights. So much for shopping and spending money there. I did look in and seen a lot of jewelry. Oh well, on to another jewelry store."
1,"I went to GCC on a fluke but ended up loving it! \n\nThe food is home cooked and there are even some vegetarian options! The grilled cheese/mushroom/tomato sandwich is really good, others at the table really enjoyed the roast beef/veggies, the catfish dinner and the cod. All the dishes are ample to huge, the prices are excellent, and the service is great!\n\nI want to try their breakfast and malt shakes soon (but not at the same time:))."
0,"After many months of hearing how delicious Chick-fil-A is I was in the area so I decided to give it a try. Since I have never been here before I bought a regular chicken sandwich, chicken nuggets and some waffle fries for my son and I to share so we could try a variety of things. \nThe service in the drive thru was friendly and quick. I was in and out in no time. The food on the other had left a lot to be desired. To me the fries were a little undercooked but still decent. The chicken nuggets were cooked pretty good and seasoned well. The chicken sandwich was so dry I could barely gag it down. Even after adding some sauce to it, it was still dry. Bottom line it was ok. Nothing I would drive far to get because honestly I could go to Carl's JR and get a better chicken sandwich right by my house. Maybe I expected to much because of how everyone raves about it. I probably won't be back."
1,Wonderful experience.  Everyone raved about their food and rightly so.  I had the seared ahi tuna with wasabi aioli and was soooo sad when I was down to my last bite.  It was a little expensive for two items on the plate but it was delicious.
1,Been here many times. \nGreat food out of the whole hotel. \nThe line control and seating could use some work.\nThe seafood selection isn't like it used to be either. \nStill great!
1,"Bosa has become sort of a tradition for my husband and I before we head out on a road trip. We don't eat them any other time, but we always seem to end up here before taking off. I don't know if its because its early and we need the sugar to stay awake on the road, or if its something about doing something out of the ordinary. Either way, this is the place we come to grab a not so healthy pre road trip breakfast. This location is open 24 hours so if you were craving a doughnut at 3am you could come in and get one.\n\nUsually we grab either a half or full dozen of the fresh doughnuts. I like the glazed kind the best, but the cake ones are good as well, just not my personal preference. My favorite flavors are the traditional glazed, twist glazed, lemon filled glazed, and the apple filled crumb covered ones. My husband is a fan of all of the chocolate kinds and usually gets the long johns and custard filled doughnuts. There are a bunch of other flavors if those don't happen to tickle your fancy.\n\nAs far as doughnuts go I would say these are pretty good. I like them better than Dunkin Doughnuts and places like Safeway and whatnot. They are pretty cheap, and you can also get a dozen doughnut holes for a buck. I would recommend you stop in and at least try one for yourself.\n\nThe only thing I would have to say about this place is the drive through is kind of annoying. It doesn't take very long to get in the store and get out with your goods, but people will still line up around the store for the drive through, which I think takes longer and blocks people from getting out of the parking lot. You are going to be eating a sugar covered dough ball. Just get out of your car and go in the store."
0,"First we get there with a coupon on my iPad for a free adult. We hadn't printed it out to save resources but was told by the lady it will not be honored unless it is printed out (even though it is stated no where on coupon) ok fine.  Paid for 3 adults 3 kids.  Said we would be keeping our 15 month old in the stroller the whole time since he does not walk yet.  She was very rude and stated if we didn't want to pay we could go elsewhere.  She was an older cranky woman who probably should not be working with kids.  There was not a lot for the kids to do once inside.  Jumped on the jump house (which was super dirty and sticky) for about ten minutes, picked a pumpkin went on a hay ride and left,  we had to stretch it out to last an hour.  Definitly not worth 30 bucks!  Take your business elsewhere where they treat their customers with respect and respect the environment."
1,"Well, I did it again.  I made the mistake of taking my husband with me to Tempe on his empty stomach.  After our errand, there was the elephant in the car.  His blood was boiling, he tried to deny it, but you could cut the tension with a knife.  He was hungry.  And although I'm not a huge fan of Thai food, Thai Elephant was right there.  \n\nThe restaurant was clean, staff was friendly, and the food was quick and tasty.  I tried the Elephant Garlic with chicken.  All the veggies were super fresh and still crisp, and the chicken had no suspicious looking or \""discard\"" pieces in it, as Ryan C likes to say.\n\nAlthough I'm not a connoisseur of Thai food, it more than adequately met my criteria to make me a fan!"
0,"First, DirecTV product is great.  The HD channels as well as the content is great.  Love it.  What I don't love it the absolute incompetent people running the place.  I am on my 3rd scheduled visit due to their screw ups the first 2 times.  This is time away from work waiting around for them, and I am sick of it.  If you go with DirecTV, check your service order several times, because more than likely it will be wrong."
0,"1. Like all the other reviews, I waited way past my appointment time.\n2. The tech did not introduce themselves nor talk to me at all to make me feel comfortable.  \n3. They did not once explain what the procedure was or what they were about to do.\n4.  Unlike ALL doctor's offices, the tech did not leave the room when I changed.  Simply said, \""Don't worry, I'll turn around.\""  \n5. There was NO explanation of my results, just a one-word answer.  \n6. They just wanted me to get out.  I was treated like a product and not a person. \n\nHorrible service at this place, please please choose wisely.  I have never had an experience like this with a doctor."
0,"Extremely pricey, rude security guards, super snotty casino dealers and staff.  Beautiful decor and nice rooms, but for sure not worth the price nor the stick in your butt attitude."
0,Overrated. Overpriced. Would not go again.
1,U gotta stop here...
0,"This restaurant looks right out on the strip which is nice.\n\nThe waitstaff was nice but not overly efficient.  When filling our water glasses, the bus boy/assistant waiter noticed no one had brought our bread basket.  Luckily, we didn't want it.\n\nWe had the French Onion soup and three west coast oysters for appetizers.  The soup was great.  The oysters were good.\n\nWe had the duck confit and lamb as entrees, although the duck is an appetizer on the menu.  The duck is definitely a large enough portion to be an entree.  It was cooked perfectly but the confit was bland and there was not a salt shaker on the table (nor any of the others).  That's a pet peeve of mine that chefs think they have perfectly seasoned the food for every palate.\n\nThe lamb was done well, didn't see any eggplant on the plate unless it was the pear-tasting item on the plate.  There was also a very spicy pepper on the plate that was not expected.\n\nWe ordered the duck fries as a side item.  They were super bland.  We had to ask for salt and that did make them edible.\n\nWith all the choices in Vegas, I would choose to eat elsewhere."
0,"If you want anything resembling authentic Mexican food with fresh ingredients, go somewhere else.  This is not the place.  The food is hot, and you get good portions, but the sauces taste like they came out of a jar, and the spices taste like prepackaged blends you can buy at any grocery store."
0,"Great views. Food just okay, nothing great or special. Many of their meals are very spicy. The soup , the coleslaw spicy\n Also very overpriced food. $13.00 for a pastrami sandwich on regular bread with not alot of pastrami. Way overpriced food where the service is good but the food taste & quality needs lots of improvement.  Nothing to write home about. Go for the views & bring your own lunch. The food is not worth the price tag..."
1,"I can't believe nobody has reviewed this wonderful little restaurant yet!  I've been going here for years, first with my parents, who are both from Indiana, then to treat my mother, my husband and kids, even my brother when he was in town.  Where else you gonna find a \""breaded pork tenderloin\"" sandwich!  And it's really good!  They also have great breakfasts.  I had the \""Corn Meal Mush\"" one day and expected a bowl of hot cereal, but it was actually strips of fried cornmeal batter which were delicious with syrup over them.  They came with a generous amount of bacon, too.  They are only open till 2pm so don't dawdle if you want to eat there.  And be sure to try the pork tenderloin!"
1,The food was wonderful!!! And the prices were great too. Had their tacos and chimichanga...both were delicious...especially enjoyed the tacos. A local bar with outside patio....but had great food!
0,"Ok, with all the advertisement and commercials on tv, I've wanted to try Applebees for awhile. \n\nWhen we walked into the restaurant, it wasn't crowded at all. The bar had. a couple of people and only a couple of tables were filled. \n\nFirst of all, service was very slow. It wasn't busy so I couldn't figure that one out. Secondly, I thought it was a little odd that our waitress kept sitting down at a table diagonal to our where a baby and man were eating periodically. Later, I realized that must have been her baby and significant other. Even if the restaurant was slow, I thought that was unprofessional. \n\nWe got the meal deal for $20 that came with an appetizer and two meals. \nThe mozzarella sticks appetizer was pretty good but just like any other place. I got steak which I asked for medium rare and it was cooked well the steak was pretty chewy. My companion had some pasta dish that wasn't so good. \n\nSo overall, price was about the only thing that was good. It kind of reminded me of chili's but I thought Chili's back home in Hawaii was better. it seems like it would be a good family place. But I definitely was disappointed.  ^_^*~"
0,"Stopped by and was surprised at the size of this store. The technology is pretty neat too. BUT  I was very surprised at the prices I looked at. I found everything to be priced high, the staff did not mention the bidding process."
0,"My prior homestead of 11 years was located directly behind Senor Tequila, which has been in this small shopping center off of Rea Rd long before Trader Joe's and the yoga pants crowd took it over, and I used to eat there semi-regularly, always enjoying all that they had to offer.  I had not been for several years and decided to stop here for dinner on the way home tonight.  I was thoroughly unimpressed, which made me a little sad.\n\nComing right after work, I got there around 5:30 ish on a Monday night.  There was a gentleman sitting at the bar and 2 other tables were seated.  I was instantly greeted by a young man who promptly seated me, he turned out to be my server and was very nice, attentive without hovering, but I expected that since the place was basically empty.  I had not eaten here since before they expanded - the seating area is clean and well decorated, and the tables are nicely spaced instead of being slammed on top of each other.  \n\nThe food was by no means bad at all - the flavors were fresh, well presented - there was nothing offensive about anything, it just wasn't anything special.  \n\nThe food:\nTortilla chips - may have been fresh but I didn't think they were particularly tasty.\nSalsa - tomatoes, onions and cilantro.  Tasted fresh, which was nice, but nothing special.  No real oomph. \nQueso - for almost $6, I was expecting cheese dip so good that my toes curled.  Oddly served in a metal lidded bowl, it was fine.  Nothing particularly wrong with it, just fine.  \nShredded beef chimichangas w/ rice and beans $13:  The rice was a little hard and tasteless.  The beans were very smooth and served in a small fried tortilla cup - I did not care for these at all.  I was served two thin chimichangas cut on the diagonal for 4 pieces, with a small amount of queso and a small amount of tomatoes and onions sprinkled on the top.  Again, they tasted fine, but nothing special.  \n\nEverything was a resounding meh.  I have always enjoyed Senor Tequila and maybe I just ordered the wrong thing tonight.  For the cheese dip, chimichangas and a soft drink, my total was $23, not including the tip.  I won't be rushing back, preferring to go to Azteca... or even *wince* On the Border (eek!)."
0,"I am absolutely appalled at the way Flamingo treats their guests.  As regulars in Vegas, my husband and I are used of the level of service at other casinos.  We typically stay at Mirage, Bellagio, or (if my husband is with the guys), Harrah's.  We have always been taken care of, and if anything were to go awry, the casino would do what it could to make us happy.\n\nFastforward to Flamingo.  Booked 2 weeks in advance for a girls trip.  Reserved one of the upgrade rooms.  After a long flight, we were greeted by a SURLY young woman at the front desk and were promptly told that our room was NOT AVAILABLE.  If we wanted a comparable room, we would have to pay an additional $129/night or we could have a roll-out cot in a lesser room.  I was SHOCKED.  Had her speak to a supervisor who was too busy to come out of the back office to talk to us.\n\n I asked her if this is typical at Flamingo and what they are willing to do to keep us at their casino?  \nShe said (and I quote): \""Nothing, you are welcome to stay somewhere else\"".     (?????!?!!!!!!!!!?!!!!!!!!!!!)  \n\nNow, let me just say that the only time this has happened before (room unavailable), Mirage upgraded us at no charge and were extremely apologetic.  Flamingo indicated that there is a fine print on the website, and the deposit doesn't RESERVE the room you want it is only a SUGGESTION for when you arrive to check in.  \n\nNeedless to say, we promptly took our business elsewhere and didn't step foot into Flamingo to gamble or to even buy a drink.  \n\nThe $73 deposit was charged to our visa and was NEVER refunded because while I was there I did not get IN WRITING that we cancelled our reservation.   \n\nIf you're looking for cheap centre strip, stick with Harrah's.  It's not amazing, but at least the staff is friendly and willing to help."
1,Solid sports bar. Everyone in the group enjoyed their meal. Service was good and friendly.  Would definitely be back in the future!
0,"I bought a Groupon to go try Mabuhay Philippine Cuisine, and The Wife and I finally went to use it for dinner this past Saturday. We had heard good-ish reviews for Mabuhay, and were excited to try a new style of food. Unfortunately, the whole experience, from start to finish, ended up being terrible, which led us to give the restaurant the nickname of \""Mabu-bye.\"" We actually walked out of the restaurant before we had even taken a single bite of food, but, lest you think I'm being unfair in this review, please read the whole thing.\n\nThe restaurant is located in a small strip mall along S Park Street, which wasn't a big deal to us because some of our favorite restaurants have been located in strip malls. Our first warning of things to come should have been that there was only one other car parked in the lot at 6:00 pm on a Saturday evening, but we walked in anyway. Upon entering the restaurant, we discovered that there was no one at the cash register, and no indication of whether to seat ourselves or wait for someone to seat us. We saw one waiter running around getting drinks for the 3 tables that were eating, but he never once looked at us. After standing awkwardly in the entrance for a few minutes, we decided to just sit down at a table, at which point a woman who had been sitting and eating at one of the other tables got up and said, \""Yes, wherever you want.\"" Well, that would've been helpful a few minutes ago!\n\nSo, we sat down at a table, and the waiter came over another few minutes later to ask if we wanted drinks. Both The Wife and I ordered water, which he brought out, but  it was lukewarm (no ice at all) and the glasses were barely 3/4 full. He then walked away without saying a word about ordering food.\n\nNow, going in, we knew that the food would be served buffet style, but the waiter did not say whether we could just go up to the buffet or whether he would bring us plates to use first. So, I got up and went to look at the buffet. I discovered a stack of maybe 6 plates that I thought were clean (though I'm still not sure they were), some silverware, and one bowl. I also glanced at the buffet items, and thought, \""Oh, god, what have we gotten into?\"" The Wife came up to join me at the buffet, and while she was looking over the options, I started to serve myself some rice. I dug the rice scoop into the rice cooker only to discover that the rice was so overcooked that it was too hard to push the scoop into. So, I changed my mind about the rice and went to look more closely at the other food options.\n\nNone of the dishes were labeled, so it was a complete guessing game as to what food you might be serving yourself. The stuff that looked like chicken skewers were just sitting in a metal tray perched precariously on the edge of the buffet station, but they looked old and dry. One of the pasta dishes looked so slimy that it literally made me gag, and the other noodle dish looked old and crunchy, which is not how I ever want to eat noodles. The remainder of the dishes looked funky, old (like they had been sitting out for a while), and, again, we had absolutely no idea what any of them actually were.\n\nGiven how terrible EVERYTHING looked and how bad our initial service experience had been, we set our plates back on the table, left $1 to tip for the water, and walked out. I wish I hadn't wasted money on the Groupon to this place, but that sunk cost was minimal compared with our desire to just say, \""Mabu-bye\"" to this disgusting restaurant."
0,"I've disliked this club since it first opened.  First whoever laid it out  was nuts.  Makes no sense to have to walk across a dance floor to get to the bathroom.  I've always thought the music was weak . Making people stand in line to discover an empty club is ridiculous. Last but not least, full of wannabe's."
1,"This place is good. The margaritas are very strong. They have a patio with a fire going. I have been here two times and both times were good. If you go here and the special  of the day is the halibut with red pepper sauce, get it if its not the special ask if they can make it for you! This halibut dish is awsome! The second time i went i was not real hungry so i got the Bondera Platter. Its a lot more food then I was expecting. Its $13 and you get two small soft corn tacos with pork, half a chicken quesadilla, two shrimp, two pieces of grilled beef, two stuffed jalapenos, grilled veggies, quacomole, and queso dip. Lots of food for the money. The quacomole is so good, not much to it but its just so fresh. The service is ok and the decor is nice, a little on the dark side and they have big booths that will seat six. They have a good size bar and a few bar tables right indise the door.  Nice place, good food, fair prices."
1,"Tried this place for the first time today.  Fast, friendly service, good prices, & great tasting food!  \n\nWe got a shredded beef burrito and a carnitas burrito (also shredded).  Both were fantastic and chocked full of meat... just the way we like it. :)\n\nWe will definitely be back.... soon!"
1,"Coming from Baltimore, a city void of palatable Chinese food, I was very surprised (not to mention skeptical) that a great  Szechuan restaurant would be found in Pittsburgh.  I'm glad I was wrong.  The braised pork shoulder is a conversation piece, beautifully prepared and tender to the bite.  I also tried the spicy beef noodle soup and the crispy pork noodles.  If you don't like spicy, stay away, but this stuff was delicious.  I was literally sweating with elation.  Gross and wonderful at the same time.  Next time I want to try the whole fish or the hot pot.  So much to look forward too."
1,"My friend showed me this place. This is why we Yelp because I would have never found this place. Great little Mexican that is about as close to the real thing as you can get. I loved everything I've had but the green chile pork burrito is killer, try it enchilada style."
1,"Just moved into a new place and needed a dog door installed. After waiting weeks for the landlord's service crew to \""get right on that\"", I finally gave up on them and called Mike at Copper State. Not only was he able to fit the job in on the SAME day, he took a few extra minutes out of his way to fix some faulty blinds too! Couldn't be happier with his work or service. Will definitely call him first next time. Highly recommended!"
0,"This review is only pertaining to the organization of the restaurant because, due to their lack of organization, I was unable to experience the food and wine at this new Madison establishment. \n\nWe had inquired about attending a multi course wine makers dinner with wine parings that was advertised via Grgich Hills winery. First, when we called to make reservations, the restaurant was confused and had it on their calendar for 10/29 even though the winery advertised 10/30. We eventually had to call the winery directly to get a straight answer. After a few different conversations, it turns out the dinner will be cancelled due to Rare's lack or organization and marketing of the event. We have yet to be contacted back by Rare and found this information out through the winery. \n\nGuess the is \""The Madison Experience....\"" that will be missed."
0,TWO WORDS - inconsistent & indifferent
1,"Aside from the overpowering odor of weed, pretty good experience.  I came in here all tensed up and defensive, waiting for a bullshit upsell.  To my surprise, it never came.  Maybe It's because they clubbed the lady in front of me like a baby seal.  \n\nIn the end they offered a few upgraded packages but I didn't feel pressured at all.  $10 oil change was legit."
1,"I have been a fan of Firehouse subs for almost 8 years, since I ate at one of the very first restaurants in Jacksonville, Florida. When I stopped traveling for work, Firehouse was one of the chains that I missed the most.\n\nOne day, I was at Cars & Coffee across Eastern, stomach growling, grumbling, nay, SCREAMING for food. When it gets to this point, there is no easy decision, everything and nothing sounds good. Something caught my eye as my head turned to check out a loud car, a familiar white and red sign, no, it couldn't be. Scanning actively for the sign again, staring at it incredulously, I thought I had to be imagining something in my hunger induced haze.\n\nFortunately, I was not imagining it! I made my way across the street to make a Hook & Ladder intimate friends with my belly in short order. Ordering my food, I brought out my trusty Firehouse punch card from the East coast and asked the lady how long they had been open. I was absolutely SHOCKED to find out that they were celebrating their one year anniversary. How could such delicious food be so close to me, and they not advertise at all?!\n\nMy go-to order is always the Hook & Ladder with a sweet tea. The heated turkey and ham, with melty cheese, mayo, lettuce and tomato just hits the spot, even if it doesn't fill me up, check the nickname, bottom-less pit, remember?\n\nI will say that aside from the register worker, most of the staff does seem rather aloof and distant, when busy or slow, they have always been that way at this location. My sandwiches are always good, so that is what keeps me coming back."
0,Major turn of to any establishment is having employees 5 ft. Away from the entrance smoking while standing on a pile of butts. Ewwwww. Another problem is to not have a single clean table. I'm glad I ordered my food to go. The food is reasonably priced and very good but the smoking and cleanliness of the eating area will not make me rush back here any time soon.
1,So far the best place I ever stayed. Everyone is friendly and the food is great! Cool spot  I'll come back.
0,"I really hate this place!! Came here and ate b fast today. Wanted to use my laptop here to do some work on the internet and i needed to plug in, they have free wifi here but no WORKING OUTLETS!!!! How ridiculous is that!  Dont come here to use your laptop or the free wifi!  The workers here dont take concerns seriously they didnt even care that i couldnt find an outlet even when i said i would never come back!!!\n\nwhat an embarassment!!!"
1,"I eat here often and enjoy the food very much.  Ask them for chicken with curry sauce (not on the menu) for a treat.\n\nThe restaurant has moved from the address listed to 1318 Ste Catherine East.  Everything about the new location is better than before.  You can even bring wine or beer in with you (SAC, the liquor store in Quebec, is a block away)."
1,YASSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS\nthe workers are funny though. Poured water into my brother's sprite.  YASSSSS LOL \nIt's okay we forgive you.. \nMuch prefer to keep my brothers sprite not so bland next time tho.
0,"I have mixed feeling about the W Scottsdale. During the day the pool area is poorly run, but in the evenings the pool turns into a pretty fun nightlife spot.  \n\nDaytime:\nThe pool is always jam packed with a fairly disgusting crowd and the dudes out number the babes by a 3 to 1 count I'd say. That's no fun. Oh, and by dudes, I mean douche bags. And Babes? More like gross skanks covered in makeup at the pool. Ok, I guess I'm being a hater, but spend a few hours here and you might be kind of disgusted with the scene too. It's just really amateur hour here with the piss poor service and their bad attitudes and obnoxious patrons. The only reason I came was because a friend likes to stay at the W when visiting and he too noted the quality of this place has declined over the years. He has stayed at four different W locations (NY, South Beach, Westwood) and said this one is the \""worst and trashiest\"". It took an hour before any waitress came over to ask if we wanted any drinks or food. When started to get service it was always a long wait for our pitcher of margaritas or buckets of beer and food. Speaking of the food, the fries, fish tacos and club sandwich are all great. The grilled cheese, not so much. The first $42 pitcher of margaritas was weak, hardly tasting any alcohol. The second pitcher was stronger. To be fair, the Saturday service was much better.\n\nNighttime:\nMuch improved scene, but still not great. There are a lot of out-of-towners since it is a hotel, but still plenty of locals too. I think it's a good mixture. Pants and collared shirts are required, so that usually gets rid of most of the tank top, neck tat wannabes from earlier in the day at the pool.  But really, you are just trading one group of wannabes for another. Man, I'm a hater huh? Oh well, you can handle it. Drinks are overpriced, but this is the W. Be ready to spend lots o' cash.\n\nRooms:\nI've been in a few rooms at this hotel. Each have been nice and clean, but pretty small."
1,"The chicken fried chicken is great and so is the open faced turkey sandwich. They give large portions, and the ranch at the salad bar is one of the best I've tasted... I specifically come back for the open face turkey, chicken fried chicken, and ranch at the salad bar..."
0,Once again my local dominos lets me down. I call the store after according to the website my order left the store over an hour ago and the manager literally laughed when i asked for a refund. Keep my $29 Dominos bc you will never get another dime from me or anyone I know.
1,"Looks are definitely deceiving here.  Doesn't look like much outside, or inside.  Very small and cramped.  They might think about removing the booths to open up the space.  I came on a Monday night, and the place was packed; which says a lot.  I was finally seated, but quickly grew annoyed because it seemed the waiter forgot about me while waiting on others that had sat down after me.  Nevertheless, I finally ordered some chicken panang.  I was in for a feast.  The portion was huge, and I can eat a lot in one sitting!  Very rich with coconut milk and red curry.  I ordered a level 10 spiciness, but it came out as a 2.  Obviously \""white-washed.\""  The flavor was outstanding however.  I think I need to become somewhat of a regular, so they know I'm not messing around when I say, \""make it spicy!\"""
0,"We usually order delivery from here and have enjoyed the food here.  \n\nTonight we decided to opt for take out and have to say the quality and service was terrible. One roll we ordered ended up being served up not as a roll but all of the ingredients being thrown together in a to go container.  The rainbow roll that was ordered consisted of one small piece of salmon and the rest being a single type of whitefish.  \n\nThe woman who took the order evidently was having a difficult night.\n\nOn the plus side, even though the appearance was lacking, the taste was there, especially the Hot and Sour soup."
0,Bug in our food and managers were very noncarrying and very standoffish regarding this
1,"One of my favorite place to shop on State Street. In particular for sunglasses, bags, and other gifts for my friends. (and for myself)  Little Luxuries includes novelty items as well as a nice array of jewelery and well crafted bags and home decorating items. (including a laptop case that I bought 3 years ago and STILL get compliments)  I would describe tihis store as Pop Deluxe with slightly more useful things.. but not THAT much more useful."
0,"Two stars.  Because, I really have had better.  \n\nA group of my foodie friends and I met up here in order to sort out the deets of our upcoming podcast.  The dude who made our reservation made it for four instead of five, so it took us a little while to get a table.  Not that big of a deal to me, especially since said dude bought a bottle of wine for the group to share.  \n\nAt long last we were taken to our table.  Our group nestled in to our cozy booth and perused the menu.  I already knew there wasn't much for me to eat there, as I had checked their menu online.  My cohorts ordered some appetizers: tater tots and deviled eggs.  Both dishes looked good, and everyone seemed pleased.\n\nThe service began to get a little shotty at this point. It took a while to get waters to the table and there weren't any napkins or silverware at the table until we asked for some (after the appetizers were delivered).  Two of my friends ordered appetizer salads/soups which didn't come until the entrees came.  Salad friend ordered with no walnuts, he is allergic, but it came full o' nuts. Soup friend was presented soup and no spoon.  Soup friend also ordered several items and was told that they were out (which I can understand, given that there was a Suns game that night), when plates were dropped at the table servers were VERY quick to disappear, leaving us to literally have to yell after them for the missing stuff/refills. \n\nAs for my meal, I ordered the Citrus Marinated Olives and the Chicory Salad.  I let the server know of my vegan/gluten-freeness and he was helpful and accommodating.  The others seemed divided on their meals.  Lots of meat, that's all I can remember of what they had haha.  Eventually, the manager came to the table to apologize for all of the little mishaps and said a round of drinks was on the house. Fine by me, I thoroughly enjoyed my Tito's gimlet, thank you!  Then the executive Chef came out to apologize as well.  It was a nice touch.\n\nAll in all, I might give them a second try, but with all of the great places out there, Blue Hound might want to step up their game."
1,"I freaking love this place. I am pretty sure I've never eaten sushi for MORE than my money's worth til I got here. It's AYCE sushi for $23 and you can order 3 rolls at a time (which is MORE THAN ENOUGH after about 2 rounds... especially if you go with a huge group and share everything). This restaurant seems to love me because it has nearly all of its roll with my favorite, SPICY TUNA. Many of the rolls kind of tasted the same, but I loved the Mad Dragon, Happy Ending, Snow in Vegas (or something like that).. and basically everything with spicy tuna, crab (not artificial crab!), eel, and/or avocado... YUM. I would go back again and again if I could :(. PLEASE GO TO YAMA SUSHI! They even include dessert in the flat price, with varieties of mochi and ice cream.. Drooooooollllll....\n\nNeedless to say, everything was fresh and incredibly delicious."
0,"I like this place. As a number of other people have mentioned, the chips and salsa are great. The horchata is also delicious and they give you free refills (utter madness but I love it). However, it wasn't the best mexican I've had, not even close to the top 5. For whatever reason, I was craving enchiladas. They did not turn out well. The sauce that came on the enchilada tasted like it was from a can. just terrible. My girlfriend's meal was much better. She had two steak tacos that looked pretty tasty. She really enjoyed  her meal. I'll be back to see if they just misfired on the enchiladas.\n\nUpdate: I came back and ordered the fish tacos. they were not good. won't be back."
0,"Nothing but a place that steals your money.  First, it took so long for a simple order to ship/arrive that the patient died (really).  Trying to get these now-useless items returned was an email and phone nightmare.  The products were eventually picked up and, as of this date (6 months after the return), still no credit.\n\nI used to get dozens of emails and banner ads.  After the sole my money, zip.  This simply indicates we are looking at a deliberate case of consumer fraud/theft.\n\nStay away!"
0,"My husband and I had lunch.  He ordered the Jaeger Schnitzel.  It came out with cold gravy, which also smothered his fries making them cold and soggy.  I had the Pear and Black Forest Ham sandwich.  It was really good, but my fries were ice cold and mostly hard on the ends.  Really, why not cook up fresh fries?  The bar maid was really nice, helpful and friendly.  I tried the darkest beer, at $7.00 for a small, and thought it was too effervescent.   I could not stop burping from the beer.  Not pleasant for lunch.  Probably won't go back."
1,"The best pedicure of my life. Seriously, I wish these girls would.come to California. They are so sweet and friendly. My manicure was great as well. Next time I'm in town I'll be back for sure."
1,"I really like this park,  there is really nothing else like it in the valley. It has some great water features for dogs that like to swim,  and plenty of open areas for them to run and play.   Our dog really loves the doggie play stairs (not sure what to call them,  check out my pic) and socializing with all the other dogs.  Only issue is lack of grass in the common area,  hope they plant more soon."
0,"If you are in Vegas to have a great time, then skip The Marquee Club and head out to one of the other \""upscale\"" clubs.  If you are in Vegas to satisfy some checklist of stuff that you saw on the travel channel or celebrity gossip, then your purpose is obviously different, so proceed...but ye be warned.  Personally, I went in with no expectations but still came out utterly disappointed. \n\nPros:\nPacked with people\nExcellent bottle/table service\nMultiple dance floors with different music genres\nGreat view of the Strip\n\nCons:\nPacked with people\nRude bouncers, door people/security, and management\nVery long lines for everything\n\nI went to The Marquee Club without knowing a thing about it.  We had VIP table reservations, so I figured everything was going to run smoothly, until we got to the Club.  There were nearly 500-600 people waiting in one line and another 300 waiting in another - I thought it was because we were early and the doors weren't open, but it was actually because the Club was already full.  The longer line was for people without table reservations: they let you in when space opens up (slim chance) as \""standing room only\"" for a hundred dollars cover.  The shorter line was for people with table reservations: they have limited number of tables so you have to wait until one opens up, but at least you're guaranteed to get in. \n\nThe club was packed with people - sardine can tight.  It was impossible to find a place to dance on the dance floors, let alone walk through them, and a lot of people ended up dancing in walkways, near the fences, and other odd areas where they could find enough space to move around.  Some people danced near a chain link fence without even getting a sniff of the dance floors.  By the way, there is no place to sit if you don't get a table, and drinks are expensive.  Only when I'm on vacation will I think that spending four thousand dollars on a bunch of bottles is justified - just to have the convenience of couches and an area to dance.\n\nThe best part about the Club was the young lady responsible for taking care of our table.  She poured our drinks, got new chasers for us, flirted with the guys, took a picture with me, was completely pleasant, and looked like a model.  She more than earned her thousand dollar tip because her customer service skills were off the chart.  \n\nThe worst part about the Club, aside from it being completely packed, was the attitude and actions of the door people, bouncers/security, and management.  Considering the amount of money people pay and the expectations they have, you cannot hire thugs with no regard for customer service.  These guys wear suits, but they are little more than bullies on the Club's payroll.  In all my experiences, I have never dealt with a staff that was so rude and blatantly disrespectful to paying customers.  The bartenders are too busy running around getting drinks to even offer a smile... a shame considering the cost of a drink.\n\nI'll list some of my random observations.  There were about 2-3 times as many guys as women.  Most of the people drank before entering the club to save money and hardly any of the guys were trying to buy drinks for the ladies.  Ladies who came in a group, danced in their own group.  There were a lot of guys just dancing by themselves or sneaking up on unsuspecting ladies.  There was nothing \""upscale\"" about the clientele or the club, but you do have a very nice view of the Strip.  The really attractive ladies ignored everyone and sort of walked through the place trying to be seen.  I stuffed bills into a girl's thong after she flashed me and gave me a little dance.  Women relieved themselves in odd corners because of the lines to the restroom.  There are more posers than actual \""ballers\"" but most of the ladies can't tell the difference.\n\nThere was an incident on our exit.  One of the bouncers grabbed a guy in our group and called management on him.  They said that he had to be detained because he was too drunk.  We tried to tell him that we were on our way out, but he refused to listen to us.  Without telling us a thing, they grab him and take him to a backroom.  When the women in our group started asking questions about our friend, their guys actually threatened us and challenged us to fights.  So that you understand, our group was composed of managers on a little team building vacation, not young thugs.  After 10-15 minutes, they report that our friend was too drunk and that we were all being kicked out of the Club.  \n\nYou're only in Vegas for a handful of days, so go to a club where you won't waste your time in lines or have to deal with a less than professional staff.  You will find the same crowd and overpriced drinks at the other upscale clubs but with less fuss and hassle.  If you're ideal club experience involves a sea of posers and the pretentious, then go right ahead.  It really isn't my ideal club environment/vibe, but I have to admit, you will see some crazy stuff at The Marquee Club."
0,"A very mixed bag.  The prices are inflated for merchandise that frequently seems to be \""seconds\"".  There are some great buys, but that's only for items on \""sale\"", and by using one of their 20/40/50% coupons.  Cute home accessories, but again, prices are cheaper for similar stuff at other stores. Big selection of shoes...but way overpriced. Lingerie & costume jewelry selections are plentiful & pricing is good. Salespeople, when they can be found (almost never), are abrupt, bordering on rude (especially the ones who've worked there awhile!).  Cashiers also are not the warmest folks..and seem  unwilling to help."
0,"I gave two for the fountain view , food was horrid, salad wilted lettuce which was brown on edges , waitress recommended Mediterranean grilled vegetables ,added chicken ,dry tasteless broccoli\nUs yellowed , so disappointed. Service was good ,food horrid again."
0,"It is with broken heart that I review Armstrongs poorly. I at one point would have gone through hell and high water to eat here. I went a few weeks back and it was terrible. The dining room was much dirtier than I remember. Our server didn't even take the time to talk with us and walked away before we finished ordering and never checked on us after the runner brought our food. She did however attempt to upsell our check with desert twice. To make it worse I voiced my concern to the manager, he replied with \""everyone has bad experienced sometimes but if you want to hate us for the rest of your life that is your choice\"". Not sure what prompted that response but I will say after walking out that night.... I will not be back."
0,"Want some sort of stringy chewy grey, meatish? looking stuff covered in fake cheesy, oily gravy nastiness with a huge side of gas? .......................Then eat here if you dare.\n\nSerrano's used to be good when they first opened in QC. Oh, for the good old days! They need to seriously redo their recipes........not just make the menu and marketing campaign pretty. EEE  GADS!!!"
1,"I am usually not a great fan of crepes, but the wife is and groupon/living social facilitated yet another venture to a new place. Crispy Crepe is located directly on South Blvd in the Dilworth area. We sat on the patio out front, which made for interesting people watching as well as some road rage incidents.\n\nWe were both starved and each ordered a savory crepe. I went with the Chipolte Chicken and the wife chose the Grilled Marinated Shrimp.  Both crepes were loaded with filling material on top of amazing flavors. We also got some lattes, maple syrup for me and pumpkin spice for the wife. Again, I am not usually a latte fan, but crispy crepe's maple syrup version worked for me. \n\nWhile we were already well fed, we still opted for a dessert, which was my idea and that almost never happens. The maple delight Liege waffle was calling my name as soon as I saw it on the menu. I am sure that it's clear by now that I'm a big fan of anything maple. OMG, I would return for the Liege waffles alone!\n\nService was good, and we will definitely be returning."
1,"Yup, yup...still a fan. Service is still good, but they've definitely improved on my french fry complaint - my fries were hot and burned my mouth. WOO HOO! :)\n\nEverything was as good as I remembered it. I docked a star because part of my brisket was really tough so I didn't eat that part...it has become a reward for my cute little dog Rex. :)\n\nStill 2 thumbs up from me and hubby."
0,"I've been coming here regularly for years.  But my last trip was terrible.  The service was not up to the standards I'd become accustomed too.\n\nCheck in:\n\nThere is absolutely no order to the process.  No indication of a line to check in, so we stand near one of the 3 clerks currently checking people in.  During this ridiculously long wait, a line 7 deep forms behind me.  Now this is over 15 minutes of waiting.  Really should not take that long the check people in.  I understand once in a while there are issues with check in, but when there are 3 at the same time, that's got to be a hotel thing.\n\nAlong with the three clerks, there were two additional people at the front desk, a clerk and a supervisor.  Neither bothered to look up, as if they were purposefully trying to remain unaware of the long line for people forming, waiting and being annoyed.\n\nFinally one of the clerks was finished.  Unfortunately it was the one farthest from me, because a random guest ran up to the desk and needed some sort of assistance.  By the time we got to stand in front of a clerk, it had been 30 minutes.  Only the same 3 clerks working the line with now 10 people behind me, and not moving.  We were done in 5 minutes, but the others two were still working the same people.  As we were headed to the elevator, another clerk came out to help the line move.\n\nThe room:\n\nHousekeeping had neglected a few items.  We were short on our mixed matched which may not bug most, but that bugs me.  How hard it is to ensure that a room has matching towels!?!  The room did not have a 'Do Not Disturb' sign, which caused a bit of an issue, when housekeeping decided to come barging into the room.  Luckily, we were only unwinding from the drive and long stand in line.\n\nI like little conveniences like room service breakfast.  This allows me to sleep in, and wake up to breakfast.  Typically, they have a door hangtag which allows us to check what we want and hang it on the door.  Someone comes by around 2 AM, a cart with breakfast at my designated time.  There was also no room service menu.  We did have free internet, which was a plus.\n\nLet's talk privacy. ABSOLUTELY NONE.  I don't remember the walls being so thin, but I guess I spent more time in my room then on a typical trip.  I don't need to hear my neighbors and they don't need to hear me.  I could hear both ends of a disturbing cell phone conversation going on outside my room.\n\nRoom Service Breakfast:\n\nBefore we left for Dinner we swung by the front desk to have housekeeping go back and properly prepare our room, and leave us a 'Do Not Disturb' sign and a Breakfast Hang Tag.  We got the sign and a Room Service Menu.  Close enough.  Got up a little early to order breakfast.  Boyfriend got bacon, eggs, and hash browns.  Easy nothing to mess up.  The Butter was even molded to match the logo, cute.  I got CHEWY Belgian Waffles and fresh fruit.  I don't think I need to say anymore about that.  \n\nDrift Spa: \n\nI wanted a massage, so I called the Drift Spa during business hours and got a recording.  I left a message as requested and no call back in over 90 minutes.  I call back, and again, no answer.  We finally go out to dinner and when we return, there is no message from the Spa.  I decide that an incompetent front desk I can over look, so I can judge the spa for its services.  The next morning, I call and schedule a couples Shiatsu Massage.  We were happy enough with the massage, but the Deep Tissue was the way to go.  If you are considering services at the spa, they bill in a non-negotiable 20% tip for the service providers.  I don't think this unreasonable, since there is the person who keeps the facilities stocked and fresh, and bring you slippers, in addition to the masseur.\n\nCheck Out:\n\nWe were originally planning to do video check out, because that's a nice convenience.  However, upon review of the bill, there was a random $65 charge attached to the room.  We went over everything we charged to the room and could not account for this $65 dollars.  So we headed down to the front desk.  Same mess as check in.  Disorderly blob of people. Had to figure out where and if there was a line, and naturally the inconsiderate folks who walk up first got served first. (I'd remember this for next time so I could be a bit more aggressive, but I think after 7+ years, and seeing this type of degradation, I'm going to take my meager business to one of the many other hotels in Vegas.)\n\nI digress, we get to a clerk, coincidentally the same one who checked us in, and he pulls the bill.  The $65 was for the 'FREE' Internet.  Who knew that FREE = $65, especially considering internet charges in the past was $12.99 for 24-hour access.  Clerk made a phone call and fixed this up for us.\n\nGaming:\n\nMostly slots, few gaming tables, even less open, poker room blows.\n\nAll in all, I'd say the worst experience I've had in the 7+ years I've been going to Palms. Bad enough to end the relationship, as far as I'm concerned."
1,"Dear God,\n\nThank you for letting La Bamba be a thing. I don't know how many times I've needed a super burrito with steak to kill a nasty post football game or Dells hangover. Thank you for allowing the staff to be kind enough not to judge my friends and I today for being so sunburned we couldn't move.  Thank you for letting them serve the best hot sauce on earth. Thank you for somehow rigging things so I had to stay at the shitty Best Western across the street for a week while working in Madison. I don't hold the 10 pounds I gained eating here every night against you. \n\n              Good luck with heaven and stuff,\n                                     Kyle K\n\nP.S.

1,"New owners within the last few months have brought this place back to a top hot spot for me. The owner is very nice and up forth with his future plans for the establishment. Currently updated is the paint, carpet, small reorganization of the under 1 area, and additional slide to the \""jail\"" area. He has plans to renovate the other half of the building including the cafe. \n\nMy little one loves it here. We enjoyed bringing our lunch in and playing afterwards. The rate has stayed consistant at 9$ and memberships or packages are still avaliable!"
0,"Sorry, but this place was super disappointing! We spent a good couple of hours round trip checking this place out and I would not do it again. I was not expecting to see any of the TV personalities, but I was expecting this place to have some interesting items to peruse.  This was not the case, the shop is fairly run down and dirty. The best kept, largest section was the \""Pawn Stars\""  merchandise section that for some reason dosen't show up on the TV show! I would not seek this place out or wait in-line if you are looking for anything more than a tour of where the TV show is shot!"
1,"On an afternoon in late May, espresso a mano is the picture of how coffee shops should  feel. The glass garage door entrance is open to the sunshine and subtle outdoor air, and the brick interior feels cozy and welcoming. The line at the counter is slightly confusing (it curls away from the door) so I stood in the wrong place as I waited for my order. However, the barista kept a mental track of where I was in line, so once I realized my mistake I did not have to go to the back of the line. The coffee is excellent, but I am not a connoisseur so I'm afraid I cannot say more than that. I got a latte, and it was served to the brim in a white mug with a tiny spoon. I also got a cookie, and while good, it was a bit dry.\nI came in with a computer, and all around the wall are outlets. If everyone at the coffee shop had a computer that needed power they might run out of space, but every table is near an outlet, and I had no trouble finding one. It should be noted, every table had people sitting, and about 3/4 have laptops. I can still see open outlets, so I wouldn't worry about not finding power. There is wifi here, but I'm having trouble accessing it. When the line runs down I'll ask the barista, and we'll see how that goes.\nIf you are sitting and observing, you'll notice how many regulars come in here. About every other person seems to know the baristas, and they are friendly and professional. The line keeps moving, and its clear that the people enjoy the staff as much as the coffee. \nI could describe the art on the walls, and describe the music playing, but at this point I think its just better that you pay a visit and see for yourself, don't you think?\n(extra note: Ignore the whole wifi thing...I was clicking on the wrong network. Whoops!)"
0,Arrived at 9:30pm the place was 90% empty but we still waited almost 15 minutes before a server even asked us what we would like to drink.   I had always avoided Joes but it was the only place open so we gave it a chance.  Slow service mediocre to lousy food.  Need I say more?  Will not be back.
1,"After hearing soooo many glowing reviews about this place, I decided to give it a try.  This place definitely lived up to the hype; donuts were super fresh and yummy.  Half a dozen of donuts cost around $9.00 but it was worth it.  My favorite was the chocolate bar, perfect balance of chocolate and dough. Cashier was very friendly and patient.  I will definitely be back."
0,"Is it possible to give \""zero\"" stars?\n\nI've been in there twice and the employees were rude, both times.  I'm not the \""Scottsdale Elite\"", but seriously... I'm a paying customer too.  The little boy who said he was the manager was rude too."
1,Delicious and great service. Got a protein burger. Was a little messy but to be expected when there's no bun. Lol milkshake also delicious and recommended.
0,Legendarily lame.\n\nThis place has managed to successfully wage a campaign against fun for more than a decade. Tactics include: carefully measuring out each shot with a measuring cup while making mixed drinks and charging four dollars above market price for shitty food.\n\nGoing to legends is like having the hot water cut out in the middle of a shower. \nIt's like getting your scrotum caught while zipping up your fly. \nIt's like watching Schindler's List during a bachelor party. \nIt's like clogging the toilet at your girlfriend's parent's house. \n\nNot fun at all.
1,"This is my favorite breakfast joint...why?  Because I love corn beef hash and this place has the best corn beef hash I have ever tasted!\n\nIf you are a huge fan of corn beef hash, then you will LOVE this breakfast place as well.  There were chunks and chunks of corn beef with potatoes.  I got the meal so it included the potato spuds (these are thicker home-made potato chips) and the homemade pumpkin spiced cake.  Everything was sooooo delicious.  This was a huge portion.  I took half of my food to-go and ate it for a late lunch and still tasted as delicious as during breakfast.\n\nToo bad they didn't have rice...I wonder if I can bring my own rice and just order a side of corn beef hash (pondering...nah).  Oh how much I love delicious corn beef hash over rice.  nom nom nom\n\nI repeat, this is the best corn beef hash I have ever tasted..."
0,"There were six employees behind the counter and one customer waiting for their sandwich to be made, and I was the only person in line and couldn't get a single person to take my order.  Walked out and got faster service at Panera, which had a line out the door.\n\nOh well."
0,"I would give this place 0 stars if it was available. I went  there for a basic oil change trying to use their coupon that is mailed to me. Now, take in mind i have come in here two times before with the same car and have never had a problem.  This time, i am told they will not honor the coupon because their computer shows my 99 Mercury Sable with 150k requires synthetic oil and i need to upgrade. Doesnt matter when i tell them i have reciepts from my last changes at THEIR shop and have never put synthetic in this car since new and it still runs fabulous. I even offered to pull the owners manual and show them it says nothing in it about requiring synthetic oil. They refused to listen and basically thru me out. This place is a joke and sucks horribly. Thank God for Tire Works down the street. Went in and they honored the coupon and had me in and out in 20 minutes."
1,"Good place for seafood restaurant. You go there and choose what are you like and then they cook for you with some spices.\n\nPlace look good, I went there with my girlfriend. They give good portion of side dishes too like potato or rice.\n\nI ordered a grilled fish, and I liked it pretty good. My girlfriend ordered grilled salmon and also not bad.\n\nIf you are a seafood lover, you should try this place. \n\nTheir seafood look fresh ok when you order."
1,I don't know about the best pizza I've ever eaten part. For fast good for your kids type of pizza that you have to bake yourself. I would have to say its pretty decent. They run a clean operation in the two different locations that I have been in.
0,"You have got to be fucking kidding me. \nThere was no one in the restaurant. the place was a graveyard, yet no one thought it was important to wipe the tables or even sweep the floor. Crumbs and sticky stains everywhere. i ordered take-out before I got a good look at the place. While I waited for my order I looked around for a place to sit - no clean chairs. All had crumbs on them. Tables had folded-up pieces of cardboard shoved underneath the legs, balancing them out. One table had THREE cardboard balancers. All the chairs have chipped paint. There are stacks of sodas with a stained apron tossed onto the top of them - better wipe those bitches down good before you slurp, people!! The license on the wall reads 2008. HOLY GOD THIS IS 2010!\nThere is a BED that's not even hidden from view. Toothbrush and toothpaste and a shoerack! Damn, put that in the BACK ROOM not the FRONT if you so desperately need to do it. And give me a break - how busy can this place possibly get, that you need to sleep there overnight??? I shudder to think what the back kitchen looks like if they can't even pretend to make the dining area presentable. \nEven my dog wouldnt eat there... but since he's missing a leg, he might need to steer clear of this place before they try to stew him up. BTW I AM ASIAN so keep the racist accusations to yourselves, white weirdos. \nOkay, all joking aside: the place is GODDAMN DIRTY. PERIOD."
1,"Great park with open spaces, softball fields, basketball courts, and sand volleyball courts in addition to the tennis center. I walk here almost every day when visiting Scottsdale."
0,"I used to come here all the time and I made sure I always made it here when I came to Las Vegas. However, on my most recent visit, the food was just not good. The pastas were bland and the crepes were only as good as one you can get at ihop. On a brighter note, the coq au vin was quite good as well as the prime rib. I probably won't come back as there are so many better buffet options here."
1,"Really good pizza. Not the best in the world, and it can be a little pricey. But it's nice to chill here with friends, have a beer, and go next door to smoke hookah. They also sell pipes and smoking paraphernalia. If you are bored on a sunday night it's a nice place to hang.\nPS: *Beware the tweekers that like to haunt around the parking lot at night* But then again, that's all of Phoenix, right?"
0,"I used to love going to TGI Fridays, because they used to have the menu where it was 2 courses for \u00a39.95. My friends and I used to go for birthdays and the staff are always great and you'd never have any complaints because you knew exactly what you were getting.\n\nHowever, there seems to be some kind of East/West discrepancy. TGI Fridays in Glasgow would get bstars, or maybe even flour, but TGIs in Edinburgh is lucky to be getting two stars.\n\nThe staff were great, but I had mixed up the booking and had booked the table for a day later than required, but they sorted us out. It took us ages to pick from the menu, I ordered buffalo wings. I love buffalo wings. I do. They're my favourite ever thing from TGIs but in Edinburgh...THEY DON'T PUT SAUCE ON THEM. I was traumatised. I was unsatisfied. \n\nI ordered a chicken burger next and found it unbearably salty. I don't usually have TGIs burgers, and I don't think I will again if they're this salty. \n\nMy boyfriend shared his Oreo sundae with me and that was really good, so that's why I'm giving this place two stars."
1,"I've been a member of this gym for a couple years now and I think it's great. For the record, I only go to the gym for classes - I don't use exercise equipment, lift weights, or play raquetball. Once in a very long while, I'll get myself into the pool.\n\nMy opinion is that their classes are wonderful. The ones I want to take (Zumba and Kickboxing) are offered right after work. They offer a lot of BodyPump too - if that's your thing. All the instructors are super nice and enthusiastic. The locker rooms are always clean and tidy.\n\nThe pool is small - three lanes, not quite 25 yards and shallow. But it's fine for swimming laps, you just have to do the distance calculation appropriately.\n\nParking is usually good in the warmer months. Gets to be a little bit of a pain in the winter, but that's probably true of all gyms in Wisconsin."
0,"Jaipur is definitely a hit or miss kind of joint. They do lack consistency in quality, flavor, spice distribution and amount of food given.\n\nToday the order came out completely wrong and had to be redone. The shrimp tikka masala was made of rubbery chewy farmed fish and the medium heat was non existent. There was no spice involved. The tikka masala had no cream consistency to it today. It was very runny and overpoweringly tomato based. \n\nThe first experience I had merited 3 stars, the second time I ate there they qualified for 3.5 stars, and this last time they really went down to 1 star. I'm averaging them out at 2 stars after three tries.\n\nI've exhausted my attempts. The inconsistency is too great and for the price they shouldn't be lacking at all. I will not eat here again."
1,"I really enjoyed this place a lot.  Excellent quality food, remarkable service and while the prices were definitely Vegas-style (read: higher than usual) I still feel like I got my money's worth.\n\nAtmosphere is nice, up-scale, and very open.  You get a nice little view of the kitchen without it being a spectacle.  As I said the service was excellent.  The sommelier was friendly and helpful, and just added to the experience.  Our waiter was attentive, friendly, sociable and just helped make the meal that much better.\n\nThey start things off with some french fries that are cooked in duck fat.  They were light, crispy and very tasty.  You get three varieties which I believe were garlic herb, truffle and chipotle each paired with dipping sauces.  It's nice to see a restaurant take something simple and class it up a bit.\n\nFor an appetizer I had the bacon-wrapped lobster fritters.  I already knew that bacon makes everything taste better but I didn't know it could make lobster taste that much better.\n\nMy date had the spinach souffle with parmesan cream which she absolutely loved.  I had the bone-in rib-eye which was absolutely excellent.  The steaks here a first poached in butter and then cooked over a wood-burning grill.  I hadn't had steak prepared in this manner before but it was excellent, one of the more memorable steaks I've ever had.\n\nBig thumbs up for this place."
0,Prices not great for true thrifters. Staff completely useless. No dressing rooms. I simply have nothing to say about this place.
0,"I use to be a huge fan of the Red Velvet Cafe but that has changed. I went with a group of friends and of the six of us, no one but myself enjoyed their meal. However, 16 bucks for vegetarian tacos is ridiculous. It feels like the passion for good food with great ingredients, at a reasonable price has long since gone away."
0,Manager's. Coach your employees which window is what. When a customer is pulling up. The first window is #1 to us not #2. There's no signs. They need to listen and pay attention. This is the 2nd huge mishap. #1. this job isn't that hard. Horrible!!!!
1,"Cool little place I discovered while I was opening an account at PNC Bank that is across the street. Food is really good and the prices are unbeatable. The panini's are great and the wraps are not half bad either. I got way more than what I paid for and felt like it was a great value.\n\nI spoke with the owner who was behind the counter and he seems like a very nice guy. The guy in front of me in line apparently had his order messed up and the owner was kind enough to fix it and give it to him free of charge. Cool little local place and a great way to support local businesses. \n\nThey have no seating. The owner told me when he bought the building, the Crazy Mocha coffee shop that is next door bought the bathrooms so because of health codes, he is not allowed to have seating. TAKE OUT ONLY!!"
0,"I think this place is a little deceiving. Based on the interior of the casino and the price of its restaurants, they want you to believe the hotel is fancier than it actually is. The only real kudos I can give the Monte Carlo is its location on the strip, proximity to other casinos, and their fitness center (see below).\n\nThe room was ok. No luxury, just the nuts and bolts of a standard room. The Monte Carlo offers very cheap deals during weekdays, but note they do charge a MANDATORY resort fee daily. I believe the fee is about $15 and includes high speed internet (but not wi fi...crazy!!!!!) and access to the gym (but not the spa). These were the only two amenities I used during the visit. I had my laptop and had to use a plug-in cord, which did not work very well. The Internet kept cutting in and out...very annoying. The gym was a pleasant surprise; it had nice equipment and it was not overly crowded. \n\nWould I stay here again? Probably not, in a town that prides itself on exceptional hotel quality (ie, the Palazzo), I will continue looking for deals and pay a little more to stay at nicer hotels. Some might say, \""why spend so much $$ on a hotel room in Vegas that you won't spend much time in?\"" My rebuttal is that I am on vacation and want to be pampered. To each their own."
1,"This is a great little burger joint! The food is really really good, I fancy the jalepeno burger but I have tried the Haven Burger and you cant go wrong there either. The atmosphere is fun and the owner is always helpful and friendly, he takes the time to chat here at there too. The food it very fresh tasting, I would definitely recommend the onion rings, and their zucchini fries. I have yet to try one of their burritos or something off their breakfast menu, I hope to do that soon!"
0,"Horrible customer service,  cashier must have had a bad day. Talked ugly to customers.   Not returning to this Starbucks.   First time I had service like this."
1,"my wife and i are extremely picky about japanese food--it's our favorite cuisine.  we have eaten sushi, teppan, and robata from san francisco to tokyo.  En is as good as it gets.  and how lucky are we that it's the closest japanese restaurant to our house?!  unlike the very racist reviewer below who basically said that a korean run place can't make good sushi, we don't care WHO makes the food as long as it's GOOD.  and this place is FANTASTIC.  our kids love it, and we love it.  their fish is fresh--surprise surprise, that happens to be important--unlike the ethnicity of the sushi chef.  the tofu is HOMEMADE--if you like agedashi tofu, En's homemade version is a delight.  not many places serve robata grill food and en's is excellent.  the service is very friendly and we've become such regulars that the wait staff know exactly what our kids order every single time.  when we leave for vacation we always look forward to coming back home and having a meal at en.  \n\nA good meal is a good meal and friendly service is friendly service.  Our favorite japanese restaurant in the world happens to be in henderson, NV.  nothing wrong with that food snobs!"
0,"Yesterday 3/18/2014 we went to 2007 Nails. The shop was unusually busy I thought, with more than 4 people waiting. We had 4 pedicures and 2 full sets. I got my nails done with a guy who didn't tell me his name. He did not put a top coat or offer to put gel top coat on my White tips. I had to wait for a free pedicure chair. Which I really didn't mind. \n\nMy mom sat down with Cindy to get the same style of tips I got, white tips with clear acrylic overlay. First thing off the bat, Cindy used the drill and nicked the skin on my mom's pinky on the left hand, then my mom had to ask her to use antiseptic liquid on the wound? (Cindy should have taken the initiative to do this?) As Cindy started my mom's full set she proceeded to glue the tip to the skin of my mom's other pinky. My mom said that the tip was glued to her skin and Cindy pitched a fit, yelling in Vietnamese and then took off the tip. She said \""You not happy, I not do your nails\"".  How can anyone be happy with a tip glued to them? An open wound created by the nail technician? \n\nI opted not to get my pedicure, because of this unkind act by the nail technician. It's not my mom's fault the glue ran under the tip and adhered to her skin. My mom is a senior 73 years old and she was treated like dirt in this salon. \n\nIt's quite obvious Cindy was already out of sorts before she started on my mom. I am at a loss to this type of behavior. Non-seasonal customers like us, make sure your business stays operating. However, we will not come back.  \n\nFacility: Is nicely kept, there is refreshments for you, if you so wish. (They need to dust the cobwebs off the front glass at the top by the ceiling). \n\nPrice: Out of sight for a basic pedicure!"
1,"Decided to finally give this place a try since it was one of the restaurant week locations and it did not disappoint! \n\nOld school restaurant feel and seating is a little strange, but I guess it works....they pull out the tables and you sit next to each in a booth at least if there's a small party.  The service is attentive and the waitress was extremely friendly.  The ambiance is nice, but has the typical Vegas feel when it comes to how dressy you need to be...some people were definitely dressed well, while others were in jeans and tank tops...\n\nThe meal starts with the signature spinning salad...given the fact I abhor salads...this one was actually pretty tasty! Next the prime rib cart with the sides comes over and you can select how you prefer your cut of prime rib and the sides offered are fatty heaven as well.  We selected the creamed corn and creamed spinach.  The creamed corn was a little too sweet for my liking, but the creamed spinach was delicious with little pieces of bacon mixed in.  The meal also comes with mashed potatoes and yorkshire pudding (an eggy/bread mixture).  Portions are more than generous and you leave anticipating the food coma to hit!\n\nAlthough I paid the pre-fixed price, perusing the menu....the prices on the normal menu seemed quite reasonable considering their large portion sizes!  Will definitely recommend this place to any friends looking for some good prime rib!"
1,Great people and even better food!
0,"I will not be caught in this place alone ordering past 8 pm. The strip mall where it's located is a bit dubious. The restaurant itself is dark and dingy. Their salsa station always looks messy.Talking to the cashier on night shift is like talking to a robot. No attempt at customer service whatsoever. There are so many things they can improve upon. \n\nIt's a shame because their tacos are decent with enough flavor and spices to hit the spot. This place is also open 24/7! From where I live, this is closer than having to venture out to downtown/strip to Tacos El Gordo. So if I have a taco craving, Roberto's can *sometimes* suffice, especially when pressed for time. I just order their adobada, carne asada, and fish tacos."
1,"I haven't ran more than 2 miles sine high school, back when I was in track & field, but now I'm a bit older and a bit more financially stable that I could invest in a decent pair of running shoes. \n\nComing into Performance Footwear I knew that the prices I would be paying would definitely be more than what it cost at Amazon, Zappos, and maybe even Sport Chalet, but you know what.. I like to support the smaller businesses even if its going to cost a bit more. \n\nTom (the owner I think), was pretty friendly, had me run on the treadmill to look at my running patterns, my foot's pronation, etc. Had me try on a couple pairs of shoes based on that and my uber flat feet and adjusted to what felt most comfortable. Had me looking at the Asics Nimbus, but woo that was a bit over my price range and I told him that, so we adjusted and he special ordered a pair of Asics Cumulus in a 2E width. Remember to use the Yelp Deal it saved me a bit. \n\nOverall I was pretty satisfied with my purchase and the owner's knowledge was definitely superior to some guy at Sport Chalet who works on a hourly wage. Only gripe is that my order was 2-3 days over what day he told me to come in and pick them up. Not immediately their fault as shipping can take a while.. but it would be nice to get a call to let me know they're going to take a bit longer."
0,I received a massage from Touch of Healing as a Xmas present. I decided to use it last week and I am glad that I didn't pay for it myself. My massage therapist Thomas had ice cold hands for about half of the massage. It was very hard to relax due to this. Also during the last half of my massage I heard a big thud on the door which startled me and someone pushing paper under the door. That took me out of the relaxed state that I just got into. I then heard my door open and the massage therapist pull keys out of his pocket and give them to someone. It was the most unrelaxed massage I have received.  :-(\n\nUPDATE: I received an email from Thomas offering me a free 30 minute massage BUT I could upgrade to an hour for $25.... I don't think so. The email seemed pretty unprofessional and he added that him disrupting the massage was for the best. This email was a little creepy at parts and unprofessional to say the least.
0,"I would expect at least a good tasted coffee from a place named \""coffee trader\"" but their iced coffee drinks tasted yuk, not even meeting the average expectation. Mine was a sweet one (Iced Mocha) and I could manage to finish it. My wife's was not sweet (Iced Coffee) and she threw it away after sipping a couple of times. I am usually reluctant to throw food/drink away and so I tried to take over hers. But I agreed with her after sipping once. The coffee (probably only iced ones) had a strange disgusting smell and taste. I tried this place and Bradbury's Coffee on the same day. Bradbury's was way better. Not even comparable.\n\nProbably they focus more on selling wines?"
0,"Love the food always have but the attitude this girl has Diana needs to change, I asked if they still had bowls and you know what she said to me! She said \""yea no shit we do\"" and rolled her eye's at me. Even the mext guest she took care of said she should smile more and she gave him attitude also. So if you come and she is here short young girl, will probably be on her phone, be prepared for some attitude.  MANAGEMENT PLEASE RETRAIN HER OR FIRE HER, she is definitely ruining the l&l brand."
1,Best breakfast place ever! It is always crowded here though so you might have to wait but it is worth it. It's an old school western cafe with a very kitschy decor and that just adds to the appeal. They are famous for their pies but I love the breakfast. Omelettes are delicious and the chicken fried steak is perfectly seasoned and crisp. Oh - and finally a place that knows how to baste an egg! Staff is friendly and efficient. If you are in need of some good grub this is your place!
1,"It was actually better than I expected, great Mac&chesse, yams, and fried chicken!!! I only wish the hot bar was more like a buffet, other then that great soul food!!!"
1,"We had my sister's bachelorette party in Vegas and I wanted cupcakes for her dinner party.  Found this place and decided to call them.  The gal was very friendly and I ended up placing an order online for the Better than sex and Chocolate Wasted. \n\nCool thing is, they deliver!  I wanted the cupcakes to look kind of raunchy and they were able to accommodate that with an extra fee.  The cupcakes were a hit with the gals.  The penis sprinkles were cute and the cupcakes were delivered to our restaurant on time."
0,"No cars available when we arrived, even though had reservation for 8 months!!! Staff rude and not accomdating, asked how could you not have cars available there counter Lady replied with a smart remark basically saying so what, I will NEVER rent from Hertz again, first time I ever used them and definitely the last, DO NOT RENT FROM HERE!"
1,"WOW! \n\nthe bf and i had made reservations here before we were off to watch jersey boys, and everything from start to finish was fabulous. We were seated right away with delicious, fresh, warm, bread to snack on before our meal. coming in I knew i wanted steak, so i ordered the \""classique\"" since it's always better to be safe the first time, right? the steak is large but thin at the same time. the BUTTER on top omg, i don't think i've ever had steak like that before. it was goddamn mouthwatering. hats off to the chef for cooking it a perfect medium rare too. and the fries, wow. I am NOT a french fries person, but i ended up inhaling these thin, oddly cut fries. \n\nthe restaurant is gorgeous on top of the great service. I had requested to be seated on the patio, but because it's so cold these days it was covered up. No worries, the view of the bellagio foundation always looks good. \n\ni will DEFINITELY be back next time i'm in town."
1,Music is an integral part of my life.  If I don't go to at least 2 concerts every month I start to go through withdrawals. I'm a much bigger fan of smaller venues than massive sized arenas.  When the venue is smaller the entire concert experience is enhanced because it's more intimate and you're closer to the artist.  \n\nNeighborhood Theatre can seat a few hundred with mezzanine seating at stage right and floor seating facing the stage. The sound is great and spot on.  You can easily hear every note that is played or sung.  The only drawback is that the space is a bit dated and could use a few modern touches.  Other than the decor I think this place is awesome and will definitely be back for more concerts or events.
1,Yep...definitely coming back here.  Kelly our waitress was such a sweet woman. Got our Cheesy Cheesesteak Club card. :-)
1,Neat discovery!  Adorable and unique clothes and lots of Michael Stars tops.  They also have a lot of very reasonably priced cute jewelry.  The name is pretty misleading because the clothing they sell is really not exercise wear it is more for being out and about.  The woman who works here was very nice too.
1,"HOW CAN I FORGET TO REVIEW XS LAS VEGAS OH MY GOD.\n\nI went to Vegas back in August of this year and it was absolutely the best time of my life! My friends and I went to XS on a Monday night for \""Dim Mak\"" Mondays to see of course, the one and only Steve Aoki! It was hands down, the best time in a nightclub I had in awhile. I'm from NYC and saying this means A LOT. You know NYC has a lot of great clubs and such but nothing, NOTHING compared to XS. We had free champagne thanks to Aoki's performance and of course some free cake! (Aoki fans know what I'm talking about!) \n\nAdmission for ladies was free of course, especially if you know a promoter. The ratio thing is a really big deal, and I don't blame promoters for asking for a lot of girls because a room full of dudes could get kinda weird. My guy friends paid $20 to get in, probably better than some guys who didn't have any promoter buddies and ended up paying up $40-$60 .. just to get in. So get a promoter, boys and a lot of girlies. The more girls, the easier guys can get in for a cheap price or even free! \n\nNext time I'm in vegas, I will be coming back! The people are sexy, the DJs are crazy and drinks get you drunk. I really need to stay at the Encore or Wynn to make it much easier to get back to the hotel room after experiencing XS. \n\nExpect to spend a lot, it is VEGAS. Get ready people for the best time of your LIFE!"
0,The pizza was ok.... Dinner salad was still defrosting and came after our pizza & deep fried mushrooms... They seemed to be overstaffed with romper room rejects! The mgr should cut staff & maybe pay a dollar or two more an hour to hire people who have reached puberty.
0,I really enjoyed shopping here until yesterday.  Everyone is always helpful all over the store and even at check out when they thank you by name.\n\nI was picking up some Ranger IPA on my way home and Serena was at the check out counter.  She was a bitch.\n\nI'd rather go to Fry's on Indian School or drive further to Whole Foods for specialty items.  I'm not going to this Safeway again.
1,"This Marriott is in a prime location. Just a few blocks from the nightlife section near ASU. Although it is very close to the entertainment, surprisingly it is a quite place. The desk was very helpful. The beds are super comfortable. The price was much better than the others that double the price for the same location."
0,"Worst Buffet ever! \nNever again. \nQuality sucks, Service Too!"
0,"TERRIBLE SERVICE!!!  Wow, I had wanted to come here since they opened finally came with a party of 6 and was so disappointed!  We had a cocktail at the bar which was lovely and then moved to our table.  The waitress mentioned the specials were already sold out by 8pm which was disappointing as I was hoping to have their scallops, however that happens.  When we asked this short dark haired waitress to recommend some other dishes she struggle having the manager step in to assist her.  We all ordered based on the managers recommendations which were ok.  I started with a glass of viognier, the tomato salad and the crispy skate grenobloise as my entree.  The salad was fabulous, the wine delicious and the skate was a very dry disappointment.  My husband ordered the macaroni & cheese gratin\u00e9e and braised beef cheek.  Four of the people in our party ordered the braised beef cheek served medium to medium rare all were served well done (beef jerky style).  On top of this the macaroni & cheese gratin\u00e9e was never delivered to our table.  We asked the food runner for it and he agreed but we never saw him or our waitress the rest of the meal.  Not even to follow up on how our food was or if we needed more cocktails.  We finally saw our waitress when she deliver the check.  We explained to her we never received the macaroni & cheese gratin\u00e9e and she didn't seem to care.  The bill still had the macaroni & cheese gratin\u00e9e billed on it and we asked to have it removed.  She brought it back a second time with it still on their and we asked a third time to finally have it removed.  I have always left 20% to 30% gratitude for food servers and at this restaurant it was additionally added due to a party of six.  If possible I would have left this waitress $0 tip as this was my worst service experience."
0,"Poor guys, had a person leave their shop today and left one service tech in the service bay. On a Sunday when all the other Big O's around me where closed. I've been waiting almost 2 hours for a tire rotation. Enough said...\n\n\nUpdate July 23- I talked to a manager after a brake quote of $340 after 2 and a half hour wait. I wondered why so much after I just needed my pads in the back replaced and only paid 156 and some change. So the manager was rude at the end of our conversation and will be reported to BBB. BE AWARE OF THIS PLACE. They are independently owned and think they can get away with this."
0,"Good food. And very big portions. But too pricey. I had the chicken fajita and it was definitely enough for two, but $16 plus tip for lunch is way too much for Mexican. They also charge the same as other places for sodas, but do not have refills. They give you the can (but they didn't have my preferred Zero even though they had coke products). Get a lunch menu!"
1,"What ever happened to no-nonsense barber shops?  \nThanks to a little Yelp from my friends, I found this spot for a quick haircut on my way to work.\n\nSimple old-school spot.  Nothing fancy.  Just a few old guys giving straight up hair cuts for a reasonable price.\n\nWhat I liked the most is that they still break out a little hot shaving cream and the straight razor to clean up the neck and edges.  Then a little hot towel, and off you go!\n\nGotta love preservation of the art!"
1,The best steak I have had in years. Cooked to a perfect medium rare. Salad was crisp with a tangy blue cheese dressing. The waiter forgot my milk.
0,"DO NOT RENT FROM THEM!!!\n\nLike a comment above, the reduced rate is not worth the horrible service.\n\nWe were in town for a memorial for my father who dies in January. We had 7 people and HAD to have a van that fit two car seats and lots of luggage, so naturally I reserved a van three weeks prior to our arrival. When we came to the desk to retrieve our car we were told there were NONE available. The attendant did make the effort to try to find a car from other rental companies that they share with. An hour later he found a Yukon with 8 seats, but barely any luggage room. He said we could have it for $20 more per day. WHAT???? You charge me more for a car we barely fit in because you were supposed to have available for me to rent. \nTwo hours later, after speaking back and forth with the manager, whom wouldn't even have the courage to speak to us directly, we end up paying an additional $70 for the four days rental.\nWe squashed in the car and left. We return the car today. Hopefully we won't be hassled when we check it in."
1,"I almost consider Las Vegas/Henderson my second home, not because I party in Vegas every other month. My last weekend in Vegas was my second visit for non-family related purposes. Maybe it's because I didn't stay in the standard rooms, or maybe it's because we got a free upgrade to a room with a view... I enjoyed my stay - two queen beds for all two of us. I especially liked that we were center to all locations. We could have walked to Aria, but were misinformed and took a 5 minute cab ride across the street instead. \n\nI did not find spots at the ends of my comforter, and no, I am not an extreme germaphobe but I am so frightened of floral bed linens, and feeling dirty that I decided to pay extra to get a nicer room. I also didn't have any problem with the shower curtain. Oh, wait... we didn't have a shower curtain, we had a separate shower with glass doors. If you're particular like I am, it would be good to consider paying a little extra for better accomodations. I plan to stay here again when I come back with friends."
0,"WORST SUSHI IN THE VALLEY! I have been eating there for 3yrs, but these last few months have been very disappointing, the fish was tasting old, the nigiri looked horrible, like if bought at a cheap supermarket lacking color, but I've put up with it. Last night I went again and they no longer have happy hour and the prices went up! I was puzzled! But again I just went with it, but when my order came, the avocado was BROWN (i uploaded a pic on here)!!!!! The rice tasted OLD! The cucumber was HARD! I was so upset, I asked for the check, paid, and went directly to the owner/chef who makes the sushi and ripped him a new one! He had this face like hes heard it before, which made me even more upset. It was a sad day, I use to LOVE that place! (shaking my head)"
0,In 18 years of sushi eating Ra is 1 of 2 places I have ever sent something back.  Review complete.
0,"I ate here and was rushed in and out like I was in some fast food joint. Our server made up their mind that we were not big tippers (ageist, much?) and treated us accordingly to their wrong assumption. The food was okay but not worth the price or hype. I loved the decor and ambiance. My drink left something to be desired, as well. Will not be returning to any of this chain's locations. Not well played, sir!"
1,Great family owned business. Great food. Love this place. They are cash only and honestly I LOVE that too.
0,"I went here for a smog since I saw a $9.99 coupon.  Who doesn't like to save money?  A few cars were being serviced. I sat down at 2:45 pm and thought it wouldn't take that long since it's only a smog.  15 minutes later, I see the old man who helped me at the counter pull out something from my car.  I didn't know why he would do that since I only wanted a smog.  He called me outside to show me my air filter.  He said it was really dirty which it didn't look very dirty at all.  He said it's been years (2008 is what he said) since it's been changed and he thought that was odd since they should always change it during an oil change.  He said do you want it changed? I said I guess.. which I wasn't too sure about.  \n\n8 minutes passed by and I was getting mad that my smog STILL wasn't done.  I went outside to find the old man.  I said What is taking so long?  I don't want my air filter changed.  I knew he was just trying to get more money out of me.  Everybody has heard of these shady places.  I just want my smog done!  He was on the phone and said I'll just cancel the air filter then.\n\nI went inside and he came to the counter.  He said I just thought you should get your air filter done, so you don't stall.  I told him I just wanted a smog done and it doesn't take that long.  You're just trying to get more money out of me.  He said Smogs are not our priority.  So, if I had 13 cars waiting to be serviced, you would have to wait.  I told him that was rude.  A smog takes 10-20 minutes to do and wouldn't take that much time away from servicing a car.  After I paid my $9.99, he said you should find a new place to get a smog.  Like I would EVER consider going back after this HORRIBLE service.  I'll gladly pay $5 more at one of the smog stands than go back and be treated poorly and lied to.\n\nThis place deserves 0 stars.. but it won't let me give 0."
1,"I've been coming here for several years. Great service, good prices and great work! Highly recommended."
1,"The food here is great!  I had the tacos (choice of three) Chicken Adobo, Pork Sisig and the beefsteak for $6.95.  All great tasting and complimented with a vinaigrette slaw; however my favorite was the Pork Sisig. Centrally located, food is delicious, therefore I will be back!!!"
1,"Always great BBQ here. The pork ribs are done with Spare Ribs, plenty of awesome BBQ goodness. A great smoke on the ribs, perfectly sweet and tangy sauce and tons of southern style sides like red beans and rice, fried okra and beans. I got to try the beef ribs this past weekend (they usually run out) and they were good, but there was hardly no meat on them. Probably just a one off occurrence, since every other time I've been here this place delivers what I'm looking form. Great BBQ hidden in Central Phoenix."
1,"Very hearty, but high quality good here ..love the shrimp n grits, Rueben, and dBLT sandwich.  Quaint little place downtown and always busy ..good sign."
1,Since I was staying here I decided to put the baby & hubby to bed and see a movie. Went and saw a 3D one called Legend of the Guardians The Owls of  Ga'hoole. It was showing in the XD theater so it was 15 bucks to see it..no biggie since I had a coupon for free popcorn! I went and got a huge icee as well. The seats in the theater were super cushy and rocked. I was literally the only person there so I picked the best spot and hunkered down. Great movie for effects but it was soooo cold. I was glad I brought a jacket but wish I had brought socks.\nSo after it was over it was midnight and I went to the bathrooms..they were HORRIBLE! I give them 0 stars. So after my traumatic bathroom experience I walk out and see Resident Evil 3D just started and looked around and saw no-one and walked my ass in and sat down and saw another movie..for free.
0,"Besides bad food at Planet Dailies, I enjoyed my stay at PH last time. That was why I suggested my family to stay there this time. However, it was a disappointment. Was it because of spring break and the crowd? The bath tub in our room was not clean. My sister saw floating grey particles before she entered the tub. Yeah, that was gross. I asked house keeping to clean the tub but apparently the person who answered the phone did not understand the word \""tub\"". I repeated 5 time \""Please send someone to clean the bath tub\"" and all I got was \""what?\"" REALLY?"
1,"It's been two years since the Hill Group (Doug, Kirstin and Joshua) put us in our new home and we couldn't be happier.  They were great to work with, always accommodating and they provided all the info we needed to make a good decision.  We really enjoyed working with them through the entire process."
0,"I tried to order 12 breasts via the drive-thru, and the woman's voice on the speaker told me simply \""I can't give you twelve breasts\"" as if there was a rule against it.  This was a large order, but not so large that it shouldn't be fillable on demand.\n\nWe debated it for a little bit through the speaker, and she then said that if I were to wait 20 minutes, she would be able to fill my order.  There were other things as well, and a 20 minute wait in a drive-thru doesn't work, so I went inside to order.\n\nWhen I arrived, the same woman told me that \""if I sell you 12 breasts, then I don't have any chicken to sell other people.\""  She actually explained to me that \""chickens only have two breasts.\""  I instantly felt like she did not want MY business. \n\nLet me take this forum to explain something to the woman who dealt with me:  YOU SELL CHICKEN.  WHEN SOMEONE COMES INTO THE STORE TO BUY IT, YOU SELL IT TO THEM.  YOU DO NOT TELL THEM THAT SELLING IT TO THEM WOULD BE BAD.\n\nI've never had someone ACTIVELY discourage me from spending money in their establishment.  Thankfully I don't live in this area.  I would not visit this store again."
1,"I visit this place for a dinner on every trip to Vegas.\nFood quality and diversity is outstanding. Over the years, it has changed a bit to a little less french and a little more continental - I wish they would revert to more french.\nEverything we tried was expertly cooked and delicious."
0,NO STARS!! This place sucks balls! Manager was rude with us and even took it upon himself to get in my face and cuss me out when his lil security boys came up!  Long story short they kicked us out and didn't want to give me back my credit card until I was out of the bar! Def worst place on Mill! We have already contacted the corporate office and they seemed very shocked and offered for us to back with free drinks and food but we declined.. DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME HERE!!
0,"I scheduled an appointment for a physical for 9:45 am Friday June 29. 2012. I arrived 15 minutes early to complete all documentation including payment of my co-pay. I was required to sign a document stating I would be charged $25.00 if I missed an appointment and did not give your office a 24 hour notice.\n\nAfter 45 minutes, at 10:30 am I realized that no Dr. nor Physician Assistant was going to show up. I walked out of the holding room and received a reversal on my credit card of my co-pay. \n\nIf you do not have any respect for my time, how could I think that you would have any respect for my health?"
0,"So far nothing they did was of quality work. Had to bring back repair, steering went out with family in car. Getting follow up repair now, we'll see."
1,"I do not remember exactly what we had to eat, but I do remember loving the restaurant. Not only is the view spectacular, but the food is equally impressive. This is definitely a rarity for niche restaurants. In other words, good locations, views, celebrity chefs do not always equate to good food, this is not the case at Alize. The only reason it isn't a 5 star restaurant is because of the slower service. While it wasn't a problem, it was a bit slow. I will return here without question... maybe the best French in Vegas!"
1,Easy to navigate. Plenty of food options. Careful about the distance between terminals though..
0,"**DO NOT GO HERE!**\n\nArrived Wed night, wait would be 35-45 minutes.  No thank you...left.  Next night, Thurs, my boyfriend and I tried again for his birthday, using our $30 credit.  Called ahead to make reservations; told they don't make reservations unless you're in the building...ridiculous!  So, we arrive and the snooty group of hostesses at the front (3) ask if we have a reservation; obviously not as we couldn't make one per them.  Teppanyaki table wait again 35-45 min.  We sat at the Sushi Bar...at 6:50pm. Vivian, the waitress, comes over. Asks for our drink order; just waters. 10 min later, we get them.  Then, I review the menu, as I'm a vegetarian; not a whole lot to offer.  My boyfriend orders sushi to start, and gets it pretty promptly.  Then, I give her my order, and she walks away. Doesn't get my boyfriend's order.  After waiting another 10 min, she comes back with rice, that I ordered to come w/ vegetable tempura, and I ask her to bring it all together and proceed to tell her that my boyfriend would like to order.  Food took forever to come out.  Didn't get drink refills at all.  Then, we're done eating, waiting for the bill, and the waitress is nowhere in sight; we're an hour and a half into this now.  The sushi chef notices and tells her we're waiting.  She shows up, with a group of waitresses, singing Happy Birthday, and still no bill.  I would NEVER go back there!  It was the worst experience ever!  I have more details, just too much for this..."
1,"I can honestly say never been to Louisiana but since the day went too the original Lola  on Charleston. I feel like jumped on plane right on to bourbon street. Just soaking all the finest things the Big Easy has too offer especially the FOOD! Lola she all about keeping too her creole background and sticking with traditional fare but doing it right way from family secrets passed on from one generation to the next. The original location I have been couple times always end up going with one of the Po-Boys. Too DIE for and the most legit ones find in Vegas hands down!! So hearing that they opened second location one much closer on my side of town. Excited! \n\nSecond location sometimes have my doubts. I always think about \""is bigger always better\"". You start to lose focus on the things that made you popular in the first place and consistency of the food more locations add. Lola not only small restaurant but great story (one that featured on triple DDD). I love seeing small business owners successful. Right off the top from the moment walked in the vibe, and everything about the interior design screams at you Big Easy. It has the old school colonial look all around, they have area that assume all clams or oysters on ice shuck fresh too order, the bar area think really nice with the brick back splash look to the many widescreen televisions around it, different chairs around the bar area from bar stools to chairs, piano in the bar area (I went for lunch no one playing but assume they do have live music), and NO doubt part of Lola personal taste not miss. She big Saints fan. Dah! You have big Drew Bree artwork. There this shelf near the bar but it feels more like bookshelf at home. Here you have the little things from the mardi gras masks, beads, jars of candy, and all these little almost personnel items. Just the patio area kind of small but had so much personality. They have big oak barrels around, plants, and not just tables outside in open space. Heck you even looking out through window out on the patio area. Just the theme throughout the restaurant got lot of personality but everything that great about the Big Easy. \n\nThe food was awesome!!!! Like I said had my doubts. The Po-Boy went with the Roast Beef. The last time had the soft shell crab. I wanted to knock another one off the list. The bread with any sandwich make or break point for me. Po-Boy had so many imitations that once have the real thing never take step back. Lola is the only place get my Po-Boy on not place comes remotely close. Not just one thing but the BREAD really stands out for me. She gets it shipped in just for the sandwich. It not only the perfect compliment but could get bread all day long. The Roast Beef talk about lot of food. Messy. But nothing better then having the drippings from the beef, sauce, and some hot sauce icing on the cake. It finger licking good. I started with cup of gumbo. Perfect starter! Loved the fact both restaurant felt like the food was consistent. All the things that loved about the first one still are at the original and now the second location. Lola never meet owner that friendly, upbeat, and this passion for food not only saw on the show but in real life. She just happen be sitting at the bar area when I had lunch. It refreshing see owner go around check up on customers and asked my thoughts on my Po-Boy. No doubt plan on coming back again again.."
0,"On standby with nothing better to do but vent my frustrations about an airline that is completely incompetent!  \n\nTo start, my ticket did not have my TSA precheck on it (despite having called and spoken to the us airways rep on the phone the day prior).  My husband had his number, but not mine. So much for my efforts to call and make sure that was taking care of....doesnt help if only ONE of us has pre check. \n\nA journey from oakland to san antonio took nine hours because both of our flights were delayed.  I was accepting because the afternoon flights are not always timely. I forgave and forgot. \n\nHOWEVER....for our 8:45 flight, we woke up early to be on time.  It was still dark as we left our san antonio hotel (which, was awesome. Highly recommend the Mokara Hotel in San Antonio).  Again, my TSA precheck is not on my ticket but after 15 minutes of confusion, the us airways rep FINALLY enabled that.  Fast lane at security so i can go hurry and wait ar the gate. \n\nThen, waiting. And more waiting. For an 8:45 am flight, our odds were more promising. Not so. For some reason, the plane was not ready until 15 minutes after our flight was supposed to leave. Once boarded, another 45 minutes goes by with an announcement from the pilot that the bags were now on the flight. Really?  An hour after the flight was to leave, the first flight of the day, and the bags just got on?!  So that was why we were an hour late?\n\nSo i registered my concern to the stewardess that if our flight was an hour late, we would miss our connecting.  Not much she could do she said.  Finally, we landed and ran to our gate (mind you, we are with our six year old) and get there on the nose.  The gate agent said they closed the doors and we could not get on. Perfect. \n\nSo now my family is waiting another 3.5 hours to catch an alternate plane on standby. We should have been home now.  \n\nI have posted to my facebook that i am forever boycotting this airline. And guess what? my friends are commenting how they have had similar experiences and will never fly us airways!  \n\nI can only hope that we get in this flight, it is not delayed and are bags reach our destination. I may be back to edit this review...\n\nSo i am back to report that after arriving home (finally), we discovered that both of our pieces of luggage were wet inside and out. All clothes had to be washed or dry cleaned. Unbelievable."
0,"My friend was in town helping her sister get settled at ASU and they were in the mood for some close to authentic Mexican food. It's kind of a hidden gem, I've passed by this place tons of times while in the area and never even noticed it. I joined everyone on the patio and we immediately ordered a round of margaritas. They had the misters and the fans going so surprisingly it was bearable on the patio. I loved the ambiance of the patio, it's not super chic or anything but it's comfortable and makes you feel like you're on vacay somewhere near a beach :-) \n\nThe margaritas were tasty but this is where it started to go downhill for me...the service here is terrible, awful, slow, confusing, and a whole bunch of other words I'm not going to list. After we got our margs we sat with our menus in hand for a good 20 min! We didn't notice at first because we were chatting but after a while we were out of chips and salsa and noticed no one had come over to take our order. After we flagged down a server he took our orders, we asked for a refill on the chips and and salsa and water while we waited for our entrees and of course that never made it to our table. As we looked over to the bar area we noticed the servers and bartenders and servers chatting it up and watching the game, UNACCEPTABLE. \n\nOur food came out surprisingly fast! I ordered the shrimp enchiladas with half red and half greens sauce, it came with the standard rice and black beans. It was pretty yummy the sauces had a kick to them and mixed well with the cheeses. \n\nIf I wasn't having such a great time with my friends I would have definitely asked to speak to a manger. I wanted to give this place at least 3 stars but the bad service completely overshadowed my experience at this restaurant."
1,"this was my first visit to a Sizzler and I thought it was pretty good. The shrimp dinner I ordered was not that great but the salad and dessert bar made up for that. The place is no Golden Corral by any means but what they got is pretty good , you will leave with a full belly . the service was good and I was able to make a strawberry shortcake from the dessert bar. So I will say YAY I am a fan!"
0,ok went and ordered the humus which i found bland  and the kids chicken and cheese queseadilla which is probley the best thing i have had
1,"I like sweets. I like them a lot. I could eat them in a box, sitting on rocks, near a fox--whatever Dr. Seuss-ism comes to mind.\n\nSweet Impressions has really, really delightful cupcake flavors. Nutella, of course, being my personal favorite. I'm not a fan of buttercream, so I avoid ones with that topping and go towards the more \""ganache\"" type ones, which I think are crafted better in this establishment anyways.\n\nThe frosting is wonderful--but only for a few hours. After that, it begins to dry and become hard to eat. If you eat them right away, there should be no problem and that's how you know it's fresh.\n\nThe cake itself is very crumbly and a little hard to eat after you've cleared away the frosting. \n\nBut the cupcakes aren't the only services offered here: their candies are to die for just as much. I had an amaretto chocolate that was just oozing chocolate-amaretto goodness. If you've only had their cupcakes, you're missing out if you don't try their candies.\n\nPersonally, I like their candies a little bit better than their cupcakes--but they're both good for what they are. Especially in a town where bakeries are not very close to campus and college students having a difficulty trying to get out to."
0,"The atmosphere of the place is kind of neat, there are cards on the table and they're open pretty late, so it's a nice meet up place for those who work swing shift. However, in my opinion, the tea is lacking. I like milk tea, sweet and delicious a la Volcano Tea (which is conveniently within walking distance to this place) and Tea Station just didn't deliver. Their milk tea had an overbrewed tea flavor, that nearly choked me. I think my tea had been sitting stale just brewing and brewing for hours. and don't get me wrong, I LIKE strong tea! I also ordered tea eggs when I came in, which were absolutely vile and were untouched after the first bite. I cannot comment, however, on whether it was their version that was gross or whether I just hate all tea eggs. I remember my sister ordering a teriyaki chicken bowl or something similar, and it was also mediocre. Service is bad, you have to chase someone down to get any service, which made me feel like I was more of a burden than a customer. I won't be back, I'll just keep visiting my beloved Volcano Tea."
0,"I took my husband here for his 35th Birthday. We ordered Calamari for an appetizer we were completely disappointed, it was rubbery and the sauce was overpowering with sweetness and made everything mushy. It was obviously frozen. Their Ginger Alcoholic beverage was disgusting, too much ginger. One thing I can positively say is that the Prime Rib was out of this world!!! I highly recommend the Prime Rib to anyone who's looking for a good quality dinner!"
1,"Perfect way to end our weekend trip to Vegas was purchasing a day pass to Qua Baths & Spas.\n\nVery relaxing atmosphere with multiple jacuzzis, roman bath, sauna, steam room, plush robes, snacks, and a nice relaxing area to read magazines and drink tea. I love how spacious it is.\n\nThere's also a co-ed herbal dry sauna if you want to meet up with your sig-o.\n\nOur only regret is that we went in the evening  so was only able to stay for 1.5 hours but the day pass is good all day.\n\nMust do if you are staying at Caesars and like spas!\n\nTips:\n*Location is away from the casino, near the hotel registration, past Michael Richard's Central restaurant\n*Go on a sunday when Vegas is less crowded\n*Use SpaFinder gift certifcates to get extra 10-15% off\n*Spa Pass is good for all day from 6a-8p"
1,the hot dogs are pretty good here.  i've never had a hot dog in chicago...but i suppose they're prepared like a chicago dog.  \n\npersonally i'm not into poopy seed buns.  and i'm a plain old mustard and saukraut type of girl.  the neon green relish kind of weirds me out.
0,"From what I understand, Yelp is to review unique and fun places, not your typical everyday joints. For this review, and those rules, please accept my apology. What I have to say must be heard.\n\nYou see, Arby's is an amazing place. It is lumped in with the McDonalds and Burger Kings of the world, when in fact, it should hold a different place in the hearts of Americans. \n\nWhen I was 16 years old I landed my first real paper paycheck job at an Arby's in Holland, MI. I thought I was big time. I made $8.00 an hour. I scored free grub from time to time. I flirted with the lizadies who came through the drive through window. What else could you want? \n\nThrough my time at Arby's I learned a man named Russ Umphimheimer owns the most Arby's under an umbrella corporation called RTM. He also owned a few other joints I think a Hardees (never seen one), a breakfast roll place, etc. Arby's was his crowning achievement though. He owned an empire of roast beef and curly fries. I met him once and shook his hand. He had a bunch of gold rings. \n\nAnyway, now you have the background of my review, and you see I am only giving this joint 2 stars, you have to wonder why. I will tell you why..  no green beans on the menu.\n\nThrough out parts of the mid-west and the south there are renegade rebel Arby's. They were not bought out by RTM during Russ Umphenhimer's Arby's empire take over. Think of these places as the rebel alliance in Star Wars, and the RTM Arby's as The Empire. Russ Umphenhimer can be Darth Vader if you want him to be, but he's really not that mean. \n\nRTM (stands for Results Through Motivation) set a menu standard through out his millions of Arby's. Every menu had to be the same. You can always tell when you are in a rebel Arby's because they will have some random stuff on the menu, such as green beans. The franchisee operator will sell you green beans (at least they used to), but hardly any of the Arby's would order them because they were all RTM Arby's and thus, couldn't be free to set the menu as they saw fit. \n\nThis Arby's had it's typical roast beef sandwiches. I opted for the beef and cheddar sans red ranch sauce, cause I think it's gross and I saw somebody dump a whole tub on their head once and run around chasing a girl. Bad juju right there. I also ordered the chicken fingers, which are back on the menu after a couple year MIA stint. Topped it off with an order of curly fries and a jamoca shake. I can't spell jamoca. Sorry. \n\nThe food I ordered was great for a fast food joint, and worth the extra dollar to upgrade me from a whopper or big mac. However, to have a truly 5 star Arby's experience, I lust for the day where I can order green beans off of a fast food menu and have a hearty chuckle about this fact. Until this day, fight The Empire, and support your local rebel Arby's (they usually have those old signs \""Arby's Rost Beef Sandwich is Delicious\"")."
0,"I've stayed in some of the worst roach infested seaside motels in California, and this was easily the worst hotel I've ever been in. \n\nIt's Las Vegas, so you really aren't going to spend a ton of time in your room... however, the ability to shower before you go out is sort of a big deal. The shower in our room wouldn't drain and quickly filled up with water. I tried taking a pen and cramming it down the drain to see if I could fix it - I pulled the pen out and a hunk of foul hair and gunk came with it. \n\nThe drain was plugged up with some bitch's entire weave or something... perhaps a dog. We called down to the front desk and were transferred to the wrong department, transferred to a voice mail, and hung up on twice before we were able to get them to send someone out. \n\nThey sent out two maintenance guys to fix it and they spent a half hour blowing air down the drain with a hand pump. This did nothing. They left saying it was still slow, but working a little better. It didn't. All it did was make us late. \n\nIt wasn't just the bathtub malfunction that was a problem... the place was disgusting. There was some sort of small turd near the entry. The vent in the bathroom looked like there was a 1000 year old dead rat inside. The air conditioner sounded like an asthmatic and the busted tile beneath it was covered in dirt. There were all sorts of stains all over the carpet and anything with a surface was covered in layers of old dirt... tops of door frames, mirrors, headboards, etc... \n\nEvery shower curtain ring was broken as well - it felt like some sort of joke - like we were on some sort of reality show... someone just wanted to see us crack.\n\nSadly... the room was 150 per night because we got there on a busy weekend I suppose. Other people online had reported paying in the 30s for their room. I wouldn't have felt right paying 30 any more than I felt right paying 150. I took pictures of everything and brought them downstairs in the morning to the manager who acted relatively nice. I showed her the pictures on my camera and she had me wait to show her head of cleaning staff who looked at them and shrugged at me dismissively.\n\nIn the end, they comped my room. They should've given us tickets to something or gambling money or offered a free night in one of their nicer suites. Had they done anything more than comped the room, I would've tried to be a little more understanding. As it stands though, they did not. \n\nI paid nothing for this room in the end, and it damn near ruined my vacation. It's not worth it at 150, 90, 60, 30 dollars... not even zero. \n\nIf you're a college kid who is happy drinking Bud, your idea of 'ballin' is winning 50 cents in the penny slots, and you are in Vegas to throw televisions through windows and pee in the hallway... you have found your ideal hotel. For a cheap thrill, get in the elevator and ride it as high as it will go - you will fear for your life.\n\nFuck this place."
1,Great commiunication and cheapest rates I called about 10 other offices and they were really expensive. Adele was great and kept me form. Will recommend anybody .
0,"We drove up this morning and were a bit confused to find the cafe closed. Several other people were there staring at the deserted cafe and wondering where the staff was. We had all read this message on the cafe's website:\n\n\""From 6/4 to 6/19 Morning Glory will only be Open on Weekends.\""\n\nWouldn't you think that means they are still open on Thursday June 2nd?  Apparently, they meant to say \""closed weekdays starting 5/30\"", but aren't so good with the English language.\n\nOh well, it's a beautiful farm and almost worth driving out here just for the scenery. Ok, not really. If you are reading this, Morning Glory owners, please learn to communicate your seasonal closing dates  correctly next year."
1,"Just visiting from out of town and had dinner at this spot. Food was just what I needed (combo pho). Hesitated because of the bad service reported in the previous reviews, but my experience was great. Service was fast, efficient and friendly. Only 4 stars since I am from out of town- can't give 5 stars to a place I've only gone once."
1,Great grass-fed burgers!  Hands down the best burgers in Phoenix.  Very creative and more importantly Grass-fed.
0,"Only tried on beef taco, but not too great. The shredded beef didn't seem shredded, it seems more mushy and chopped. The taco shell was crispy, but outlandishly greasy at the bottom, which is typical, but this was too much grease. The taco was big and worth the $2.55, but the chicken option sadly is dark meat. The free chips and salsa (mild) were probably the best part of the this snack. Salsa was in small cups, but fresh and chips were hot and tasty. Big negative is not having horchata, even the counter girl questioned the manager on this big oversight. Decent lunch special - will give the place one more try for the tamale in the near future."
0,food sucks. tastes processed. cooked two days ago. vegetarian chili tasted okay. living off name and location. mostly deep-fried food. Cornbread from the day old store.
1,Good food.  Plus they deliver
1,"I have been a subscriber now for 3 1/2 years and have yet to miss a single issue.  I live in a secured building where the carrier has to get to the 5th floor every day, and does....before 6am.   I can't live without my sports page every day.    Thanks Republic!"
1,"First, the pizza was great.  Probably in the top three I've had in Phoenix.\n\nSecond, the delivery got screwed up.\n\nThird, when I called in, Christine the manager SWIFTLY took care of the issue and made me fully satisfied.  It was obvious that she is a professional, and has high standards for customer service.  I'll order from them again."
1,"First off, sit at the bar. Introduce yourself to a bartender and make yourself comfortable. The menu can be overwhelming, but the bartenders will walk you through it and answer any questions you might have. Like tequila? They have a drink for that. What about gin? They have a recommendation for that, too. Even if you don't know what you want, they will have something you will enjoy. Just look above the bar for a seemingly endless selection of spirits. They also have a nice wine and beer list on the wall. If you like cocktails, you will love this place. It's nothing fancy, but it doesn't have to be for people to enjoy it. The drinks are reasonably priced, too. Oh, and they list a \""Yelper of the week\"" on the menu. I hope I make the cut! To Bitter and Twisted, cheers."
0,"After paying nearly $3000 for a bedroom set, the finish started wearing off after less than ONE MONTH! Every piece of the 5 piece set is wearing off. It looks terrible. The mattresses are lumpy and you can actually feel springs while lying on the bed. They used unfinished pieces of wood as 'support' for the king size bed and b/c the bed is one of those super tall beds, you can SEE the unfinished pieces of wood while just standing in the hall way looking into the room! They're response was to send me more finish from the manufacturer so i can touch it up myself! Really??? At the rate it wore off, i'll be touching this cheap garbage up monthly and i'm sure it will look just great afterwards right? DON'T BUY ANYTHING FROM THIS PLACE! The Big Tin Shed is MUCH better quality, selection, customer service AND great prices. I learned an expensive lesson..."
1,Great place to hang out on Thursday nights and Saturdays. I come here with my friends when we want a change of scene from old town. The bars are cool and id check out gringo star and el hefe. Mill is fun just be careful on the streets alone. Also la boca is great along with z Tejas and ra.
0,"Sorry Freed's you have diminished since your move to Henderson. I used to frequent Freed's when they were on the East Side of town. \n\nI went here today with my mother for two reasons:\n\n1. I wanted a delicious treat\n2. I am getting married and was interested in looking into their wedding cakes\n\nFirst off the shop IS nice. It is clean, everything smelt so yummy when we walked in. The place where (I assume) they do consultations for wedding/event cakes, etc was behind a glass panel. My mother and I walked in and all the women were busy so we started taking a look at their books with pictures of cakes.\n\nEventually someone came up to us and asked us if we had been helped. I said no and proceeded to ask this person about whether or not they make traditional French wedding cakes. These wedding cakes are called croquembouches. Considering Freed's makes many other things besides cakes I assumed they would at least KNOW what a croquembouche WAS. Well, this lady had no idea what I was talking about. I don't mean to be a snot, and I'm certainly not a snob, but seriously... how can you work in a wedding cake consultation place at a bakery that makes many confectioneries and at least not know what a croquembouche is?\n\nAfter my mother and I left the dazed and confused wedding cake woman we went back into the bakery and proceeded to wait a heinously long amount of time to get our 1 piece of red velvet cake and our 1 cannoli. They were good... but not THAT good.\n\nObviously I'm taking my Frenchy wedding cake dreams elsewhere to the many other bakeries/cake makers in Las Vegas who know what a croquembouche is."
1,Went there with a friend for dinner (at his recommendation).  Wasn't sure what to expect but I enjoyed it very much.  The food was excellent.  However be warned... If you do not eat a lot of red meat you may want to go someplace else.  I don't know if I was in a food coma and didn't get the concept of the stop/go rules but 20 mins after being their I had to wave the flag of surrender.  Will def go back.
0,"Nice grounds. Ok room. Internet went down.  Maid never came to room at a normal hour. We would be back from the pool or golf or other day activity around 6 pm and getting ready for the evening, and would get a knock on the door and them attempting to clean the room. I have never stayed at a resort where the maids come past 3-4, let alone that late. Our room got cleaned once in 4 days. Terrible customer service. So hard to get ahold of anyone while staying here. Left countless messages that went unreturned. Set up cabana at pool and let concierge know I would have guests weeks in advance via email. Day of they told me I had a limit. Almost Ruined birthday party. Pretty much Ruined our stay as it pissed me off beyond comprehension. I was forced to talk to multiple different managers delaying start of festivities. Finally I had to pay for another room that I didn't need to get everyone in. All could have been solved with  clear communication from beginning on their part. Food sucks on top of that. Too many good options in this area to deal with the garbage customer service and nickel and diming guests who plan to spend thousands here over one weekend. My experience at this hotel has soured me on the entire westin and Starwood brand. People come to resorts to relax and have fun. My stay here has been anything but due to them putting me through the ringer and trying to squeeze every last dollar out of me. Avoid at all costs."
0,"This is a shithole. Overrated and gross watery cold food. Horrible rude waiters who don't care about you if you're in a large party, because they know they are getting their 18 percent gratuity added in the bill anyways. Good luck on getting a martini refill or any apology."
1,"Absolutely loved it.  I had a craving for Swedish meatballs and found this place by browsing Yelp.  We drove all the way from North Scottsdale to try it.  Totally worth it.  I tried the meatballs with coleslaw, dill mashed potatoes, and basil tomatoes.  My husband got a steamed fish dish with fries, peas, and a spinach salad.  Everything was REALLY good and homemade.  The coleslaw was not like the regular coleslaw you would expect, but it was fantastic.  All real, fresh ingredients too... no fake potato spud mix, no frozen/canned peas.\n\nThe people there were lovely too.  All so friendly and sweet.\n\nWe got there a half hour after they opened, and there was only one family in there ordering before us.  Three tables were already on reserve though.  When we started eating, the restaurant packed up pretty quickly.\n\nLove this place and will definitely make the drive to go back."
1,"No bells and whistles. It's not \""hip\"" or \""pretty.\""  You def feel like you're back in like 1975 working out with Rocky or something.  HOWEVER it gets the job done.  basic hours so doesn't fit crazy lifestyles.  And... super freaking cheap.  $75 for a whole year? Worth it.  The classes are solid.  Everyone is nice.  No one is there to see and be seen which is probably the best part.  You don't feel self conscience.  I could be considered high maitenance every now and then, but when it come sto a gym I'm good with this.  Location is very central too.  And if you love the SF Giants, then you're adjacent to their training facility."
0,This Sushi place is way overpriced and the sushi rolls are not that great.  We stayed in the Palazzo at the Venetian and wanted sushi.  We were disappointed.  The sushi rolls are tiny and tasted mediocre.  The only thing that I liked was the sashimi and the sauce that came with it.  This place is not worth it.
1,"Can someone please tell me why we can expense $1,200 for bottle service, but I'm not allowed to have colored post-it notes?\n\nShanna Moakler's birthday, but we were treated like celebrities.  Call ahead and speak with someone in charge.  8 guys/2 gals and we were ushered in with no wait at 10:30 pm on a Saturday."
1,"Good cheap beer, cute but slightly crowded atmosphere but Darby O'Gill and the Little People make up for it with their fun Irish music. They are the main reason why I go to Quinn's, but it is still a cute little pub and a great hang out spot with friends."
0,I was excited to eat here after reading the reviews. Then I ate there and I was less excited. \n\nI was prepped for some hot spicy New Mexican food. That did not arrive on my plate. It was tasty for sure but I was lead to believe that I would experience the food I grew up with in New Mexico. I didn't. \n\nIt is possible that my expectations were too much for this restaurant to handle.
0,First and last time in this store this afternoon.   The clerk behind the counter complained about the customer who left as I was coming in and then proceeded to lecture me about my desired supplements.  She lost over $150 sale today and many more in the future as this store is on my way home but I will go out of my way for better customer service.
1,"Port Authority (formerly known as PATransit, or \""PAT\"") operates a fairly extensive network of buses and (in the South Hills) light rail. Instead of running school buses, the school district gave high schoolers bus passes to get to class, and I have used the bus since 1997.\n\nI've had a great experience using the bus in Pittsburgh. I didn't get a driver's license until I was almost 19--the bus (\""Miss Pat\""--another nickname) and my bike got me everywhere I needed to go. There will inevitably be delays and problems, but that is common to all modes of transportation. The price is right (especially with a \""free\"" bus pass; students see below) and if you live and work in the city, you should consider making the bus your main means of commuting.\n\nThe system is largely built on the legacy of pre-World War II trolley lines, so the neighborhoods that were developed before 1950 are fairly well-served, while more recent developments can be harder to navigate by bus. The system just had a major overhaul (in spring 2010) but still travel many of the same routes.\n\nThe route numbering system is complicated, and there are many exceptions, but as a rule, the routes are numbered in a counter-clockwise fashion from downtown. The \""oughts\"" and 10's go north, the 20's and 30's go west, the 40's and 50's go south, and the 60's, 70's, 80's an 90's go east. Routes that are just letters are express or flyer routes, which may go on one of three \""busways,\"" transit-only highways that bypass traffic jams. The light rail (known as the \""T\"" or the trolley) serves southern city and suburban neighborhoods above ground, and has three underground stations downtown, with a major construction project underway to extend trains to the North Side, projected for completion in 2011.\n\nThe University of Pittsburgh and Carnegie Mellon University (among others) have agreements with the Port Authority to allow students, staff and faculty to use their university IDs as bus passes. Others can purchase passes at $75 per month or $20 per week, while a local one-way fare is $2.00. Port Authority is supposed to be rolling out a \""smart card\"" digital payment system (\u00e0 la WMATA's SmarTrip or London's Oyster) soon, but that remains in development.\n\nOne especially great value is the 28X, a route serving the Pittsburgh International Airport from Downtown and Oakland (the university district) via the West Busway. Fare, as of mid-2010, is $2.75, compared with taxis and other shuttles costing $30 or more. The 28X runs every half hour and takes around 35 minutes to get to the airport from downtown, or 15 minutes longer from Oakland.\n\nThe Port Authority's fare revenues cover only a fraction of its expenses, and the state and county's perennial budget problems have caused several funding crises in recent years."
1,"Came here on Sunday for lunch and had an absolutely delicious halloumi burger, while my boyfriend had the Aussie beef burger. Whatever rumours of legendary burgers exist about the Cambridge Bar, they're all true. Both burgers were generously portioned--typical halloumi burgers feature a small slice of halloumi but this one was enormous--and well-seasoned and very, very tasty. We also had vanilla and peanut butter milkshakes were are even now making my mouth water just thinking about them. Next time I have a hankering for a burger, this is absolutely where I'd go, and I'd recommend it wholeheartedly."
1,"a little confusing at times to get around but overall not too bad! Make sure to walk past the main food court to find a little more options. That being said, it is still airport prices A.K.A 9 dollar sandwhich"
0,"Not impressed.  I really craved/wanted hash browns, but didn't want eggs.  After the waitress confused me with suggestions of specials and what can/can't be substituted I thought I was good to go.  After way to large a portion of (good) bluebery pancakes, sausage, and biscuits, there was still no hash browns.  Turns out she goofed.  And her mistake cost me $13!!! Sorry, but $13 for no eggs or hash browns + sloppy service makes me want to do the casino buffets.  I explained to the cashier how unhappy I was and she could not have been any more uninterested."
1,"A pretty decent selection of Microbrews.  Most are priced well, some a bit over priced.  Food is good, quick, easy, and cheap.  I'll be back for more!"
1,"Classic delicious wings. Beer specials for happy hour. Friendly bartenders/waiters that sing to you and their coworkers, and FOOTBALL/any other sport you could imagine on their numerous big screens around the bar. I hope you have a ride home after your awesome sports outing, because you should stay a while!"
1,We came here for the burgers and they were good but not the best we have had. They do have an awesome variety of beers including Prohibition and Stone from our local area of San Diego. We went to watch the Monday night football game and don't recommend it. I would go to a different place to watch games. But food was good and beer was also.
1,"Good food as usual. Great selection of Sushi and for dinner had the shrimp kabobs and shrimp tempura. The price is a bit higher for dinner at $26.95 a person but it's a good price for what you get.\n\nAlso, they have crab legs too but cold. If you want they can heat them for you, just ask someone behind the counter.\n\nThanks."
1,"The family likes this place. Planning our next trip so my son can eat the 1/2 pound, and I can eat the 1 pound."
1,"Chicken salad sub was awesome, portions were good and staff was friendly will definitely eat here again!"
0,Not going to be long winded but here goes. Drive 6 hours to get here. Our server Chelsea was fantastic. Atmosphere was good. Lobster poutine.....barely any lobster or gravy or cheese and had to pull 2 lobster shells out oft mouth. Pretty much a bowl of fries. Seafood risotto......started off great until chewing on unshelled shrimp. Not at all appetizing since bill for table of 4 was over 300.00 . Will not be back
1,Eaten here many times and enjoyed most of there food.  Just wish the prices would come down some and they use different types of Frys.
0,"WARNING - DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY. They caused damage to my pool equipment, left w/o testing re-assembly, and allowed 100's of gallons of water to leak caused unkown amount of damage to my house foundation. Then came the bad part ..... they incorrectly diagnosted the real pool leak ... causing me to tear up my pool deck for no reason. When I complained, they came back out and found the real leak 20 ft away on a completely different line. Thier resonse to this great service  ... \""sorry aobut your troubles\"". They have one good employee (Vince). The rest of the service guys are dangeroius .... I tired BBB and ROC but they operate w/o a contractor liscense under the handy man state law .... BE WARNED ... VERY WARNED"
1,"unlike some airports where you have to pay for wireless *cough, sfo, *cough...sky harbor offers it for free.\nthat being said, they had me at free wireless.\nin addition, they also have a wendy's...\nso not only can you write a yelp review, and/or update your facebook status, and/or tweet (twitter?) ; you can also do so while enjoying a chocolate frosty. with fries. not that that's what I usually do....\nglad that's been established. \n\nanyway, they also offer stores where you can purchase crucial items such as a cactus shaped lollipop or a magnet that says: someone who loves me went to arizona and brought me back this magent...\n\nthank you sky harbor for being the best airport on the west coast."
0,"This place is just bad. We were delayed over 5 hours coming home from Vegas and needed somewhere to eat lunch. Decided on this place and was not the best idea.\n\nOrdered chips and salsa - the chips were not fresh, not even close to Tostitos quality. They were just bland bagged tortilla chips and the salsa was so watery and flavorless.\n\nI ordered tacos with carne asada and I would have enjoyed a can of dog food more than I enjoyed this. The meat was really gross and the rice tasted like soggy nothing.\n\nDon't go here. You're better off going to Burger King."
0,Terrible car wash. They are so busy that they let the vehicles air dry instead of wiping them down but when they do wipe them it's with a wet towel.   Worst car wash ever. Streaks where they did wipe down. Windshield dirty inside and out. Road and bug residue all over the front after the wash. Outside rubber and plastic treatment applied with many missing spots.   They may do good elsewhere but don't recommend this place at all.
0,"The atmosphere is nice and the presentation is unique and refreshing. The food on the other hand is simply embarrassing. \n\nThe Asian dishes:\nBroccoli Beef was beef with broccoli stems\nUnlabeled Eggplant thing - not good\nPotstickers were beyond cold\nPork had no crust and was bland\nBeef ribs were pretty good\nPork ribs were ridiculous \n\nMexican:\nServed in pots and neither attractive nor cohesive\n\nAmerican Comfort Food:\nInexcusable not to have white meat as an option for fried chicken\nThe sweet potato fries were soggy\nThe meat section while impressive to look at came up way short with bacon that lacked smoke, brisket that was dry and mediocre at best\n\nSushi:\nDon't go to any buffet for sushi\n\nDessert:\nSorbet was good and earned a star on its own. Otherwise the taffy was rock hard and creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e was simply not good. \n\nThe seafood is the mainstay and was good. If you want to spend $45.00 for all you can eat crab legs and shrimp then mission accomplished. ."
0,Famous chef attraction. Nothing special about the place.
0,"What a terrible event. We showed up at 1 pm to eat and they were not ready. We ordered from another vendor their fried cat fish ,and it was not cooked all the way,they did refund our money for the food. We left right away, this event was advertised as a craw fish festival and all I saw was a few food vendors who were cooking in a small electric frying pan like the one you would use in your kitchen. Shame on the sponsors who ran this event. I give this a zero rating, hope you can do better next time, there were a lot of disappointed people there today.\n\n                            Cheryl Cormaci"
1,"For a while I had been trying to remember the name of the steakhouse I went to that had, by far, the most incredible steak I have ever tasted in my life. I was able to locate this steakhouse via Yelp and immediately recognized it.\n\nFirst of all, it's probably been about 3 years since I've eaten there, but that does not mean that any ounce of my being has forgotten about the delicious steak and everything else I consumed that very night. Now, I love a good steak. I order steaks the way they should be ordered, medium rare. And I am not usually a fan of having any type of crust or marinade on a steak because I love the real flavor of the meat. I am only saying this so that you know that this review comes from someone who actually loves steak.\n\nNow, if you are finding yourself in Vegas or are going there for whatever reason, and you are looking for a good steakhouse, you MUST go to this place. Sure, it will cost you a pretty penny, but to me it's worth it.\n\nAmbiance is good, steak is absolutely cooked to perfection, and all the side dishes are killer."
0,"Over priced, takes to long and food is mediocre at best.  To bad, we are always excited for new restaurants in Queen Creek. We probably won't go back."
0,"Great place to get FUCKED.

0,"It seems most people had decent service here but that was NOT the case with our table last night. We went in for dinner and THREE tables that came after us were served ahead of us. The only reason we even got to order in the first place was because I got up and pulled a waiter to our table. Not only that, there was a table that arrived ten minutes after we ordered and STILL got their food before we did. They even ordered almost the same identical food we did (breakfast food; hash browns and eggs). The only difference is one of us got steak and eggs. \n\nWhen the food finally arrived, the scrambled eggs were really disgusting like the kind you leave in the pan too long until it gets watery and mushy. The steak was supposed to be medium rare but was barely that, more on the rare side. Hash browns also had the same \""heated too long on pan\"" mushiness. Overall it was a disgusting experience for us, and even waiting for the check had to take forever. I repeat, we watched three tables that came in at various times after us get food before we did.\n\nWe may have just been that unlucky table, but everything about the experience put us in a bad mood to start off the night. Luckily it's hard to stay in a bad mood in Vegas."
1,one of my fav hotels
0,"Why am I reviewing Taco Bell? I like this particular Taco Bell because it also is a combined Pizza Hut. \nI like to get pizza on the go when I am in a hurry, so this is pretty convenient for me. What I do not like is that they ALWAYS mess up my order here. I can't even count how many times I've had to walk back into the store and ask for them to fix it. \nOne time, they asked me to pull in front of the store to wait for my pizza because it was still baking for about five more minutes. If I wanted to wait for my pizza I wouldn't have come to a FAST food joint. If you don't have it ready, tell met that so I don't have to wait and be late getting back to work. Anyway, I ended up waiting about 10-15 minutes before I walked into the store just to find out that they completely forgot about me. I had already paid and everything! \nI do love that they have Mountain Dew Baja Blast at this location."
1,"I agree with other yelpers in regretting not coming here more often. This is a very affordable place to eat in Vegas and is very delicious! My party loved it so much we came back the very next day as our last meal in Vegas.\n\nLocation/parking: Located inside the Planet Hollywood Casino right across from the sports bar.\n\nSeating/wait: Quick moving line if you want to order. Better to send someone from your party to find a table during busy times.\n\nService: Order over the counter. Sit and enjoy!\n\nFood:\n-Tomato soup with croutons (I asked for it on the side). This is hands down my favorite tomato soup every. EWW!!! Tomato soup. No really. I usually don't order tomato soup but I've ordered this every time I've been here. I suggest asking for croutons on the side. Otherwise, they come included in the soup and it may be soggy by the time you find a spot to sit.\n-Potato salad cup from fridge: it's a 2 star. It's as if you got potato salad from a super market.\n-Sugar cookie: pretty good/ok.\n-Brownie creme (looks like oreo whoopee): I thought it was ok.\n-The Earl's club sandwich: Amazing! Club sandwiches are usually all the same but it very god here.\n-Caribbean Jerk Chick Sandwich: delicious.\nCan't remember what the other 2 sandwiches were but all delicious.\n\nThis place is so good. \""Earl\"" of sandwiches is quite demeaning. It should be at least a Duke of Sandwiches."
1,"Tessaros has a full menu, but if you go there you need, no you must order a burger.   They have the very best restaurant burgers I have ever eaten.   Not greasy, great taste, and they grill them right there in the bar.\n\nDon't miss out on the best burger of your life."
1,"As a UW student, this is my favorite university bar. It is a fun crowd, great music and plenty of room to create your own dance party. My most memorable summer nights were spent on that patio and I am often found near their fantastic juke box. \n\nThe food is delish. Their sandwiches are anything but subpar and perfect hangover food. The spuds are enormous and sooo good -you gotta get one with queso, their queso is orgasmic. And the drink specials are awesome, I mean 50 cent beers?1 dollar rails? yes please. Not to mention they are the home of the a lil something called the shnorkel... which you need to try if you have not. \n\nChasers is good people. As a regular, I have gotten to know the staff quite well and really appreciate how friendly, fun and attentive they are. I always have a good time here and I think the reason for that is the awesome crowd."

0,"Let me start off by writing why I gave this restaurant a 2 star rating. I give it  2 because the combination fried rice my fiance ordered was really good and taste authentic. \nMy visit here was horrible!! and whatever your definition of horrible is I must say I agree. We ordered our food @ exactly 11:11 my fiance's rice arrived at 11:35 not bad right?  24 minutes after ordering I'm sure the food is gonna be great. Around 11:40 umm where is my  food? (we ask athe server)  I then taste his rice and oh yes his rice is really good. 11:45 I still don't have  my food 11:48 okay? well now that he's done eating I think we should pay for what we ordered. I tell the server to please give us the check, he then tries to give us the check and the rest of our order to go! I was like really? really? I told him I don't want the food and that we will only pay for what we received. Not one person gave us an explanation on why we never received the rest of our order and or tried to appologize for what happened. I was upset and hungry, not a good combination but hey my fances combination fried rice was delicious. So unless you have time for someone else to waste your time, go right ahead and enjoy the food!"
1,"Only 4 stars because I have seen better. Nevertheless, AJ's is a great runner up to my personal favorite which is the  thriving local business of Portland, OR called New Seasons. If you have been to a new seasons you know that AJ's is the close primo of find food grocers.\n\nI will one day visit the the other AJ's in town.\n\nThis place is a nice bike ride to from my house and has really nice employees...AND THE ONLY place near me that sells kombucha\n\nRelax and pleasant atmosphere. [like]!   \n\nR\\_"
0,"The smell of the place took me off at the beginning of the experience. I was shocked-perhaps it was the carpet? No one was there but they still sat us in a far off corner which felt weird as well. We ordered their new pretzel burger which tasted good but was super greasy. I could not eat the whole thing because of the grease, no wonder it tasted good. My daughter got a chicken strip meal and was satisified. For dessert we had the red velvet cupcake but we could have gotten better choices at a grocery store. Don't think I will go out of my way to eat here again. When we left we went to Culver's next door for ice cream and that seemed to make the meal better!"

At the time I purchased the package they never informed me that the classes expired.  I got really busy with the school year and was only able to attend a few of the classes.  It had been several months since the last time I attended a class, and when I showed up they informed me that I did not have any classes remaining.  I assured them that I did, in fact I should have 6 classes remaining, but they were extremely dismissive and told me the pass must have expired.  I will never go to this studio again, and I intend to tell everyone at my school that they steal your money.  With as much school loans as I have, I cant afford to give my money to a sleazy yoga studio."
1,"This place is great for going after work, and it's down the street from my place, so it's great for happy hour specials where appetizers are $5 and you can get $2 drafts. There are tons of tv's so you can watch all sorts of games, but beware, the owner is a huge cowboys fan so those games will always take precedence over other teams.  The food has been great and their happy hour cocktail specials are pretty good and strong so you get your money's worth. I am a big fan of the nachos, sweet chili thai wings, and the fried zucchini. We held our fantasy football draft here as well, and they put us in the boardroom (like on the apprentice) and we kind of got our own private, quieter area for hanging out which is great. Karaoke nights are funny, some people have no shame =)"
1,"Fifth & Wine is a nice wine bar in Old Town. The staff was great, very helpful. In fact, they sat down with us repeatedly throughout our visit to check on us, tell us a little bit about the place and the menu. \n\nThe bruschetta is delicious, inventive and reasonably priced. They only have one Sauvignon Blanc, but the one they have is pretty good. Lots of cozy couch seating in addition to the bar and table set-ups. Great happy hour. Check it."
1,As soon as I walked in I was greeted by three very friendly (not over the top friendly which I loved) hostesses. Not only that but I had a nice conversation with one before I was seated. At first glance the menu is pretty standard bar food but many of the items and food combinations I never saw before so naturally I was impressed. In all honesty the best part of my night out at Twin Peaks was my server. She sat down at my table and talked to me about the food and drinks in a very friendly (once again not a creepy friendly way either) and we had a very good conversation where I really got to know her and she got to know me. What I noticed was all the servers behaved the same way and to me good server customer relations are always a great sign. In all honestly what really made my night was how welcomed I felt and to me being greeted with genuine warm hospitality is always a plus (not to mention everything on the menu is very reasonably priced and you really get the bang for your buck). Another thing I absolutely loved was the kind of music that Twin Peaks has. Silly I know but that's another thing I look for in a good restaurant. One other thing I should point out is the great merchandise available to purchase. Not only do you have the choice of shirts and baseball hats but also a really nice and functional winter cap (I plan on buying one next time I come in) Now my one and only complaint is there's dozens of televisions but they all have the exact same thing on. To me that's pretty redundant and if I was actually interested in eating out or sitting at a bar and needed to keep up with a sports game this would be a huge flaw (luckily I'm not that kind of person). All in all it was a very good experience and I ended up coming back again not that long after. Honestly I'll probably make it a weekly ritual and that to me is a true sign of a good place to go to. I highly recommend going to this restaurant for a good relaxed meal that won't break your bank account or let you down in the service department.
0,"First of all. This place needs to keep a clean counter around the fish cake baking machine  \n\nI ordered a passion fruit iced tea and strawberry. 1. It was sweet. 2. You can taste the syrup. \n\nI went back to the employee where he was gone outside I believe chatting with friends and I was waiting at the counter for 15 minutes wondering if I can get my drink less sweet somehow. He comes back and tells me it's just syrup and water. NO TEA! WTF! Horrible service from a brace face kid. So if you want syrup water, come on over here. Or buy some kool aid in the market next door."
1,"It was one of the best hotel experiences I have ever had. The hotel is lovely and comfortable, the rooms are very large and laid-out very intelligently to allow guests to live and work in the room in comfort. There is a work desk and a large sofa and even a wet bar with refrigerator. The decoration throughout the hotel is very attractive. The fitness center is large with a nice variety of machines. The staff could not be better, everyone who works here is friendly and efficient and really helped us with our business and personal needs. The free breakfast is the best I have ever had at a hotel and the 24-hour menu is nice and not overly expensive. The Internet connection was fast and reliable. I could not have been more pleased."
0,I used to come here all the time with friends for the ufc ppv and before it was always packed and the service and drinks were great. Now a few months later I came here and the place has completely gone downhill. The food has changed and I ordered a margherita and I got some fruity drink that has a rotten lime in it. New management or something ruined it. Never again will I come here.
1,"The Studio Cafe pretty much rocks in my opinion... it's decent food at a decent price, open 24/7.  I've had a couple of very late night dinners there and it really is a calm in the storm of hotel."
0,"Read all the reviews before going so I was a little skeptical but thought I would try anyway. Cute little place, seated right away which was good for a Saturday at 1230. Ordered eggs Benedict but they had sold out! A breakfast place that runs out of breakfast food, hum. Got the breakfast sandwich which came out cut in half, on a large white plate with no garnish. Had to ask for silverware and napkins. Service was ok, sandwich average."
0,"Definitely nothing to write home about. Generic Italian food.  Pizza crust wasn't bad, but the pastas we had were on the gummy side.  Also the Mozzarella Carrozza appetizer was nothing more than deep fried grilled cheese sandwich. Tomato sauce tasted like canned tomatoes heated up. Lame."
0,"I love fish tacos and although I do enjoy coming here, I don't think their fish is that fresh.  Well, let me rephrase, I don't think the oil they fry their fish in is that fresh.  It went past the due date of how often oil should be changed out when frying food.  Don't skimp out on this step Rubio's!\n\nOther than that, the service was good, the salsa was good and the experience as a whole wasn't too bad.  They just really need to work on changing out their oil more frequently."
1,Lots of fun; totally worth 25 bucks! I totally drank my monies worth and enjoyed the the scenery and break from Vegas!
1,"It was my first time here. I ordered the Chicken Pot Pie and the Pork Rinds. First out were the pork rinds, they looked store bought, but I gave them a shot...nope, tasted store bought as well. It felt to me like they just warmed them up and served them. Not impressed. Next out was the pot pie. Not a traditional looking pot pie. It had a lattice  pattern crust just laying on top. The crust was very buttery, so much so it over powered the rest of the flavors in the pie. The veggies were a disappointment as well. Tasted and looked as if they were from a can of veggie medley. \n   Now the good news, a gentleman (who I assume was the manager) came to ask how my meal was and I told him. He told me how they were planning to take the pot pie off the menu for some of the reasons I had described and replaced my pork rinds with the Grilled Bacon appetizer. Now that was amazing! Think cut bacon steaks with a jalape\u00f1o jelly that had just the right kick and a slaw of pickled cucumbers and carrots. That made up for my entire meal. And the fact the management was concerned enough to ask about my meal because he didn't see me touching the pork rinds let me know they care about their food. I'll be returning to find an entree I really enjoy as I found my appetizer."
0,"On our way (lost) to the \""all you can eat/drink breakfast buffet with complimentary memosas\"" and stopped at a bar downstairs to ask directions.....thinking we were a long way from the breakfast bar.  The dink of a bartender sells my wife an $18 memosa, and then says \""your breakfast spot is right up the stairs\"".  He was rude, more times than once.  I think it's called the ice bar....pool level.  Stay away.  Scam."
0,"The issues with my vehicle have still not been addressed. David, the manager, has told me I needed new parts, ordered them, and then called me back to say they were not the correct parts and now the correct part will cost over $500 plus labor. (labor that he previously said would be covered due to the inconvenience)\nThe excessive waste of time, inability to address the issue, continued disappointment and steeply rising costs have brought me to the point where I will be contacting the BBB to report this Midas station, and contacting my bank to process a chargeback. For three days my car has been tinkered with and still it sounds worse than when I brought it in."
1,"This has been my favorite brand of iced tea since I tried it 10 years ago. Many restaurants use this brand and it's always good. I initially purchased the iced tea at AJ's fine foods. When I found out there was a store located at the headquarters in Scottsdale, I had to check it out. The teas are to the left when you walk in. I didn't know that they also sell a large selection of hot teas. They usually have 2 iced teas already brewed and there are hard logo'd plastic cups that you can take to go. While I was there a couple of employees from the surrounding area came in to get their refill of iced tea. I asked the receptionist what a certain hot tea tasted like and she said I could try whatever hot tea I wanted to. The prices are great and better than the area retail stores. I usually stock up when I'm in the area. If you like tea, I suggest you stop by so you can taste and discover the variety offered."
0,"One star reviews are really rare for me, So much so, that, if I am giving a one star review, I will usually just not even bother to write the review. \n\nCoach and Willie's probably deserves better, but for what we paid and the quality of food we got, I have to do what I have to do.  Here goes...\n\nWe had been given tickets to the Diamondbacks game and, not too familiar with the area, this was the first place we found. The game was starting in a little over an hour when we showed up. Even at that, we did not get bad service, the one star is primarily directed at the food, which was not good.\n\nI get very dismayed when something on the menu sounds really good and is such a disappointment. I ordered the Baja Fish Wrap. I love fish tacos and this sounded like something in the same vein. They do give you a choice of sides. I chose the wedge salad. The fish was bland. The lavosh wrap around it was soggy and falling apart. The menu promised spicy sauce... again bland. The wedge salad was a travesty. It was just an unwieldy wedge of lettuce with a small amount of dressing on it. It took up over half the plate. When you tried to cut it it made everything slide off the other side. I gave up on it after the first few bites. It wasn't worth the work and mess. My wife had a nearly identical experience with her tequlila-lime chicken wrap... no flavor at all in any of the food.\n\nThese sandwiches and two drinks cost us over $50. Hence, one star. We won't be going back here."
1,"I've been buying dog food and dog hygiene/medical products here for the last six months, and I've found that the staff are really knowledgeable, and they are also low-pressure. These guys genuinely want to help you find the right product, and they don't try to up-sell or plug extra/unnecessary stuff. The store area itself can feel kind of cramped, but I'd much rather spend less time getting the right thing and support a local business than wander through the aisles of a big-box store searching for a product I may or may not need."
1,"I had the Thin Man and a Leek and Bacon soup while I was here, and all I can say is WOWZA! Everyone is right about their special sauce. The delicious, quality food matched the delightful, friendly master chef's (and their mom!). The atmosphere, staff, and food of this place will definitely keep me coming back for more affordably fantastic food."
1,"Good food and great service. Of course, if you're staying in the camelback you'll most definitely have already been here.\n\nWarning, there is no Sunday brunch in the summer months!\n\nI recommend the tortilla soup, and don't get the soupy, salty enchiladas!"
0,"This place is OK.  The food was prepared very, very well.  But the dishes were really boring.  The scallops were served with a wear array of accompanying sauces; the desserts were uninspired; and the appetizers were unremarkable.  The food is actually 3 stars, but considering the price, it's gotta be 2 stars."
1,"I had the Pollo Torta...and for $7, it is an insanely large sandwich with mounds of fresh chicken and delicious condiments (like the black bean spread or the fresh cabbage).  You've gotta ask for the \""avocado crema\"" to be added to whatever you order!  I was thoroughly satisfied, and am excited about its great location downtown!"
1,"Thank God for the  caring nurses and excellent Drs.My mom spent 2 weeks here, in ICU after lung surgery.  Its a nice hospital with an excellent staff.  Good food too!  Cheers and thank you to all the awsome people who took care of my Mom, Joyce."
1,"LOVE this place! I had never been into a which wich before so an employee came out and explained the entire process to me.\n\nYou pick what kind of sandwich you want, get the corresponding paper bag, then mark off all the ingredients and sauces you want with a provided marker and take it up to the counter to pay for it. \n\nThey have fantastic options for toppings and sauces and it takes the guesswork out of building a sandwich. No longer do you have to say, no mushrooms, no onions, add avocado, etc etc. \n\nYour sandwich, your way.\n\nGreat flavor and high quality products. Here's a tip, pick the skinny sandwich bread and they take some of the bread out of the middle to save you about 80 calories and make more room for more toppings!"
0,Dirty and food was not good. My mother and I had to rush home...bathroom!\nIHOP's what is going on! Go back to closing at 9/10 p.m. so you can clean your better.
0,"Went there on a Friday night with a friend after trying several places nearby that were crowded and had a long wait. We ended up here as a last-resort and I had doubts that the vegetarian-only menu was going to satisfy my palette (I'm very pro-animal but I also crave FLAVAAAA!). This is a very small restaurant and the place was relatively empty. Hmmm... A sign maybe? \n\nTGO is a cute, cozy little place off of Atwood Avenue in a charming neighborhood. When our server greeted us, I was immediately put off by the fact that she was wearing a nose ring. Sorry, but I just don't think that's appropriate in the workplace, especially the service industry (call me old-fashioned!) She was friendly though, offered some suggestions and complimented the chef on his abilities. I felt a little more confident that my meal preparation was in good hands...\n\nWhen the meal arrived however, my companion and I were both underwhelmed. We ordered the empanadas and schnitzel, respectively. Very bland, no flavor, small portions, and waaay overpriced. It's as if they just threw our dinner together and forgot to add the seasoning and spices. We both left disappointed, which was frustrating considering we had driven around quite a while and worked up an appetite. We won't be back."
1,"I honestly love Blue Martini - they have some insane Martinis (fly me to the moon anyone?!), their appetizers are insane and if your a chick and a member of their ladies only club you get a coupon for a free martini! Service has always been top notch and they have live music which is a plus!"
1,"The only reason I'm giving Barriques 5 stars is that it will always have a special place in my heart, since I pretty much lived here during the last 4 months of my PhD dissertation writing.  \n\nAnd there was nothing better than writing straight for 7 hours, downing 5 cappuccino skim extra shot and soup for lunch, then rewarding yourself for doing such a good job with a glass of wine at 7pm.  Yes.  This was my pattern for the aforementioned time period.\n\nAlso, coffee shops should realize that (besides having a liquor license) PEOPLE NEED OUTLETS for their laptops.  Barriques has listened to our plea, and not only has outlets every other table, but has extension chords with multiple outlets also, leaving everyone with extra choice of outlets.\n\nComfy chairs, rustic tables, loft style open layout makes this place inviting.\n\nOf course, what sucks is that everyone knows about it, and if you go after 11am, the place is packed.  This of course, forced me to get up earlier and write more... So good for them!!"
0,"To be honest, Le Bremner was somewhat of a letdown. We got a late dinner reservation on a Wednesday evening at 9:15p. After being seated it was about 20 minutes before my server greeted me and offered to take my drink order. There were a few other tables seated but it was not by any means full. It took another15 minutes for me to actually get my cocktail - the server said the bartender was backed up. We ordered the tuna and tahini, the porchetta w Kim chee, the burrata salad, the fried quail, and the shrimp and lobster BLT. All were highly praised by our server. We asked for her assistance with ordering as we're visiting from out of town. The tuna and tahini was actually very good. An interesting combo with what I think is fried kataifi for texture. Silky, crunchy, Tasty! Then it was downhill from there. The porchetta and Kim chee was meh. Kim chee is very trendy and I should know better by now than to order anything with it. It was an ok but somewhat disparate dish. The burrata salad was bland - needed acid and/or salt. The tomatoes lacked peak flavor. The fried quail was good though not mind blowing. The cheese on the BLT unfortunately overpowered everything else in that dish. We had the coffee pot de crime. Again, just so so. And wine was $15 per glass so a $250 meal that was disappointing. I guess I had high expectations because I'm a Chuck Hughes fan. I'm sure it's his menu but it all comes down to execution. I understand that there are many raves about Le Bremner but I unfortunately did not have that experience. Still a fan but cannot recommend Le Bremner based on my one experience."
0,Not the same as Famiglia in NYC AND double price. Tasted like some typical hotel-cantina dog-food-flavored Sbarro.
1,"Like everyone else who booked this through Priceline, I wasn't aware of the resort fee until \""after\"" I booked it, but I have to say for paying a total of $68/night this place was way more than I expected! It was a beautiful resort and I loved our comfy bedroom and 42 inch flat screen tv. We never took advantage of the fitness center, tennis or bicycles but we enjoyed the pool! Sangria's bar was pretty cool and average prices for food/drinks. The breakfast buffet was a rip off but we took advantage of the 2 for 1 coupon. My husband enjoyed all the golf courses nearby and I had fun checking out the outlet malls! The resort was very clean and staff were friendly!"
0,"It is rare for me to pen a bad review on any restaurant, however this one needs to know how horrible their service is.  \n\nAfter ordering online, I decided to pick up (or carry out) the pizza since I was relatively close by.  \n\nWhen I entered the store I was immediately greeted by the staff member behind the cash register.  He asked if I was \""carrying out\"" an order and I said \""yes\"" and gave him my name.  He looked puzzled while scanning the screen and asked my name a second time. Again i gave him my name to which he responded with somebody else's name.  I said no and a third time gave him my name.  He then said \""ohhhhh, there you are man....sorry.\""\n\nHe told me the price and I gave him cash.  He then gave me the change and closed the cash register. At the same time, another customer entered the store behind me.  The staff member immediately greeted the second customer and asked for his name to look up an an order. I interrupted him and said \""may I have my pizza now please?\""  And he said \""in a second, I want to help this customer first.\"" Puzzled, I said, \""excuse me? I just paid you and my pizza is behind you on the rack.\"" And he said, \""yes, but let me take this guy's order first...\""  I stopped him short and said, \""wouldn't it be best to complete service with the first customer (me) before you begin on a second customer?\""  He responded, \""um, oh yea man....I see.  Here's your pizza.\""\n\nI took the pizza from his hands and looked at the second customer behind me who shrugged his shoulders as I walked out the door.  To top everything off, the box was cold and so was the pizza inside.\n\nThis bad personal customer experience now tells me I will never order from here again.  Sad, and I really liked their pizza...when it's warm at least."
1,I went in with a groupon deal and boy will I be back ! Ali managed to give my hair some body and it actually stayed like that for HOURS ! Will definitely go back again :)
1,I haven't been back in a long while and was glad we tried it out again. \n\nThe BF got a waffle breakfast and I a waffle sandwich. The waffles were perfectly crunchy but very fluffy inside so it was light and not dense/carb-y like what I equate some waffles and pancakes to be. You can do meal combos now so the price for a waffle with a beverage is about $7 which I think is real reasonable. Sandwiches came with some chips and the breakfast came with egg and sausage or bacon. \n\nPlus is we aren't morning people so those breakfast exclusive places normally close when we are just getting up. We can come here later in the afternoon and have ourselves some brekkie.
1,"On our Arizona Brewpub adventure, we hit the Phoenix area just after \""typical lunch\"" time to sit down in Chandler and enjoy a flight of their 5 tap beers.  Space has a fun vibe, an outdoor patio with some good music * sacks of hops in the dining room and the brewing equipment right next to the bar.\n\nHusband is enjoying the hoppy selections of beer while I am pretty excited about the Bear Wallis Berliner Weisse Grapefruit.  Light but tart - instant fan here.  Oaked-n-Ordinary bitter light wood casked - was really great too.\n\nService was cheerful,  rosemary on the fries made catsup completely unnecessary   House salad with chicken - which seemed like an afterthought on the menu, was fresh and satisfying.  Burger rocked.\n\nBobby sat down with us an helped us make a plan of attack for more Phoenix.  Thanks Bobby!"
1,"Gelato Spot's ample seating and abundant selection make it a viable option for escape from deathly Arizona heat.\n\nThe gelato is on the creamier end of the creamy-icy scale.  Both the Coffee and Cookies & Cream (my favorite dessert flavors) tasted plentifully strong, coexisting wonderfully in a crisp, fresh waffle cone.  The gelato also admirably withstood melting, indicating a high-quality product unexpected at a chain.\n\nWould revisit if in the area!"
1,"I LOVE LOVE Poke express! Especially the mussell poke. If you're looking for more than just Ahi poke, then this is the place. Not only do they have about 5 or 6 different kinds of Ahi poke, they have tako, opihi (top shelf), mussels, yummy goodness! The staff is super friendly with great pigeon accents and if you are weary, they let you sample some first before buying. I usually buy two or three kinds for myself and end up chowing down on them as soon as I step out the door. \n\nThe only downside is the store hours. I wish they were longer for those night cravings, but still five stars!"
1,"I am glad to have found this place. I am not one who writes reviews but this is one that I must.\nIf you are looking for an alternative to avoid drugs with lots of side effects, try this Chinese doctor and his herbs.\nI had stomach pain on and off for three months now and finally something told me to go check this place.\nThe first night I took the concoction I felt a relief and soothing and calming effect.\nYou have to let him know if you are taking any medication though so he knows what to prescribe and advise."
0,I gave them a 2 the pizza was a 5 however the lady working the register had a attitude and was the most rude person I have ever encountered at a restaurant I had lunch there yesterday also and she was the same way so because of this I will not be back.
0,"Although the atomsphere was nice and quait, the wait time for a meal was long.  It took almost 40 minutes to get our food after we order it.   Also, I had the chicken quesadilla the chicken was so dry and overcooked I had to chew for ever to break it up.  I would not reccomend getting the grilled onions on it, makes it soggy"
1,It is a older hotel so you don't think of going there for the buffet right of the bat.  We somehow ended up here and the buffet was pretty good.  Not the largest selection but of what they offered everything was good quality (that's what really matters).  I was pleasantly surprised.  Would definitely go back.
0,Very loud and crowded atmosphere. Tables are almost stacked on top of each other. Very over priced for so-so Mexican food(Tacos/Enchiladas/Taquitos.....). Portion sizes are very small. 14.00 drinks. The service was also terrible. There are many other options in Vegas. I would not recommend this establishment. The best part of the experience was the Management!
0,"Went to  Chino Bandito last week and have some complaints. First, I must say the service was excellent. Our first time and the guy working the tasting bins was awesome. Let us try everything we wanted and helped place our orders like a champ... But that's where the good times stopped. We took our order to go... It was a mistake.\n\nMy girlfriend ordered the teriyaki chicken and white rice. Her bowl was put together sloppily and had little sauce to flavor the bland unseasoned chicken. The rice wasn't even warm when we made it the two blocks back to our apartment.\n\nI ordered a large or two meat bowl... I asked for the Jen Red pork and Pollo Diablo with pork fried rice and black beans. I didn't get any pork... Neither the Jen Red nor in the fried rice. I think I got the pollo diablo chicken, but it was mostly chopped green onion, loads of garlic, pepper seeds, and enough oil to leave a couple tablespoons in the bowl when all else was removed. There was also a cheese quesadilla in the bowl that I didn't order... There seemed to be twice as much white rice in my girlfriend's single bowl as I was given (on top of getting meatless pork fried rice). The half of the quesadilla that wasn't dripping in oil was good, according to my girlfriend... \n\nI ate most of what I was given, though my girlfriend told me it was a bad idea... She was right. I ended up with indigestion the likes of which I haven't experienced before. For the next 12-16 hours I was afraid I'd gotten food poisoning. After taking two zantac 150s, three alkaseltzer, and a handful of tums, I was able to sleep... Then awoke two or three times to rush to the bathroom.\n\nI know it was only our first time... But I'd be insane to return. After hearing about this restaurant and tasting all those great tasters, I was hoping to be a loyal consumer."
1,"Loved this place!  Most people who have been to Vegas numerous times don't even know about it.  We just happened to be staying at a hotel nearby and drove by it several times and it was also recommended in Frommer's.  What fun!  Great food - we chose the appetizer sampler which included variety of sausages, sauerkraut, potato salad and pretzels.  Yum!  We also had apfelstrudel for dessert.  There was live entertainment and we were lucky enough to be there at the same time as a bachelor party which made the atmosphere at 2:00 in the afternoon very boisterous!  We totally enjoyed it and loved finding a place off the strip that was so fun and had good food, too."
1,"Great selection, reasonable prices, and clean.  My go to for dumplings, red bean, and seaweed fix."
0,"The food was ok, we ordered dinners but got ala carte, I don't think the waiter spoke English, it was just ok, the place needs a good cleaning."
1,"Not Bad , But averaged $1.15 per WING !!! \n Nice selection of flavors , kinda greasy but good. I ordered the louisiana licker sauce. ( you know , something different ) And i ate too damn many. now my tummie hurts ! LOL"
0,"How can Kai do it so right upstairs and Kosin do it so wrong?  The mac and cheese and short rib were awesome but the salads, salmon, and service were so bad.  We have been to Kai and loved it so many times and always thought we should try Kosin.  Never again.  It's unreal the difference between the two restaurants.  Seriously the service was horrendous.  Have you no idea how to clear a plate, bring new silverware, refresh drinks, bring the app before the salad, etc?  We couldn't even get water for 20 minutes.  Is this real life?  It's a 1 star experience for the money if you don't order the mac and cheese and short rib."
1,The hamburger was amazing! I was a bit concerned about the condiments not being refrigerated on a wagon car but the food still blew me away. I ordered a classic. My daughter had a hot dog and it came on a hamburger bun which was interesting. My husband had the bacon one and it looked amazing. I will totally be back.
0,I lived in Albuquerque for four years and really miss the food.  I met a guy who lived in Santa Fe who recommended this place.  The worst place in ABQ was better than this and would cost a third of what they charged here.  I got the red and the green chile.  Both were unpleasant--the red tasted burnt.
0,"If there was a zero, I would have used it. They strong arm you so bad before you get the wash, that I just left.. The guy kept hammering at me to upgrade everything and  finally I said\""how about I just turn around and leave?\""  He didn't say anything so that's exactly what I did and have never returned since."
1,"The Bank nightclub in the Bellagio Hotel and Casino is one of the first and most respected clubs in the Las Vegas nightlife scene, and remains a favorite for tourists, VIPs, event celebrators and industry professionals. \n\nA night at The Bank can be described as a sensory overload, filling your ears with beats from music from famous DJs that you won't be able to resist dancing to, and the decor is accented with black and gold. On Sunday nights, industry professionals fill the club to enjoy a legendary weekly dance party.\n\nHit the dance floor and see why the crowd dresses to impress and flocks to The Bank to drink, dance and party in style every weekend. They come for the music and good times, but keep coming back for the exceptional hospitality and service."
0,"I've been back to Quiet Storm many times. I can accept the hit or miss service since it's pretty cheap and casual. That's not really an excuse for bad service, it only somehow softens the blow, but why be mediocre? \n\nThe environment is comfortable (unless you sense the servers don't want you there). The music ranges and is appropriate for the environment. It's never too loud or aggressive. Free wi-fi helps and the milkshakes are slammin! The food is inconsistent, but often good. The Black-a-dilla is my favorite. \n\nI really want to like Quiet Storm, but it only merits 2 stars. Their food, service, and hours are inconsistent. It seems they often close early. \n\nOwners, please stick to your business hours. It's not like you're open that late to begin with! Perhaps everybody wants to go home, I don't blame them for that, and you may have run out of a few things, but try to imagine the disappointment of trekking out there to enjoy your favorite shake or snack and then being turned away.  \n\nOR, If you believe this is an acceptable business practice, it would be less infuriating if you simply changed your hours to '9am - until we feel like it.'  This way there are no set expectations and we can't really begrudge you for it. \n\n...My vote is to just stick with the hours you created.\n\nThanks!"
0,"Booked a discount cab online, received a confirmation number, 5 minutes after it was booked I called to get an ETA. There order was confirmed but per the agent/dispatcher there was no cab on the way. I asked that they hurry a cab to my location because I needed to get to work, I was given a time frame of 5 to 20 minutes. (this is the predigested pap they spread whenever you ask an eta... but I believed her) Twenty five minutes later, No cab. Called again, got apologies but when pressed for a real time was told 15 to 20 MORE minutes. Taxi finally arrived after the time I was supposed to login, and I finally was able to arrive LATE for work (which I do detest). So, to reprise; 1) Online Booking failed 2) speaking to a live customer service agent/dispatcher did not resolve the situation - it made things worse 3) The CS agent was polite but ineffective in getting any sort of resolution that may have helped the situation and finally 4) It will be a snowy day here in Phoenix before I use this shoddy, ineffective and at times hazardous taxi service ."
0,I don't think I've had such a awful experience at any restaurant  in my life. Mind you this happened on my birthday. I go to order some wings to go and while I wait I decide to grab a drink. Well at the end of my drink I notice in the corner of my eye something brown in my drink and to my surprise I find a dead roach in my drink. It was the most disgusting feeling I've ever felt. I wouldn't recommend this place to my worst enemy. I'm to the point I don't even wanna eat at any restaurant  again. Such a awful experience be aware of this place
1,"Once upon a time a young Australian named Scott ventured to a far off land named Las Vegas. Scott had heard tales of magical machines that sometimes, but rarely gave you money if you pushed buttons on them for long enough. Scott heard of ladies that wore very little and drinks that were very large. He also heard tales of burgers the size of a small child and it became his quest while in this strange land to track down, and devour one of these famed burgers.\n\nNot deterred by the reviews of a mixed nature to be found on the magical tome known as Yelp, Scott set his sights on the Heart Attack Grill. Neon signs beckoned him forth. Posters in the windows told him that alcohol was good for him. Scott agreed. He stepped through the doors, with his beloved (and vegetarian) wife in tow, and was promptly greeted by a young lady in a nurses uniform. This was not like any nurse Scott had seen before. Nurses dressed in such skimpy attire in the strange land of Vegas. Upon being greeted Scott was cloaked in a surgical gown that no doubt had magical properties and was led to his waiting table.\n\nThe Grill was quiet, for it was late afternoon on a week day. Scott ordered a Double Bypass burger and when asked if extra bacon would be required Scott answered \""Yes, yes it will\"". Scott's wife, the vegetarian Leisha, simply smiled and ordered a large beverage of an amber liquid known as beer. \n\nBefore too long the burger had arrived. It was as large as the fables had told and Scott was quite pleased, though a little shocked. Scott was not expecting the food in this strange place to be of what looked to be good quality. The fries looked crisp and brown and tasted slightly of lard. Lard is good.\n\nThe burger glistened in the light. Scott looked around the room at the images on the wall that parodied films of yesteryear and smiled, then picked up the weighty burger with two trembling hands and took his first bite. It was good. Very good. Surprisingly good actually. This challenge would be a welcome one with such delicious treats on offer. Leisha asked Scott how his burger tasted as she sipped from her mammoth beer. \""Delicious\"" was Scott's reply through mouthfuls of juicy meat before diving back in. \n\nBefore too long Scott was halfway through his burger and he was beginning to falter. But Scott's will was strong. He could not return to his home in Australia letting this challenge best him, so he bunkered down and dove back in. The burger was rapidly decreasing in size, as Scott felt he was rapidly increasing in size. And then, with one almighty fist pump the final bite was downed and Scott was victorious. He was elated.\n\n\nAfter an appropriate resting time Scott rose to his feet and felt several kilograms heavier as he waddled to the door and the outside world with a grin on his face and a cow in his stomach. Victory was his, but it was not the poor gentleman's who was currently bent over a table being spanked by a nurse."
0,"You're disappointing me Aliante!!!\n\nThis is an update to my previous review.  My first review of Aliante is 4 stars and at times, even 5 stars.  However, my recent visits here have not been good.  \n\nHere are the recent issues\n-No longer a Station Casino.  This means none of my Great Giveaway Bets qualify here.  As a result, I make my way to Red Rock weekly.  \n\n-Rewards Center:  Poor service right now.  Since this is now it's own casino, I have to update my Rewards Card.  The table games no longer issues cards so I'm only able to get a new card at the Reward Center.  They only have one and their lines were super long.  I know it was a weekend, but when you see that many people in line, 2 employees will not cut it.  Was in line for about 30 minutes, then finally gave up.  I didn't even make it halfway.  Also, I don't plan on playing here much anymore so no reason to get a Rewards Card.\n\n-Poker Room Closed:  Yes, even on the weekend.  C'mon man!!\n\n-Sports Book Bar:  I live close to here and use to sit at the bar to check out the games, play a little video poker, and have a drink.  Only issue...tough to get a drink when no one serves you. There could be bartenders in the bar, but never check on you.  And if you ask them for a drink, they state that someone else has to do it.  How hard is it to open a bottle of Budlight and hand it over?  Seriously??!!\n\nI'm think that Aliante is in a transaction between owners, which is also causing the lack or consistent customer experience.  I will try again since I live so close.  I might have caught the Rewards Center, Bar, Poker Room, and Johnny Rockets all on a bad night."
0,"I've only been a member for 2 weeks.  I am temp in AZ from CO caring for a terminally ill family member.  I needed a place to escape for relief. MSF is close.  I joined to attend yoga and pilates classes. 2 out of the 5 times I have gone to class there has been a mixup in the schedule.  Wed I noticed the online sched differed from the paper sched.  I called to find out the correct time and was given the wrong info.  Waiting with several other confused members for the class to begin, one of the said \""the yoga schedule has been jacked up lately\"".  It's not easy for me to get away.  I have to hire home health care every time I leave the house.  I needed an outlet to relieve stress and get some exercise. MSF has provided the opposite.  To add to the so far awful experience, the front desk employees could care less.  AND I paid to attend a meditation class and realized I was charged 5.00 too much.  After I had to wait 20min to sign up and pay because no one at the front desk had any idea what I was requesting!  I had to direct them to the huge sign advertising the class outside the yoga room instructing to sign up and pay at the front desk.  Now I will need to spend more time and frustration trying to get my 5.00 back.   Needless to say I will be re-joining the wonderful PEORIA BIKRAM YOGA studio even though it is a long drive.  Anyone looking for mind/body classes for stress and exercise.....join a REAL yoga studio!"

1,"This is a updated review I posted back on 8/1/2013\n\nWe hear all the time that Tom's BBQ is a great place. My wife now and I decided to give this place a second try with the hope of maybe service, food, management, has changed.\n\nService, food, and the atmosphere of the restaurant was great. Last time my wife and I went, the restaurant was dead and service was terrible. There was a huge difference on our second visit. Don't know what happen and don't care what happened but we had a great experience.\n\nThe wife and I ordered pulled pork sandwiches. Ordered a basket of curly fries wasn't greasy like the last time. Very tasty and filling. Definitely recommend it. Pecan Pie is tasty as well.\n\nPresentation of our dishes were awesome. Our server was great. Pricing on the food is fair and portion of food served is awesome.\n\nDefinitely will recommend this place to get some good grub with the hope that no one will ever have the experience I had when my wife and I went."
0,"Honesty... That's the #1 thing to look for when getting your vehicle repaired. Coulter Nissan will lie to your face to make a quick buck, and is the epitome of why people distrust and therefore hate car repair shops.  \nI took my Armada in when the rear A/C stopped blowing. \nI paid $80 for diagnosing the problem, was then quoted approx $750 to do the repair. I balked at the price, quickly decided I would do the repair myself to save a bit.\n-Lie #1: \""Your rear blower motor is shot\""\n-Lie #2: \""We removed the rear panel an tested, there is power going to the rear motor\""\n-Lie #3: When I balked at the price, they \""realized\"" they had mistakenly quoted me double the price for a new blower motor. \n-Lie #4: Was quoted 4 hours of labor to remove and replace the rear blower motor (at $150 per hour) (Ok Not technically a lie, just an overinflated estimate supposedly directly from Nissan, it took me about 2 hours to do it with improper tools. I I had to do it again it would take 1 hour)\nSo I purchased a new blower motor online, took the car part, installed the new one, to my surprise it did not fix the problem. I then tested the motor I took out, worked perfectly, and tested the connection, there's no power going the the motor! \nI'm convinced they got busy and just quoted me the most expensive possible fix, if I agreed then they would actually figure out the real problem. (And still charge me the full price of course) I'm not sure what other explanation there could be?! The mechanic even told me to my face exactly what he tested, and it was complete lies!\nI then took it to a different nissan dealer, explained what haopened, which diagnosed it correctly. I bought the part online and fixed it myself for a total of $5.00, the plastic had broken inside one of the knobs that controls the A/C, and it now works perfectly. \nOne last note very peculiar note: I dropped off the vehicle initially, my FRONT a/c worked perfectly. I picked up the vehicle from Coulter Nissan, and my FRONT A/C motor died on the way home (I live 2 miles away) I did take it back and discussed this with them, and gave them the benefit of the doubt and chalked that up to a nearly impossible coincidence, but since learning the rest of the story, I just don't know. \nDon't trust this dealer to ever work on your vehicle. Even if they correctly diagnose a problem, (which they wont) their labor estimates are inflated 400% over how long they actually take. \nI tell you what, loan me a GTR for a week and we'll call it even, you know who I am. Aside from that, I will not be back, and likely never go to any nissan dealer anywhere ever again.\nHonesty... Is it really so freaking hard?!"
0,"This place was alright. We came here on a Saturday afternoon. It was semi-full but there was a lot of people waiting on to-go orders. I pictured this place more bar and less restaurant. It was the opposite. \nthey had several TV's and my pet-peeve. NO VOLUME why even have a tv in the 1st place? \nOMG if you've read my reviews you know that is a deal killer for me. and I'll end up somewhere else. \nWe ordered wings and 2 salads. This must have annoyed this waitress b/c we never saw her again? she spent the ENTIRE time kissing the next table's ass. .and I mean giggling like a teenager at everything this table's patrons had to say, and would by pass us like nothing. \nmy bf finally said I guess my empty glass is invisible?  I figured it must have been. When we finally did get her attn and flagged her down to get the check - her whole tone changed. I guess the high pitched giggly tone and helpful attitude was reserved only for certain tables and ours wasnt up. Maybe we didnt spend enough? \nsorry but I'm only going to order what I'm willing to actually eat. \n\nWINGS: The wings were ok. we ordered HOT and garlic cilantro. The garlic cilantro had ZERO flavor. I was really disappointed b/c I like both A LOT. garlic is up there w/ salt & pepper in my household. The hot good though, but they were very very very VERY greasy. I think i used every napkin in the place. more napkins than BWW or HOOters cant be good in the calorie dept. and the taste wasnt that far above and beyond so IMHO the nxt time I go I'll probably try something else, and maybe get it to go to avoid bad waitressing."
0,Shitty ass fries man!
0,"EVERYTHING is sooooo expensive! And that would be fine if they put fish on your rolls. All we got were rolls of rice with stains of pink which they tried to pass off as tuna rolls. After me and one other spent 75 dollars for mini rice rolls, we went and got some burgers. Don't go to this stupid place."
0,"The food is good but the service is bad. Two hours, forgot drinks, forgot food, took too long to order after dinner drinks and dessert. Yet they still added a twenty percent tip! WTF! i was only with 6 people. We were very un impressed by the wait staff and servers. Great view, nice atmosphere but won't be back. Too many other great restaurants in the area."
0,"With all the hype Sprinkles gets, my expectations were overpriced (I figured about 6 dollars per cupcake) but really tasty cupcakes.  I was wrong on both accounts.\n\nWe arrived and chose the cupcake line.  There is a separate counter for ice cream and cookies.\n\nI was pleased the prices were reasonable. $3.00 for a cupcake is on par with less trendy shops.   I was disappointed that they did not have most of the flavors which were listed on the wall.  I settled on a raspberry cupcake as the sign said it was a seasonal favorite while my daughter ordered their specialty red velvet cupcake and we also tried their mini chocolate marshmallow for $2.00.\n\nThe chocolate marshmallow cupcake was horrible.  Neither my daughter nor I could finish it and it tasted like a rum based dark chocolate topping with a strong bitterness.  \n\nThe raspberry cupcake was overly sweet but definitely tasted like fresh raspberries were used in the making of the frosting.  I could only handle a small bite of it due to the sweetness.  Unfortunately the cupcake was not moist inside and rather crumbly.  It tasted stale or store bought instead of handmade.   The red velvet cupcake was only slightly moister but when I picked it up, the top came off and the cupcake fell to the ground.  I am all for cupcake tops but this only happens with dry cupcakes. The flavor on the red velvet cupcake was good and this is the only one of the three I would ever try again."
0,"Wow, What a really small place for a restaurant.. They should really think about a bigger place.. I felt like i was in a sardine can.\n\nOn to the food,.  If you love salt go here,. Every dish is loaded with tons of salt! With Heavy grease on the side.. The owner apparently is vietnamese so you can expect very subpar pinoy dishes. There are a lot better pinoy food places in las vegas. DT's is probabley the worst filipino food in las vegas. Fiesta Filipina on st Rose and Eastern is the closest to real pinoy dish i have found in las vegas."
0,i liked  the food but after a hangover who won't eat anything! great place for hangover not have when sober. great place to people watch that's for sure!
0,"Ok, So like every girl I like my Nails Did and so I usually have my usual nail lady (For a reason) Ladies you all know Once  you find her KEEP her...don't cheat..like I did..\n\nLet's get to the Good stuff, It was the day before  4th of July, my nails needed to be re done, BAD... wanted to look you know, Good for the holiday.\n\nOk so finally after going to three different salons (in PHX near my work) that by the way were Jammed packed, I decided to go to one near me (TMP) aaand just so you all know I read reviews, before I buy, or try anything!!!! Just saying...I wanted to try and see for myself...\n\nThe Good?? They had working A/C, It was not packed, and the atmosphere was relaxing..quiet. So Anyway at this point I was like JUST GET ME A GEL Manicure!!! I forgot to ask for colors they had...the price for their Mani..(usually pay $25) and...yeah...so it went like this..\n\nI sat down, tired..hot...the nice man sits in his chair...files my nails SHORT  with a USED square file thingy...ew..(grrrr..btw Im trying to grow my nails....sir) then finally finishes and I then asked for Colors...I wanted Hot Pink..for the Summer..you think he had it? NOPE. \n\nI had to pick this ugly pink..(no Color Variety) then he only applied two thin coats!!! Like whaatttt??? (Oh it gets BETTER) It was finally done...he had been going back and forth with another customer..so I felt unattended at times..but he did ok and finished in a timely matter I guess...So I get up to Pay and Guess what...\n\nLady was like \""$35.00 Dollah\"" O_o I was like \""$35.00?!!\"" ...she asked \""Would you like for me to charge $35.00 Even?\"" I was like...(in my head) \""Really? did you want a tip and some ice-cream with that too?!!! LOL Oh wow...if I knew it was gonna cost me that I would of been like I need two more Coats of Polish please!!!! \n\nI was Dissappointed....What a waste of $...Never Again."
0,I was really exited to try the place at first and plan to go back again because i have to believe what I experienced was unusual. The thing that really drew me to this place was the tallow appetizers. However when I went they were not serving that. It was a Friday happy hour and the whole reason I went was taken off of the menu. However I understand that sometimes ingredients run out and whatever excuse they may have had for its absence I will accept. Furthermore decent happy hour drink specials helped alleviate the problem.\nWhat i could not accept is that I had the single worst service of my life. This is sort of a hipster joint and I have never met a man that had more apathy to his job quality. I was at a table with five people and we saw so little of him it was comical. As this was a small bar and really not busy it was inexcusable.  After waiting for 20 minutes we finally asked him if would could order food at which point he said yes and then simply walked away for another 15 minutes before taking our order. The only thing worse than this mans service was his ridiculous mutton chops.\nI really hope this is not a typical experience at this place as decent food and drink specials could make this a very nice bar if the service was even remotely respectful.
0,"In town for business, I picked this place based on other's reviews.  It was strange to be in an Americanized Thai Restaurant.  I've always had the best experiences in traditional, shopping center or strip mall Thai spots but thought since I was in Scottsdale, I would try mainstream and wasn't impressed.  \n\nI order the veggie summer rolls with smoked tofu (which I've never seen on a menu), thinking it would be nice to try something new.  The portion size was good, however, it was mostly glass noodles and lettuce with once slim piece of tofu and minimal carrots.  The peanut hosin sauce was pretty good, but tasted of BBQ sauce more than peanut.\n\nI chose the Arizona Heatwave as my main entree with fried tofu and medium hot.  The spicyness of the dish was pretty good however, there was more curry sauce than anything else in the bowl.  I'm accustomed to getting large chunks of peppers, onions, bamboo shoots and carrots but there were hardly any vegetables besides celery.  Tofu was plentiful but I ordered the dish for the veggies.\n\nI'm thinking I may have gone here on an off night because the meal didn't live up to my expectations based on other's experiences."
1,"I hardly ever give 5 stars, but this place definitely deserves it! I just had the best Mexican food at this joint and it was spicy as hell. We had no clue this place cooked everything super spicy, but that's exactly how I love my food so I was super duper happy. They bring you chips and 2 different salsas to start (red chili and salsa verde) and they are both spicy with chunks of chili peppers in them. We told the manager how much we loved the salsas and he went on to tell us how everything they make is from scratch, including the tortillas. I ordered the taco and red chili cheese enchilada platter with rice and beans. I'm a hard critic when it comes to enchiladas and they are super authentic and delicious here! Be warned though: the beans and the red chili sauce are really really really spicy! I wasn't expecting that kind of heat in the beans and I'm definitely paying for it right now as I type, but it was sooooo worth it. I'm a true fan and will definitely return very soon!"
1,"Stayed for 2 nights in the worlds second largest hotel. We opted to stay in the executive king suite. It wasn't really much more than a standard room. It was great! We had a nice, very spacious room with a great view. I especially like the automatic blinds and decor. It was very clean and comfortable. They also have free internet, but at 1mb, it's a little slow at times. Enjoyed the room and the casino very much. We will be back!"
1,"Based on the current promotions (30% off services), I visited their salon. I have been to other salons before, but I felt that my manicurist (forgot her name) really cared about my nails. She showed me how to take care of them better. She took her time, and listened to what I wanted my nails to be like.\n\nOther things I noted:\n\n- So Clean\n- Sometimes they actually speak English in front of the customer\n\nTruly a five star place that I would come back to again."
0,"I'd never eat here again, even if they paid me to.\n\nBeing a born-and-raised Mainah, I was really craving some fish and chips. My brother was in town and we went together. When we received the food we were appalled. The \""fish\"" was literally just a thin, overcooked patty that was quite obviously a pre-made frozen food. \n\nThe fries, scallops and shrimp were the same. Factory-made frozen food that they heat and serve. \n\nLiterally, that's it. They just open a bag, heat it up, and serve it. They don't prepare anything here. \n\nOh, and if you want sauce? They charge extra."
1,OOOOOOOOHHHHHH!!!! Best barbecue I have had apart from a specific food truck in Nashville!!
0,"My food experience was just so strange and terrible at the same time. The breadsticks reminded me of Fazoli's.  Anyone remember that place?  Remember the breadsticks?  Ya, they were stale, dry, and overly absorbent of the saliva inside my mouth.  They were not, however, rock hard, so I consider the breadsticks a wash.  \nThe salad was heavy on the onions, easy on the ANYTHING ELSE.  I've never seen an onion salad before but I would imagine that Olive Garden could make one without much extra effort.  I don't understand why they don't do dressing either.  Maybe they do and there was just too little on it, but the salad was dry.  So the salad was a fail.  \nFor the soup, I went with the Chicken & Gnocchi.  By chicken they mean \""chicken broth\"" and by gnocchi they mean \""ball of flour dough\"".  This was more like wanton soup than anything else.  It didn't taste horrible, just cheap...so only a minor fail.  \nI'm still alive, so I did better than I expected.  I figured the worst thing that could happen would be if I got horribly sick and had to take paid time off for a week...that didn't happen either...so another fail.\n\nThe whole experience is what got me.  We show up to GhettroCentre with 6 people and there are at least 20 waiting around for tables.  That's fine, it is lunch time.  We got a table and our waitress was decent enough.  Group ordered some sort of appetizers (that I did not partake of).  They brought our drinks.  We ordered our meals.  They brought our salads and breadsticks.  Then they brought us one of the apps.  About 10 minutes later she comes by to check on us...and we tell her we still don't have the other app.  She disappears for a while and comes back and says \""we ran out of chicken so it's going to be a while\""... wait what?  You ran out...but you will...what?  Clone some more?  Sub something else?  What are you doing to make more chicken appear?  We decline the app since our meals are arriving any minute.  Food arrives, everything is normal, whatever.  I was only mildly distracted by the weird outdoor christmas light strings they have draped throughout the dining room.  I survived.\n\nMy question is, my soup/salad/breadstick combo was like $6.99.  Everyone else's meals come with salad and breadsticks, right?  So I could have just ordered the $5.34 soup (seriously, that is expensive soup) and noshed on salad and breadsticks without paying for them?  Right?  What is up with that?"
1,I love this place I always come to this one the service is great always nice and funny and more then happy to tip the food is basic dinner food with a not so basic taste fully recommend it for a midnight snack and a good time
0,"Be aware, be very aware of this office's practices.  Be sure to bring two wallets with you, one for paying up front and then another for when they bill you for \""surprise\"" procedures despite the fact that everything, catch that, everything was included up front.  Second, you are lucky if you see (pun intended) the doctor for more than 30 seconds.  Everything in this eye/cataract factory is handled by clerks and techs in training.  I went to another cataract surgeon's office for my other eye and the billing was complete with no surprises and IT WAS LESS.  The doctor was supportive and communicated at length."

This Starbucks location in particular is definitely one of my top three.\nHere's to you Starbucks crew @ Sahara & Ft. Apache!! -B"
0,Terrible urgent care. Took over 2 hours to be seen.  When we arrived there were only 4 people in the waiting room.

Maybe this isn't the norm?
0,"For a five start hotel i was disappointed, better off staying at Wynn or Bellagio.\n\nPluses: \nRooms very spacious and very nicely decorated\n\nMinuses:\n- Staff constantly ignored the do not disturb sign, a pet peeve - especially in a 5 star hotel\n- LOTS of outside noise from rail line.  clearly no double glazing \n- Not a lot of hotel amenities\n- Pool closes at 8\n- Too far to walk to the strip, and not a safe walk at night, no lighting and no sidewalk for most of it\n- very limited room service menu (and a little over priced)\n- no 24 hr room service (again .. this is meant to be a 5 star hotel)"
1,"Super, duper friendly boutique smack dab in Cosmopolitan!\n\nFor some reason, I'd never been here before.  But, I'm glad I did, because they have a very cute selection of clothing, shoes, jewelry, and even Jonathan Adler home goods.\n\nBrands noticed were Helmut Lang, A.L.C., Opening Ceremony, and 10 Crosby Derek Lam.  So, they're more on the contemporary side, less on the cutesy side.  I like that!\n\nWhen I checked on the store, they had a pretty big sale item section where everything was 50% off.  I ended up getting a Jonathan Adler ceramic piece for $20 -- a really great price.  They also had some other quirkly home stuff like the book \""All my friends are dead\"" and \""The Quotable Douchebag.\""    I like this buyer's taste!\n\nI will definitely check out this place again when I have more time."

The chairs were just ridiculous. The olds, just meant more talking during the movie.\n\n Also the arm rests are awful! They are concave and hardly padded at all, in between hard plastic edges!!! So it feels like you are resting your arm on bones.\n\nAnd a minor complaint, the bathrooms don't have a paper towel option to dry your hands, only blowers that blow cold, not warm, air. After a 2 hr movie, in a cold theater, that is not pleasant at all!"
0,"I've been a few times now and I really don't get the appeal.  The place seems a little hodge-podge in their decor, the food isn't very good (not awful, but why go out and spend money on mediocre food?), and the service is pretty slow.  I've tried a couple different dishes and I'd prefer to go to a carry-out place for this type of \""mexican\"" food.  My opinion, don't waste your time or money."

Warm, wonderful owners who are still excited about their trade.    Just go!"

You can tell they really don't care how fast they get your food out.\n\nThey are constantly out of Whoppers especially on SUNDAYS AT LUNCHTIME. Part of me thinks they just don't want to serve people. Whoever is in change of this place needs to be fired. They don't even clean the place.
1,"Ok, maybe I was hungry and swayed by the easy parking, great modern design, nice outdoor eating space, friendly staff and good food. But, who wouldn't give this a 5. What a great way to have a breakfast spot. Walk up to the counter, order, get your own coffee, drinks, condiments, etc, and choose your seat. If your coffee gets low, you just get it. Need more water? It's all right there. How many times at a regular restaurant have you said that you wished you could just refill your own drink yourself, because you would not have to wait? Probably many times or you just got upset. Here you go. \n\nThis place has great modern decor with nice colors and accents. I noticed it right away when we walked in. Not what you would expect from the outside, a pleasant surprise. \n\nThere are menus on the wall and menus up above and printed menus if you want something you can hold to read and choose your fare. We opted for a veggie scramble with zucchini, yellow squash, and hold the onions for me, a Santa Fe Benedict (thanks to all the fantastic yelp reviews) and two coffees. We signed up for a frequent visitor card and even got an extra 10% off. Woohoo, always welcomed. It came to just $20 for the two of us.\n\nWe chose our seats, near a power outlet so that I could charge my phone, and got comfortable. I made a trip to the restroom to find a very upscale modern bathroom that I was quite impressed by. Not necessarily fitting of a breakfast spot, but totally appropriate with all the other modern decor. \n\nOur breakfast seemed to take a little while, but looked great when it arrived. The quantity of food seemed pretty good for the price and everything looked and tasted very fresh. I was very pleased with my choice of veggie scramble and thoroughly enjoyed it. SG loved his benedict and I even got to sample it. Not being a poached egg fan, I was skeptical, but I got very little yolk in my taste. The sauce was delicious, I definitely understand all the yelp. Both of us enjoyed our coffees and had no problem getting up to refill. Especially since we do not really like our coffees refilled mid cup, it just messes up the chemistry.\n\nThis place is a little tucked away from the freeway and not super convenient to drive to when you are just in town visiting, but its only just under 10 minutes detour for a fantastic breakfast. Well worth it. We will likely be back."
0,"Alright, I know this place is a local legend. I want to give it a higher rating, I really do. But Eddie's place was a big \""meh\"" in my book.\n\nFirst of all, it's trying to accomplish wayyyyy to much. Is it a southern comfort place? A breakfast place? Eclectic American? Bar food? Deli? And why the shit are there potstickers on the menu?\n\nAs for the food, I ordered the shrimp and cheese grits, which were very good. Possibly the mildest grits I'd ever had. It came with a salad that was substantial and included bacon. So far, so good. Some friends ordered the she-crab soup, which was tasty, especially with a bit of sherry.\n\nHowever, a friend ordered the potato skins, which were completely lacking for flavor. Couldn't taste cheese, potato, or even sour cream. Just grease and carbs. Another friend ordered the reuben. It did not look good: greasy, with far too little meat.\n\nThe service was friendly, but bumbling. First, the potato skins came out as potstickers. Strike one. Then they added $1.50 to my tab because I asked for spinach in my salad. Seriously? First of all, spinach is not that fucking expensive. And secondly, you couldn't even put that in the fucking menu? Or explain to me that it cost extra? I call bullshit. Bullshit x1000.\n\nPrices were high for the food they were serving. Needed to be about 20% less.\n\nThe place loaded up with people as we finished our meal, so we got out of there quickly to make way for the next party. I wanted to shake some of them on the way out and shout, \""Why are you wasting your money here?! Go someplace where you can get consistent food with competent waitstaff!\""\n\nSo, I dunno. Not my cup of tea. Maybe if you can stand dumb servers and you can distinguish between what is good and what isn't on the menu, you'll have a better time."
0,The mint milkshake had no alcohol in it and they wouldn't honor the $7 total rewards price on their menu.  They all seem to know that $8 is the price and admitted the menu is wrong.  I would have given the extra dollar as a tip.\n\nBut I did not detect ANY alcohol in the drink.  Two strikes and your out in my book.  I'll go get a great alcoholic drink over at Serendipity next time.
1,"Lovely. That is the best word to describe this place. Everything about it is lovely: the food, the service, and especially the setting. \n\nI went here for brunch at 11:00 a.m. on Sunday and expected to have a long wait for table (especially since it was a warm and sunny day in January) but we arrived and the place was practically empty. We got to choose our table and enjoy a relaxing meal. \n\nThe service was fantastic. From the complimentary valet, the hostess, our waiter, and busser. They were all professional, courteous, and attentive without being pushy. \n\nWe both really liked our food, starting with the banana bread they bring to your table. He went with the steak and eggs (that come with poached eggs on a corn muffin with hollandaise sauce...good lord) and I opted for the three egg omelet minus the shrimp (corn, peppers, spinach, cheese) and they both came with their potatoes (sweet and regular, cubed and seasoned). It was presented well, tasted great, and left us feeling full but not heavy. \n\nNow, all of that is fine and good...but what you should really come here for is the setting. We sat in the outside courtyard and it was just so picturesque (it reminded me a lot of the Arizona Inn in Tucson). Southwesterny without being over the top, brick patio, lots of trees, colorful flowers, fountains, and green grass. \n\nI think this would be a great place for brunch, date night, dinner with your family, rehearsal dinner, and even small wedding. I would also love giving the Hermosa Inn a whirl because it looks very charming."
1,"Had one of my favorite breakfasts ever here while in Scottsdale last week!!!\n\nVery filling bowl of steak, eggs, and veggies... Since switching to the Paleo diet, eating out often leaves me unsatisfied but I could barely finish this breakfast and the taste was a 10 out 10!!!\n\nI strongly recommend for the healthy, on-the-go crowd."
0,its ok.  visited on a tuesday night.  had the chicken fried rice... chicken dry.  egg rolls were good with the right amount of spice but the rest of the family's meal which was a bit of everything was all in all nothing different or unique than any Thai take out joints.  just ok.  service just ok.  price average.  lets just say not memorable.
1,"The sheer number of reviews for Zada Jane's was enough to tempt me to purchase an online deal and venture into Charlotte for some good grub. It proved to be worth the trip as it proved to be a really excellent meal. \n\nThe parking was a little tight, and would have been harder to figure out had it been busier. We arrived at 6pm on a Saturday and the place was a ghost town, which suited us just fine. We got a prime people-watching spot on the patio area and it proved to make for an entertaining meal. The service was well-paced the the hipster waitstaff crew were attentive and friendly.\n\nThe beer selection is composed mostly of bottles, but they consisted of different microbrews which was a plus. After ordering our brews we got a basket of Kool Kip's Nachos...vegeterian style ($7.25) , for an appetizer. Despite the absence of meat, these were some of the best nachos I've ever had, and that says a lot. The roasted squash, peppers, onions and corn, topped with black beans, guac, and sour cream proved to be quite the hearty starter. The blue chips also made a for a solid mode of transportation for the nacho toppings. I would highly recommend going with a plate of nachos if you are grabbing a meal here.\n\nFor dinner I had the Braised Short Ribs ($19.95) and it was out of this world. Now I've been disappointed with dry, grizzly short ribs in the past, but that was not an issue at Zada Janes. These suckers were succulent, tender and delicious, and the portion was mind-boggling. I, Rob B, was only able to eat half the meal and took the other half home for a tastetacular leftover lunch the following day. These mighty short ribs came with these amazing mashed potatoes and cole slaw. Combining a bite of meat, potato and slaw proved to be pure excellence. \n\nThe missus ordered the Wild Mushroom Ravioli ($15) which she really enjoyed. I wouldn't touch those 'shrums myself but she gobbled them down. Her portion was also a bit much and had plenty of leftovers for the following day. The only downside was that the mushrooms were just too oily and rich...someone in the kitchen had a heavy hand with the oil. Hers came with a side salad which was really good for a side salad, with high-quality veggies. She went with the lemon thyme dressing and that was really a winner. If you get a salad here, give that dressing a whirl.\n\nWith all these good eats we simply had no room for dessert, despite how much we wanted to give it a whirl. Zada Jane's proved to be a really good restaurant and we'll definitely be back in the future, without the online deal."
1,"I really enjoy Ago. \n\nWe've been there two times so far.\n\n I always get the Costola di Maiale ai Ferri con Salsetta All'Aglio which is a pork chop cooked to perfection, potato napoleon (THIS IS TO DIE FOR) and spinach. \n\nMy husband had the rosemary rib-eye the first time we went which he thoroughly enjoyed. The second time we went, he ordered the Pappardelle allo Stracotto di Cinghiale which is pappardelle pasta with wild boar stew which was unbelievably tender and tasty.\n\nWe had the same server both times (I believe his name is Vitor). The first time we went we ordered the Antipasto All'italiana which was a platter of cured meats and cheeses as an appetizer. Vitor took the time to explain what every single meat and cheese was. He also went as far as getting us a few glasses of wine that were not on the menu since he knew how much we enjoyed wine. The second time we went we ordered the Prosciutto e Melone which is a platter of prosciutto, melon and ricotta. It was simple yet fabulous.\n\nGreat service. Great people. Fabulous wine and the prices are worth the food. It's nicely decorated yet casual.\n\n Last I checked, restaurant.com had a coupon for Ago. Check it out! You will not be disappointed."
0,"This hotel was very beautiful, and if you are use to being pampered and have a bit of money to throw around then this is totally the place for you!\n\nMy room was beautiful and spacious, as was my bathroom.  The staff around the hotel were also wonderful and helpful.\n\nI did find it a little annoying that despite the lovely decor and all, I didn't have a fridge in my room!  I mean, there was a mini bar (which had everything hooked up to pressure sensors that would automatically charge my room if I even picked up anything), but no place to put anything I brought in myself.  I ended up filling one of my bathroom sinks with ice and keeping my drinks in there for the week.  Not the classiest thing but it worked!\n\nAlso, it is a serious hike to get anywhere in this super confusing hotel, and even more confusing if you ever try to leave it!  It took me and a friend over an hour and directions from 3 different employees to finally get outside the damn place!  I work in a shop and am pretty used to being on my feet and walking most of the day, but this place made that seem like nothing!  Even a few days after being home my feet are still hurting (and no, I wasn't tromping around Vegas in heals, I was wearing sneakers.  I don't even own a pair of heels!)\n\nI would definitely stay here again if someone else was paying the bill.  Next time I'm in Vegas for fun, I think I will try to find something a bit more... casual..."
0,"Rosa's--Just okay.\n\nThe opening chips and salsa was tasty and bottomless, but the salsa was definitely on the sweet side.  The food overall wasn't that bad, but nothing distinctive.  You get a fairly large plate of Mexifood in a pleasant atmosphere and pretty good service, but the taste is only average.  Frankly, there are a LOT of Taquerias, even Filiberto's at times, that have had better tasting grub than this, especially at the prices that they charge.  They don't charge an excessive amount, but dinner for three here cost over $60 with tip.  The taste of the food wasn't commensurate with the price--just to compare, another meal at the Filiberto's drive-thru in Tempe provided a similar amount of food with a better taste for $25.\n\nWorth the 35 extra dollars to eat in?  No.\nRecommended?  No.\nCrappy?  No, but why not get food you really enjoy for less money elsewhere?"
0,Came to watch some Sunday football and enjoy the company of friends. The bar is absolutely freezing colder inside than outside. The waitress had no clue what the current specials for the day were. Placed an order for 10 wings and was given an order of 5. The mens bathroom has no working stalls and the ladies room had no towels for drying your hands. There was a puddle of standing water under an exposed electrical outlet in the hallway leading to the bathrooms. All in all  the meal was mediocre and the rest of noticeable issues makes you wonder whats going on in the kitchen.
1,"I've shopped here for a few years and I do have to agree that the prices are high. The selection is also not that big and the store is small but what other Japanese options do you have in Vegas? If a Marukai opened here this store would not exist, sad to say. But I don't want it to close because it is a great store and the employees are so nice. They have a large DVD selection of Japanese movies and I have bought a few for my son who is 4. I can't even find children Japanese shows or movies on Netflix! They also have a shoppers card that you get stamped when you shop but the rules are insane. You have to spend at least $50 to get a stamp and I think there are about 30+ spots to get stamped. Wow, that's a lot of gohan.\nI do like this store and I hope it stays around for a long time."
1,"I initially came in to lay-away a TREK. They let me make my own terms that catered to my budget. They even tacked on a discount when submitting a payment on Black Friday. \nThey answered all my questions with reasonable knowledge and treated this prior military member with money problems with courteousness. \nIf you want a TREK, I haven't found one shop in the valley with their products."
0,The chicken is alright. The commercial is very misleading because my chicken did not look like the one on TV. The sides were alright and the salsa bar was good until I witnessed a 3 year old girl slobbering all over the spoon and vigorously dipping her infested hands in to the sauce/salsa containers. Very unappealing to say the least. I told the child's mother and the store manager about the blatant condiment violation and they both looked at me with the intent to trick me that they did not speak English. They succeeded because the little girl was still using the salsa bar as her private playground. No salsa for me!!!
1,"Crappy decor , friendly service with a smile and the smell of 1001 spices!!!! Probably the cheapest and best  indian- pakistan dishes out there !!! The mung dhal and the eggplant dish were Outstanding....  Yes I will come again !"
0,"Extremely slow service, forgot my beer, didn't bring soy sauce to the table, food took forever."
0,"Horrible location. Scantily clad waitresses. Slow service. Food was alright but way overpriced (but I guess that's the Vegas theme.) It was trying to be country music's version of Hard Rock Cafe except everything was Toby Keith this, Toby Keith that, for obvious reasons. The longer I sat there, the more I thought Toby Keith was a douchebag for having restaurants focused on himself."
1,"About what you'd pay for sushi at most big cities across the map; 15 sushi rolls to choose from & then an even bigger selection of your normal Asian fusion fare. We only got sushi but the meals served all around us really looked good.  Best sushi roll for us was the Dragon roll with BBQ eel...completely and unexpectedly amazing.  The Crunchy roll was also excellent.  Drinks were of course your $10 minimum so we only got two.  Total bill for two drinks, 3 sushi rolls and a cucumber salad to start (also very good) was about $40 a person. Again, decent price for Vegas compared to all the either super pricey places to eat at.  I'd go back."
0,"Granite City advertised the October Chef's specials.  The Bavarian Burger made me plan a date night just so I could get to try the meal! My fiance and I went to an early dinner.  Our drink orders were taken quickly.  However, that was the end of quick and thoughtful service. I appreciated the Gluten Free menu, my fiance has Celiac.  After placing our order we continued to wait for our drinks which finally arrived about 10 minutes after ordering them- the were delicious, props to the bartender.  Our waitress never asked us about appetizers, which would have been nice since we waited awhile for our entrees-drinking on empty stomachs!  My fiance's GF burger came first.  He awkwardly nibbled at his chips while watching the kitchen for my meal...Finally, my entree came out at least 5 minutes after his meal.  Needless to say, I was let down SO badly about the Bavarian Burger: NO pretzel bun (which our waitress admitted she forgot to mention was out of stock --- umm big part of the burger and an option for ALL burgers on the menu), no mustard, and skimpy kraut.  We scarfed down our meal and left.  Underwhelmed. For the PRICE and the WAIT we didn't get much.  The drinks were the saving factor.\n\nHonestly, there isn't a reason to return."
1,"The Lobster gnocchi was to die for and I really loved the ahi tuna tatare. My friends enjoyede the ny strip, creamed spinach and lobster mash. I finishe my meal with a lovely semillion. The decor is lovely and the service is fair. Go earlier in the evening to miss the bustle and have a quiet meal. If you're at the Bellagio, Fix is definitely worth a visit."
1,"I can only base this on a work event with a limited, \""pick one of these entrees\"" menu. I must say though that it was a good overall experience. I chose a Caesar salad that was properly dressed with a good, garlicky anchoviesque dressing. For my entree, had a grouper filet that was well cooked and served over a risotto with peas, asparagus with a just right, lemony hint to it. Delightful. The service was good and goodness did they ever keep the wine glasses full!  Nice experience all in..."
0,"Howdy Az Foodies\n\nDon't you just love driving down the road scoping out new places and promising to one day try them.... and then  you finally do?\n\nThat's how this review will start... I went to get a burger from a place that used to be a burger shop but apparently is now this mesquite mexican and burger place?\n\nThis piqued my interest.... it's kind of like mixing an italian restaurant with a chinese restaurant...\n\nI go to a mexican restaurant to get mexican food and a burger place to get a burger...but who knows... maybe they do make a good burger?  Never got the chance to find out what any of it tastes like..\n\nIt started like this... I walked in and there was 2 people ahead of me.\n\nA nice man...looked like a manager/owner?.... greeted us and as they took orders found they didnt have the carne adasa or rice therefore they stopped production and went to chop up meat and find rice and no idea what else because we all just stood there waiting while this young female employee stood there looking dumbfounded!\n\nThe beans sat there on the tortillas on the work area waiting for ingrediants to arrive...I should mention at this  time that they took the tortillas out of a grocery store plastic bag!  I was hoping maybe they made their own?\n\nAfter standing in this line 10 minutes I politely said to the dumbfounded girl... \"" I have been waiting too long and I think I will leave\""  I said Thank You and left.\n\nTo be fair I know they opened not too long ago, so i think i will wait a few months until they have their act together to possibly...maybe try again...\n\nNot sure they will be there months from now if they dont made some serious changes.\n\nGood luck to you Julia's....\n\nAnd to the rest of you......\n\nBon Appetite'"
0,I visited the new location on 16th St and Camelback and ordered the carne asada and al Pastor tacos.  The asada was truly tasteless and the lettuce so finely minced it seemed pre-chewed.  The al Pastor was slightly more flavorful when lots of salsa added.  The roasted jalape\u00f1o was served ice cold.  Really terrible experience.
0,We have been here many times but tonight's ayce experience made us think about not going back there again. Food servers acted like they did not want us there. Felt like being rushed out. They missed a couple of our orders on the ayce list.  My last order was the dancing eel. It was not served to us yet and the waitress was already giving us the check. We felt like they wanted us out so we paid and left without getting our last order. Been in the food beverage industry for almost 10yrs. Would never treat my guests this way. Makes me sad since they have really good sushi. I
1,"These sandwiches are awesome. I used to think that a sandwich is just a sandwich, but now I know better.\n\nIt's like an assembly line here. But fresh ingredients, great flavors, and perfectly toasty bread make for one delicious sandwich."

0,"I'm a fan when it comes down to great music in an awesome atmosphere. Of course, Vegas always has something to offer in a lil' city. Great minds think alike when the words of: pool party, vegas, house music, and a combo of inebriated drunkards basking in the sun while sipping on endless amount of booze come into play!\n\nMarquee is deemed to be THE spot to pool party. However, I think Encore and WET Republic take the cake. Here are my gripes:\n\nSmall pool to splash around and sparse accommodations to any of your belongings, yet alone, leave it with a large pile of other people's belongings. Hence, bottle service gives you a small space to party like a rockstar with your friends and soon-to-be friends and leave your stuff hanging around. The service is baffling!! My friend orders us bottle service and pitchers of more alcohol to go around with our group, but to our own dismay, the little monster shuffling her small frame and fake boobs in our faces was utterly rude! She wanted us to pay first before we got our drinks?! WOW!! My friend paid for everything, called his credit card company to cancel the transaction, voila!, we got our FREE booze in hand!! Boo-yah!\n\nThe crowd was so-so. I've seen better eye candy at Encore and WR. A group of guys tried their best to fondle me and my girlfriends thinking I wouldn't say one word. I NEVER take that kind of advantage from ANYBODY! Security was shamefully nonchalant about the incident and scurried off thinking it was no big deal. Really?! After much avoidance and drinking plenty of vodka shots and AMFs, I was dancing like nuts to the filtering sounds of house music!\n\nI really want to give this place more than what it should be credited for but I find it disappointing when I receive lack of service from anybody. I enjoyed the hours of incredible music, my awesome set of company, and what was little to be known, an okay venue. Is it worth it to come back again? Depends. If they held any of my favorite house DJs, I'll be back or someone holds their birthday/bachelorette party here."
0,"Happy hour review only. \nWent here for a drinks and a small meal before watching Love. We ordered multiple small and overpriced appetizers and good priced cocktails/beers.  This is a good place to grab something before the show so your not starving through it.\n\nHere is what we ordered:\nSalmon & yellowtail - small portions but fresh\nLobster eggroll - good but probably not worth $7 - 4 small pieces\nSlider - very tasty, a must try. Ended up ordering another\nFloating orchid cocktail (for the hunny) - citrusy just the way she likes it\n$4 Japanese beer - decent price\n\nThe Bad:\n- Getting reservations was easy and booked through the hotel.  After getting seated by our host we waited what felt like forever for our waitress to even come to our table.  The happy hour was not even that busy.  During our entire meal, she was not to be found and we were continually looking for her to appear.  I probably would not come here again if their bar/happy hour service is any reflection of their dining area service."

They have an outdoor patio and its 100 degrees - I'm not dressing up to eat your BBQ, especially when there are plenty of more reasonably priced places around town. Ok, the BBQ buffet was free, but they aren't bringing out their A game stuff for free. I made it past the \""host\"" stand where there was some grumpy bouncer (for happy hour?), but then as I reached the back, another security guard (making $9hr) escorts me back to the front without saying anything. Then big bouncer with no brains or customer service ability (do they ever?) says I can't wear athletic shorts. He claimed he was a manager, but no way in hell did that guy manage anything, more or less have a college degree. Suddenly, we are in an argument, he is pointing out a sandwich board sign with about 20 different rules for dressing up to enter happy Hour and all I wanted to do was punch the dude. I ended up calling him a fat piece of ....and left determined noit to visit this place anymore. Maybe after 9pm put a dress code in, but that poilicy is just plain dumb.

This menu showed up on my door and I thought what the hell...well that's what I said after dealing with poor customer service and a dish called \""Dragon and Phoenix\"".  This dish sounded good but had well over a whole onion and very little flavor.  The meat dumplings....mystery meat!  Definitely not potstickers.  The search continues, good luck on your visit to this place."
1,"Great place for BBQ in Anthem. When you get a chance try their creation called the Hog Dog, don't be scared it's not as spicy as the description may imply. The Ribs are better than average, the fried macaroni and cheese lacks flavor. As for everything else on the menu, it's great. I can say that because I have tasted the whole menu already."
1,"Open 24 hours with very limited seating, the Oyster Bar proves to be a great reason to make an effort out to Palace Station. We went on a Monday afternoon, no wait though after us there was a rush and people were lined up for about 30 min. This isn't going to be a fancy meal, but it will be a good one at a expensive but fair price. \nI tried the pan roast combo and the broth was rich and full of seafood. \nWe also had the gumbo which was very large but average in taste, again, with lots of seafood.\nThis place is great if you are drunk, hung over or just want a meal. \nWe also got a cup of the regular clam chowder... it made me want to get the Alaskan one just so I could get more of everything. Though it looked like it could stop my heart if I ate it, this would be the way I would always want my clam chowder."

1,I was in the Phoenix area for a week for work and stopped by in Tempe to meet a friend. She recommended Genghis Grill and we went there. The ambience was good and the waiter was friendly.

0,"I went to Serendipity 3 to have a frozen hot chocolate.  I'd had one about 10 years ago in New York.  Honestly, I don't remember a thing about how it tasted but I figured it must have been good if there is now one in Vegas!\n\nThe place was crazy busy when we arrived but luckily I spotted a 'takeout' window on the side.  No biggie since I only wanted the frozen hot chocolate anyway.  Looking at the menu while waiting in line, I was shocked at the price for the frozen hot chocolate.  Most flavors were $11.  Flavors like 'peanut butter, mint or vanilla'.  No hint of fancy chocolate like Lindt or Ghirardelli flakes that might make the price worth it.  I bought anyway, the mochachino flavor, I wanted peanut butter but they were out and $12.97 later, ($1 for a plastic glass of tap water) I stood by the window and waited for my frozen hot chocolate.  They are fast, I will give them that, but what passed from the window into my hand was basically a grande frappucino at three times the price.  I'm not sure what others were raving about because nothing in that glass could come close to being worth the $11 price tag for the drink.  \n\nAs my friend and I wondered exactly why there are so many people at Serendipity we could only guess that 1 -they'd never been there before or 2- like me they couldn't remember having it the first time.  Apparently, if you actually sit down in the restaurant, the frozen hot chocolate is much larger which might have made me feel a tiny bit better.  However, either way, the melted milkshake with a load of whipped cream that is the frozen hot chocolate is not worth your time or money.  Go somewhere else.  There are plenty of gelato places in Vegas where you can get your ice cream fix if that is what you desire for 1/3 of the price."

Its a really excellent place to get some dinner or dessert with your friends before a night out or just to spend some time catching up. \n\nFriday and Saturday nights can have a little bit of a wait, so be prepared for that. The desserts are way better than some of the reviewers here give them credit for and they have a really excellent wide variety to choose from. \n\nPrivate lot in the back as well as street park all require coins for the meter (pain!) but, when i'm back in pittsburgh about once a year, a stop to gullifty's is always on my to-do list!"

When we compared to the other guests in our group who did not upgrade, we realized we were completely ripped off.  However, being in the Towers did keep us away from the XS 4am music so many other yelpers complained about.\n-We were also told there was a special pool included in our upgrade.  What they meant to say was that THE WYNN has a special pool for their tower guests, we had to schelp ourselves to the main pool.\n-Crusty room service cart was left in our room for 3 days!!!  \n-Encore Casino bars do not comp drinks.  I was told (even at the high roller bar) that I needed to move 3 feet to a slot machine, order my drink from a cocktail waitress (after flagging them down) and then return to the bar if I wanted to play the bar machines.  Or pay full price, which I what I ended up doing 90% of the time.  This is retarded.  When I complained, I was told \""No one cares what you think\"" by a sexy Patrick Swayze looking bartender.  We proceeded to have a whole conversation about how none of the Encore employees give a hoot how much I'm paying to be on vacation AT THEIR HOTEL.  He explained that they were enduring large series of layoffs and the entire staff was disgruntled.\n-I had the EXACT same \""No one cares about you or your damn vacation\"" with another pretty boy bartender at the boobie pool bar.  While these 2 guys were nice enough to me during these awful convos, they were perfectly clear about the fact that I am better off staying elsewhere in Vegas.  WTF???!!!  They were completely dogging their own hotel.\n-We had a cabana 2 days in a row, and only received decent service for 1/2 a day.  The poor girl also sang the same song, telling us that they were severely short staffed and she was doing her best.  Our other servers were so non-existent, our group took turns walking across the pool area to the bar.  What fun is a cabana without a cabana boy (or girl)???\n\nThe only good memory I have of the Encore were my room service fries.  Those were amazing.  The decor was pretty, but nothing could make up for the (lack of ) service when we're forking over major dough.  Sinatra's had good pasta and there's a great bartender in the red bar from NY.  Seriously, that's all I got.  \n\nGo elsewhere."
0,"I should have checked on here before visiting this place. If I could give them no stars I would too.\n\nI am sorry to say that this was by far the worst experience I have had dealing with anyone. I have dealt with some horrible used car salesmen before and this appliance place puts them all to shame. They have no common sense what so ever. They delivered a defective refrigerator and had the audacity to want to charge us 25% restocking fee when we requested to exchange it. I am appalled at their business practices and can not fathom how could someone let $35k worth of a sales fall through because they do not want to work with the customer and resolve some issues that in my opinion could have easily been rectified. Thanks to them we ended up going to Spencers and saved an additional $1200 because they were running a special when you buy a refrigerator, stove-top, and oven."
1,"I'm going to be honest. I've avoided this place since they opened in July because I was afraid of sticker shock. My fiance gets his haircut next door every month and I'm usually with him. Last weekend was the Pinup Pop Up event and I was getting antsy waiting around so I reluctantly went in to Kitten Retro Glamour expecting to be let down when I looked at the price tags. I TOTALLY wasn't! For vintage inspired QUALITY clothing, this place has some of the best prices I've seen! I found a brown faux fur stole that the owner generously placed on hold for me for a week so I could come back to try it on with my wedding dress and it was perfect! I plan on coming back after the holidays to try on a few other items! Kitten Retro Glamour won't let you down!"
0,This is the absolute worst motel I have ever seen.  Was put up there by delta airlines as they had to cancel our flight.  I walked in the room to find a huge cockroach on the floor.  The room just smelled.  I didn't sleep all night.  Filthy!
1,"I had a horrible experience three weeks ago in this restaurant. When I called the manager, she apologized and insisted that the waitress in question would receive more training. Upon our return last weekend (Hey, I can't help it...I love the food), the manager came by to make sure everything was okay at least 4 times during the meal. It was completely unexpected, but she gave us a discount on our meal, and offered us free dessert. I was simply happy with the apology, but Maria went out of her way to make sure that we had a good dining experience that night. (For the record, we had our usual fantastic service from our waiter). Great people. Will definitely return."
0,"Could all these reviews be the same place we tried recently?  Yep, i just checked my boarding pass.  We arrived just as they were opening in the morning.  It got so ridiculous  that I started taking notes on the back of my boarding pass.\nShould've walked away when the apathetic and surly girl behind the counter called the guy in front of us up and when he placed his order, told him they weren't ready to take orders yet! And it went downhill from there.  We ordered at 0459 and got our breakfast sandwich at 0512.  We were the second customers in line, and watched as five customers following us got their food first.  The place was chaos, there was no tracking of orders customers were just given food, presumably what they ordered, but not according to any system, the girl at the counter kept her back to the customers and stared into the kitchen, she was surly and rude and should most definitely be fired from customer service.  Customers just looked at one another and shook their heads.  We warned one guy off, he thanked us and left.  I have never seen anything like it.  I was truly worried about food poisoning, if the kitchen was so poorly managed what would the cleanliness be like?  \n\nWhoever owns this place:  You need to get some training, management and oversight going on!  ASAP.  Your place was a total embarrassment on 11 March 2013."
1,"It is like any other good boba place.  The atmosphere/ environment is nice and calm.  I had the boba milk tea and expected the taste.  The boba was good as well as the milk tea.  Its good, definitely a nice place to hang out.  It is also in the shopping center so it has a nice location.  Monkey man! haha\n\nUnfortunately, some of the seats were kind of dirty as well as the table but I am sure they were going to clean them soon.  \n\nI gave it four stars instead of 5 because the workers seemed a bit rude and the chair was dirty.  Doesn't truly stand out as the best but its a tea place alright."
1,Always love Gamestop and this one always has had some friendly and helpful staff.  Good selection of New and used games.
1,"Hussong's is located between Luxor and Mandalay Bay.  It seems to be the place that invented the margarita.  Whether that is true or not, is irrelevant, because the margarita's/drinks kicked @$$!\n\nThe drinks are not too expensive ($10-$12 range), but they still pack a nice punch.  Most drinks in Vegas are extremely watered down and 90% sugar, but not these.  They tasted fresh and did not resemble Kool-Aid.\n\nFor food, we enjoyed the quesadilla, which had tons of flavor, but was also very heavy.  \n\nCons:\nThe service was not good at all.  The servers were extremely friendly, but also extremely absent.  Maybe I caught them on a bad night.\n\nI will definitely look to come back here next time I am in Vegas, though."
0,"If this place was in chicago it would lose business to red lobster!  The food is ok but the quality of service could be better at a 4yr olds tea party.  If you like this place then you prob also like long johnsilver, and ass in the box.   Bread was cold, vegetables are better from seamer bag, and ask for extra salad with your dressing. Good luck"
0,"I'm sure being a get go employee is not what one aspires to be in their youth, but it CAN'T be that bad. Since I frequent this location often, ( twice a day on average) I'm aware of the late night rush for fast sandwiches and snacks. And since I work night shifts, I see what a disaster it can be. But the employees....Where do I even start? I've always written off their rudeness and complete lack of common courtesy as just them hating their jobs, but recently I've been so utterly appalled by their behavior I just have to say something because its just not right.  Two weeks ago my car key snapped off in my trunk. I had my spare, but the remote entry battery was dead. Of course, my cel phone was locked in my car. I went inside to try to call AAA. \"" Do you have a phone a could use?\"" I asked the man. Silence. \"" excuse me could I use your phone? I asked 3 times before I was even acknowledged and after about 4 minutes of back and fourth between employees it was decided I was allowed to use it. The cashier tossed the receiver I guess in my direction and, without ever even looking at me \"" what's the number\"" ? The receiver to my ear, I could hear he was just pounding away, typing in random numbers. He did this about four more times and then claimed it wasn't working because I didn't know the number. I handed him the triple A card so he could read it off that, but he just looked at it, said \"" that's what I just called \"" and that was it. Ok. Thanks for the help. A stranger let me use his cel phone and took 45 seconds.  Two days later, again exhausted after the night shift, I waited to be checked out by any one of the 4 employees hangin out at the deli area. After minutes of debating over which cashier was going to ring me up, a tall girl w long, straight hair came meandering over with a coffee cup suctioned to her chin. It stayed there the whole time. You know, like what a child does? A few times she adjusted it, making disgusting noises and the whole time touching her mouth, face and hair. She rolled her eyes and pounded away on the screen with her nails that had yellow plastic bows on them when I asked her to scan my advantage card. Oh I'm sorry, perhaps it would be easier to ask for it if you didn't have a cup stuck to your face. She also never once said a word to or even looked at me. Until I said have a good weekend to which she replied under her breathe \"" ummmmhmmmm ok\"". Nice. But the most disgusting display came the next night. A deaf couple was ordering sandwiches, and the red haired cashier, a short, heavy set deli woman, and the tall man who I inconvenienced by asking him to type 7 numbers into the phone, were making fun of them. \"" how am I gonna wait on them when they can't hear nuthin?\"" Waving her hands in an attempt to imitate sign language and speaking \"" like a deaf person\"". Laughing and poking fun while I waited for a cashier and they patiently waited to order. The deaf couple smiled the whole time, completely aware of what was going on, and trying to be the bigger people. I give them credit because I would have snapped. The short woman pointed to the cashier and literally screamed at the \"" YOU'All NEED TO PAY OVER THERE\"" her voice booming through the store. The red haired cashier,as she was ringing me up, heard it and burst into laughter. When the couple turned around, the woman rolled her eyes and her boyfriend put his arm around her and mouthed \"" it's ok, don't worry about it\"" in his \"" deaf guy voice\"" ( NOT my words). I'm aware that this location is about convenience , but there has to be better people out there. Management needs to really step in at this point because its simply out of control. I can handle people being rude to me on a daily basis, but I hate to see others, who can't even hear what they're saying, be treated like that! It was awful and every trip there becomes more uncomfortable. Come on, get go. Step it up. New employees, a new training program, something! This is not right!"
1,"Simply put, if you like chicken fried steak and you haven't been here you don't really like chicken fried steak.  I've eaten chicken fried steak pretty much everywhere in the world that its available and it just doesn't get much better than this.  Go with the fried potatoes instead of the mashed.  Not that the mashed are bad, just that the fried potatoes are so GOOD.  For those that are less enthusiastic about chicken fried steak, the fried chicken breast is also great as are the steaks and burgers.  Love the house salad with light oil dressing and diced olives on top.  Oh, and the biscuits, top notch, TOP NOTCH.  Don't let them get away with bringing you a bread basket that's half filled with biscuits and half filled with some wheat roll disaster, ask for all biscuits.  You're welcome."
1,Their Italian turkey sub is great. Service fast and friendly.
1,"Apres plusieurs recommandations, nous avons finalement d\u00e9cid\u00e9 d'essayer le Faberge. La deco est correct, la disposition du resto aussi. Excellent service attentionn\u00e9 et rapide ( matin de semaine ) ma ch\u00e9rie a essay\u00e9 les oeufs b\u00e9n\u00e9dictine ( cuisson parfaite et tres bon gout, la hollandaise etait excellente ) et moi la fameuse poutine matin ( grosse portion de patate maison, excellente hollandaise, oignon, fromage et l'oeuf poche a la perfection ).\n\nNous y retournerons c'est certain."
0,"Everything about this place SUCKS.\n\nI bought my Dad a meatball sandwich here and when we brought it back to the table, both the sauce and the meatballs were still cold.\n\nThe two Asian guys working behind the counter were also extremely rude and acted like they were thugs or something. I think they need to realize they're working at the Riviera Food Court, not living in 8-Mile."
1,"Excellent food, service and decent prices for what you get. I have been here twice and have not been disappointed. \nOn my last visit, I had just gotten out of the hospital and needed to eat and was desperately craving...\""REAL GOOD HEARTY FOOD\""!!! I hit the nail in the head with this place!! I had the special of the day which was Mahi-Mahi in a Thai chile lime sauce, served with fire roasted grilled veggies and a fluffy wild rice pilaf with a nice glass of Chardonnay. The fish was fresh & the veggies were not soggy. My meal ended with a slice of their decadent cheesecake and a rich n bold cup of coffee!! Not bad for under $45dllrs for all including tip!!"
1,"During the night shifts, get your drinks from Wil, he always has a smile on his face and makes an awesome cocktail."
1,"I love this seafood buffet. Many casinos claim to be a seafood buffet but this one really delivers. (There's only one other one that is pretty good and is off the Strip- Sam's Town.) When this buffet first opened, the lines were ridiculous.  If you weren't waiting in line by 4 pm, you'd be waiting for a very long time- seriously. I hadn't been in a while, until within the last few years with my husband- it's going to be an anniversary tradition.\n\nThe selection is amazing- broken into region types- Mediterranean, Pacific Rim, South America, North America. Langostino lobster (delicious), snow crab legs (a little salty at times but very good), dungeness crab (mmmm), oysters, peel and eat shrimp (with lemon and cocktail sauce- just like at the resident buffet, very good), crawfish (not a fan), sushi (I'll pass- sushi has to be eaten at a real sushi place), and soups (like chowder), just to name a few. The quality of many of the dishes is very good. \n\nThe dessert station is not as big or impressive as the other resident buffet, but by that time, one has eaten enough, right? Ha-ha, just kidding. I usually save room for dessert. And given the choice, it's almost always ice cream or gelato, in this case. \n\nThe last time we ate here, there was a wedding party of about 20 people. Seating is mostly chairs and tables, with some booth seating. The ambiance is much nicer at this buffet compared to the regular resident buffet, with artwork is cheeky- fish, but it's cute. The paint colors are warm neutrals, browns. It's not so crowded anymore, maybe could be due to the price. The service is pretty good- drinks refilled and the dirty plates are taken away. The food stations are clean and maintained/refilled. \n\nYes, it can be pricey, but I think that this seafood buffet is actually worth it and not many seafood buffets in casinos are true seafood buffets, either. It seems like these casinos have shrimp and slap on a name, Seafood Buffet, but it's simply false advertising, in my opinion. I've heard that the M Resort's buffet is very good, but we have yet to try it. For now, enjoy coming here though."
0,It's super expensive and the coffee isn't consistent. I don't recommend going there but the vibe of the place is nice! There just extending to big to fast!
0,I was not impressed with the sauce. And the beef seemed real greasy. Im use to sliced beef instead of shredded. Corn bread fell apart into a million crumbs when I took it out of the wrapper. I just wasnt impressed at all. The people were friendly and was a clean facility.
0,"I am a pastry student and when i saw the words \""gormet bakery\"" i thought hey this place could make their stuff... no i find out that the only thing they make IN HOUSE is their tiramisu everything else is made offsite... in France... so i thought ok lets get some kind of hot chocolate... they gave me dark chocolate pudding in a cup and not even good dark chocolate... i could only take a little bit before the taste was just terrible."
1,On the Strip so its expensive but the Fluffer Nutter shake was very good. Great option if you want a good dessert.
0,"I used to be a fan of the deli, but not anymore. While the food is good, the service is just idiotic and completely disrespectful. You'll wait at the counter for 15 minutes while 3 employees ignore you and are too busy catching up on their tasks, forgetting that a customer is not a disturbance, but the reason for their job. \nA bad experience could turn into a positive one with one and only small gesture: Let me know it will take a while or take 1 minute to take my order, so that I know you're not just wasting my time. What makes other's order so much more important than mine that you cannot even talk to me???\n\nThis is not the first time that this happened... it just gets worse each time... enough to scratch it off my list of good places. I'll just go down the street a few blocks to Roma Deli instead."
1,"I have been here 4 times and never had a major issue. \nLunch is only $5.99. If at $5.99 you expect high end, then go somewhere else. \nHave realistic expectations and you'll like it just fine."
0,I used to love this place because they had a huge variety like the Cheesecake Factory (aka something for everyone). But when I went in April they completely cut down the menu and all the good dishes are gone. I was really disappointed and expected more.
0,"Extremely disappointed in this restaurant.  Took my family  there to have a good meal, me and my daughter wanted ribs, but we were told they weer running out. I told her to get them and I ordered the catfish. The fish was so over cooked that it sounded like I was biting into potatoe chips. She said her ribs were OK, but I didn't try them since there were only 3 on her plate. My wife ordered the smothered steak, I gotta say the gravy was great, I loved it, but the steak was over cooked and instead of cooking it in the gravy they pied ur over the top. My fries cane out so burnt that I thought they gave me sweet potatoe ferries instead. I told her I wanted regular fries and she told me they weren't sweet potatoes and she would have then make me fresh ones. Who the hell would bring out fries that represent your establishment like that? \n     The waitress was nice and friendly and very helpful, she was actually the best part of the experience. It also disappointed me that our sides came out to us about 10 minutes before or meals did, and that I paid $18.50 for 3 pieces of fish and some small sides. It is way overpriced. I paid $8.50 for my son's sandwich that should of been a $2.99 item off of the kids menu. I wish I could say I'd go back but I'd be lying."
0,"After seeing this place on Diners, Drive Ins and Dives, I decided to give it a try.  Guy F. was raving about the place.   Ask any BBQ pro about boiling ribs and they will look at you like you just stole their elderly mother's life savings.  John Mull's boils their ribs before finishing on the grill but Guy stated \""this is competition meat\"".\n\nSo I make the trip there, really strange looking neighborhood and place.  Tiny on the inside, luckily it was not crowded.  I ordered a 2 meat combo.  Ribs and links, I told the young man preparing my plate that I wanted my sauce on the side, he said they don't put sauce on the meat, sauce is over on the counter.  Good sign.   I looked around as he was preparing my plate then went over to put some sauce in the little containers.   All set, got my food and headed out the door.  Not really any place to eat there except for some picnic benches outside but it was far too hot to be outside so I decided to head to the nearest covered lot and eat in my car.    Finally got to a hotel parking structure and was ready to feast!\n\nOpened my tray and found that this idiot kid covered my ribs with the links that were swimming in sauce!!!!  I literally wanted to scream!  I told the idiot I didn't want sauce on my ribs yet he proceeded to put the cut links and sauce on top of my ribs.\n\nAnyway, started on the ribs and they were not very good at all, tender but no flavor at  and the sauce sucked!   The links tasted like hot dogs.   Overall not good Q.\n\nThanks Guy!!!   I was at another restaurant and the owner claimed that Triple D requests a fee for them to visit your restaurant.   I believe that.  Have you ever seen Guy say \""that place was just OK'??"
0,"I'm a snob when it comes to restaurant service.  I expect good service and tip accordingly.  The service did not disappoint.  The food, however, needs some major revamping.  I had a half a rack of their supposedly award winning baby back ribs.  The meat was dry and had absolutely no flavor.  The two sides I ordered were the fried okra and the mac and cheese.  The mac and cheese looked and tasted like it came out of a Kraft Mac and Cheese box.  Also had the three item sampler:  onion straws, fried pickles, and burnt ends.  I kid you not, there was literally a puddle of oil under the wax paper in the basket that held the appetizers.  TGIF's baby back ribs are much more flavorful and their meat is much more savory.  Will definitely not be returning to this place.  Plus one star for the service experienced."
0,"We waited about 50 minutes for our food of a sweet beef bowl and 2 veg rolls.\n\nToo pricey for the portions.\n\nOur waitress was either on the verge of a nervous breakdown or on a lot of speed. Not really part of the review, just.. man if I could put a warm blanket around her and tell her everything will be okay, I would have."
0,"My first review was filtered and will continue to post my review until it is not!! This place is HORRIBLE. Here is my original review!\nWent to the one in Ceasars forum shops, great service when your in the store but it ends the second you walk out the door. Bought a pair of Frankie B jeans and when i was packing to leave Vegas the next day found the security tag was still on them (which shocked me as i walked out the store and in 3 other stores without any alarms going off) tried to call the store and left multiple messages since no one seems to answer the phone EVER there. Didnt get a call back until 2 days later after i was already back in Chicago. I didnt even get an apology, was just oh well find someone to take it off, found a store here that would take it off and discovered the nasty hole left in the jeans... mind you these are 165 dollar jeans that now have a hole in them. Will never shop there again!"
1,"We ate here around 2am after a late night out at the clubs - while in Vegas for a business conference  - and it was outstanding.  I had the Mongolian Beef and my two colleagues had other relatively common Chinese dishes, and all were excellent.  Still can't believe there was that high a quality of Chinese available in the middle of the night, right next to the sport book at the Venetian where I was staying, but hey ... it is Vegas.  Would definitely go again."
1,"THE BEST YOGA STUDIO IN PHOENIX, HANDS DOWN!\n\nWhy?\n1. Quality Teachers\n2. Dedication to authentic yoga\n3. Supportive community environment\n4. Variety of styles\n5. Yoga teacher training/advanced studies program\n\nI've been doing yoga for more than 15 years, and have tried many studios in the valley. Yoga Pura, by far, is the best studio in town for an authentic experience of yoga.\n\nI particularly enjoy Eric's classes on Tuesdays and Thursdays. There is a certain focus and concentration, as well as a the overall feeling of peace I experience during his classes that I just can't get anywhere else. He teaches yoga as a discipline for creating peace and happiness in his students' lives...not just fluffy stretching.\n\nSome of my other favorite classes include Nyla's Level 1 & 2 and essentials,  Rachel's essentials class, and for a good restoration class, check out Laura. I also absolutely LOVE the Yoga Nidra (guided meditation) offered here. Nidra is really hard to find in town, and YP is one of the few places that actually trains teachers in the practice of Nidra. \n\nRegardless of what your looking for...hatha, flow, power, gentle, restorative, meditation...whether you are new or an experienced practitioner, you will find something here that suits your practice style. My best advice to you is to try different teachers and different classes. \n\nOnce you start coming here, you may never stop! If you come regularly, you will undoubtedly make friends. It's so nice to come to class and see people I've met over the years. The community at YP is definitely one of the things that makes it so special.\n\nLastly, yet most importantly.... \n\nYoga is about realizing your limitless potential and releasing from the suffering of the mind. It does this by bringing you into alignment with your \""true self\"" and freeing your mind from the lies it tells itself. I always knew that yoga made me feel better. But it wasn't until I started practicing with Eric at Yoga Pura that i started to understand why. This lead me to take YP's Yoga Teacher Training and Advanced Studies program in 2011. It was by far THE BEST thing I have done to improve my life. And for that, I will be eternally grateful to Eric, YP teachers and the YP community.\n\nBut don't take my word for it...Test it out for yourself. They offer 3 free classes for newcomers. ENJOY!"
1,"I've been wanting to eat here for a couple years now. This past Wednesday I invited Angela to come with me.\n\nI called the night before and made a reservation for 1900. I asked for the omikase menu and was told they have a $75 and a $100 (per person) menu. People actually opt for the $75? Seriously, if you're going to go out and eat and do something like this, go all out.\n\nSo I chose the $100. It's a 10 course meal. I asked if that was enough food and she assured me it would be. \n\nWe came early, about 20 minutes early but they had a table for us. We got one of their private booths which I'm guessing we only got it because we came early. \n\nOh yeah, I possibly should have started this review with saying that this place might be the best Japanese restaurant I have ever, EVER been to.\n\nI honestly don't remember every single meal we got but it was all amazing. I'll list them and discuss what I thought was the best thing.\n\nWe were given grilled cherry tomatoes, four different types of sashimi, grilled kobe beef, grilled pork, homemade cold tofu, agedashi tofu in broth, green tea creme brule, cheese cake and a hot pot with kobe beef in a red bean broth. The last thing was our 11th course as we still wanted another dish after the 10 though honestly, I think we were good and full after the 10 but the food was so good we wanted to try one more dish.\n\nA lot of their food comes from organic farms. This is important because the best thing we had was our grilled pork. It's prepared, medium. Yep, not fully cooked. The waitress told us the pigs are only fed acorns. It. Was. God-like. I couldn't believe pork could taste so good especially cooked medium. Way better than even the kobe beef. The homemade tofu, crazy good. Crazy good. The condiments on the table are even amazing. They make their own soy sauce and it's the best soy sauce I've ever had. They have some kind of wasabi salt. I've never even heard of such a thing. Outstanding. Our last dish, the hot pot, they gave us two raw eggs. I'm thinking that we're going to crack these eggs into the broth. Totally wrong. We're told to crack the eggs into our bowls, scramble it, and then use it as dipping sauce for the food that comes out of the hot pot! Again, the eggs are organic. Taste was amazing. And made complete sense as the broth is really sweet, remember it's red bean based so the raw egg totally balances the taste. So awesome. Seriously, so awesome. And I mean all the food we had was so awesome. Actually, it's AWESOME. If I could, I'd eat here every week. Well, I promised myself that next time I come here I'll either omikase at the sushi bar or I'll do the kaiseki which you need to make a reservation 3 days in advance for! Did I mention the word awesome?"
1,"I have been looking for a new shop since i came to Phoenix about 2 years ago. I was on my way to a different tattoo shop and decided to stop at Inkenstein just to check it out on the way. I showed up at the right time as Jason was finishing with a customer so i had no wait time. I threw out my ideas, he gave his, tweaked them a little bit and i ended up with a perfect tattoo. Exactly what i pictured. My wife will be coming here soon for her next tattoo and i will be back for sure."
0,"Steve and Claudia are very rude.  Michael Reiss is a nice guy, but has hired the two rudest, most incompetent, morons imaginable.  These people scammed me out of $350 after stealing it out of my deposit.  We rented from these people for 1.5 years.  We had a 3BR house and we are single family.  Before we left we spent a couple hundred to get it spotless and our lawn guy came (as he did every month) to get the lawn in order.  They still charged us $150 for the lawn service and $100 for cleaning service.  What they do is, they wait until the end of the month to take pictures of the lawn and the house.  Of course after a month of no one living in it the weeds are going to grow back and the house is going to get dusty.  Then they take pictures of everything and charge you double.  This is the most unethical and conniving company I have ever dealt with.  If you have a chance to talk to Claudia or Steve, just punch yourself in the face, you'll have a better time with it."
0,"I am very disappointed to say the least! I ordered on GrubHub for delivery. \n\nI ordered fried zucchini sticks which were pretty good! Except finding an order of mozzarella sticks tossed in with them which was not a good thing considering they were less than satisfactory. \nThe pizza slice I ordered, is probably one of the worst slices I've had in a while! I'm glad I just didn't order a full pizza. \n\nSo the slice of pizza was part of a meal special: slice, wings, and soda. \nNo soda came and the wings were rock hard.\n\n\nSuch a waste of money. I will not be returning."

I called him at 10:05, and again at 11:30 both times it was sent over to voicemail, and the guy didn't even have the decency to call me back to cancel or explain why he stood me up. Now I have to find someone else, and I have to pay a fine from my HOA! Don't trust this guy!!!!!!! Find someone else, unless you like to sit around waiting for a promised appointment that does not get fulfilled!"
1,"Holy crap.\n\nOnce you get past the line, the other line, then the last line, you walk into a day clubber's paradise.\n\nLoud, banging bass (We saw Dada Life! They were amazing!) Beautiful people everywhere (ugly ones too, but I didn't focus on them).\n\nI went with eight buddies for my bachelor party, and we had the time of our lives at Wet Republic. We didn't spend $1,500 on a cabana or bottle service and got in just fine with our pre-sale tickets. Then we enjoyed the $10 beers and danced the afternoon away!"
1,"The crepes are Japanese style, so there's a abundant of flavors from the classical strawberry-banana-Nutella to hamburgers wrapped in a crepe! The price is very decent for the portion size.\n\nI got a pure dessert crepe, totally forgot the name but it was strawberry and a slice of cheesecake with blueberry drizzle. There was literally a piece of cheesecake in the crepe. For once, the window pictures don't lie.\n\nUnfortunately you don't get a spoon for the crepes, but take your time to eat the giant crepe; it is very doable!"
0,"The place has history and is family owned.. both great but does the food have to taste like its been there since the place opened 60 years ago? The salsa's were all pretty lame.. 3 in total which they charge you if you want refills. There are 2 reds and one green.. one of the reds is little more then tomato sauce with some oregano in it. The 2nd red is a chunky salsa where all you can taste is garlic. The green is their 'spicy' salsa but its slimy consistency failed to burn or taste good. \n\nThe cheese crisp me and my mother shared was pretty darn good! I wish though we would have cut our losses there. The problem is the little weird things they do to their food and sauces. The beans have this strange after taste that I could not decipher.. the red sauce had a similar weird after taste, like I dunno, old. The tamale was covered in the red sauce but the weird old taste covered up what was probably a decent enough tamale. Do they put ground clove in their masa? Like I said, its those weird little touches that didn't appeal to me about this place. \n\nService was friendly and the place quaint.. however with the weird touches and so so salsa I probably wont go back. Very, very disappointing coming from a real food landmark!"
0,"While the quality of the food is good, the priority of the kitchen really makes you wonder at how they even function at times. While our visit was on a week night and when it really wasn't all that busy, they still somehow managed to complete three orders that were no more complicated than ours... for people that ordered AFTER US. \n\nI had a half sandwich with salad and her with a bowl of soup. How complicated is that, seriously? The person taking the orders needs to focus on just that and not try to help the bus staff. \n\nThis was disappointing to say the least and perhaps was an isolated incident. Then again, most likely not.\n\n*Update*\n\nI have received a very nicely worded and very sincere email from one of the founders relating to our visit. We have spoken about this visit in question and I am satisfied with the end result. As such, I have amended my review from two stars to three.\n\n*Update to update*\n\nAs of today, 22 DEC 14, I have yet to receive any further contact as it related to my initial review despite replying both via Yelp and a direct email as requested. As such, my review goes back down to two stars. Pretty disappointed given how promising the initial contact seemed to be. We definitely will not be going back now"
1,I was only visiting the area and wanted to kill some time so I found a movie that was playing.  I must say I was impressed by what I saw!  I love the fact that they offer child care at the movie.  There have been many occaisions in which I would have loved to catch a movie but it wasn't appropriate for the kids to watch and childcare was an issue.  This is also great if you are on vacation and you and the hubby want to catch a flick childfree.  The other thing that I loved was the fact that they have the popcorn seasonings avaiable for you to use.  At our local movie theatre you have to pay $1.50 for a tiny shakable container.
1,"My dog, Blitz, hates being groomed. The last place I took her to had her completely traumatized... when I walked her into Shaggy Chic she immediately started shaking (she's a 50lb Vizsla). The groomer immediately made both Blitz and I totally comfortable- when i came back to pick her up, she was comfortably sitting down- and seemed completely fine. I am so excited to have found a groomer who knows how to treat my dog- I will be back many more times for sure!"
1,"I had done Bikram Yoga for a year before I came to this studio. I had a 30 day unlimited yoga Groupon and since this studio was slightly closer to my house I figured I'd try it for a month. I haven't gone back to my old studio.\n\nThe room is huge with four rows which makes it super nice even on crowded days. The locker rooms are roomy with multiple showers compared to the one at my old studio. The instructors are wonderful. At times tough and at time inspiring, but always helpful and consistent with the class and dialogue (a complaint of mine at my last studio).\n\nBut the absolute best thing about this studio is the sense of community here. They have potlucks and fundraisers for charity and parties every now and then. It is really great to get to know instructors and fellow students outside the classroom.  It is tough some days to put yourself in a hot room and practice yoga, but you always feel welcomed and at home when you come here to practice."
0,"I've always found the Museum of Modern Art to be fairly badly used, in that they choose some rather poor exhibitions to stage there.\n\nLast time I went it was the Edward Munch exhibition, which largely consisted of entire rooms holding the same image (predominantly the Scream) in a variety of different colour prints and not many (if any at all) original and finished pieces of art.\n\nI was more interested in the Gallery's more permanent exhibits, such as the giant metallic creature in the cafeteria.\n\nExhibits tend to price in the range of \u00a37-10, which, depending on the exhibition can seem reasonable or not, especially considering the more substantial National and Portrait Galleries are free.\n\nIt's a shame because the venue is nice, set in some lovely surrounding grounds and just a little out of town. Just wish they would up the ante a little.\n\nUntil a decent exhibition comes along, I'd recommend the Portrait Gallery over this."
1,"I want to review the salon there, particularly Kristina.  When I walked in, I told her that she could do whatever she wanted to with my hair, and just gave her a few basic guidelines.  My cut turned out amazing!  I now have this punky choppy awesome cut, which I love and get compliments on all the time!  She is not the super chatty or gossipy type, which is fine with me - though I know some want that from their stylist.  Also, she is not as good with color as she is with cutting, but with suggestions from the other stylists my color turned out great as well."
0,"One of the worst most expensive Mexican restaurant I have ever been to. I live in Los Angeles and am used to good Mexican food and this was a disaster. I think I could find a taco truck that serves better Mexican food. The only good factor was the martini but at $17.00 it still left a lot to be desired. I ordered a chipotle chicken that was tiny, ice cold and at $28.00 a complete rip off. I had to send the meal back and was told it would only take a couple of minutes to get my Pollo Asado. Twenty minutes later I had not gotten it and my guest had already completed their meal. When the dish finally arrived it was a plain chicken breast, a side of beans, and a Chile pepper. It looked like something you would get at Baja Fresh.  Our bill was $85.00 for two entrees and two martinis. At these prices you would expect something unique. I have had better food at Chipotles and spent$ 10.00."
0,"If I could give a nostar rating for my very first experience here I would. I decided to try them out since everyone gave them a great review and they are doing the 4 garments & 1 comforter for free deal. Well upon my arrival I mentioned  the \""Yelp\"" deal and they said that only applied to the Tempe location?!! I wonder f you go to Tempe, they tell you it only applies to the Scottsdale location. Not impressed on first contact. I walked out."
0,"The food was gross and the service was rude and slow. It took us over an hour just to get out of there, and there were only 2 people in the entire restaurant. I don't want to waste time even going into detail over it cause I feel like enough time has already been wasted on this business."
0,"This place is like Jekyll and Hyde.  When I ate in, I thought the service was excellent and the foods were excellent.  The portion awesome.  When I went back again but wanted a carryout meat over rice dish- I got a lot of rice with with barely any meat.  And they sent me off with a one chopstick (my fault for not making sure I had a set).  I need two chopsticks to make chopsticks work.  But I guess there wasn't much food to eat and one chopstick would do, cause I tossed most of the generous rice away. I speared the two pieces of scallop sized meat  with my one chopstick.  After two bites, my 11 dollars meal was all gone (still had a lot of rice left though and of course one marinated egg - which was a regular sized boil egg).  Overall, unlikely to be going back for carryout, maybe to eat in.  But for sure I will not risk another take out overly generous white rice.  \n\nCarryout rating - 1 star\nEat In rating - 3 stars\nAverage - 2 stars"
0,"Not great.  Was hoping to like this place since they appear to have great happy hour deals and a good environment for catching games on TV, but our food came out cold and bland.  At least it's another chain that I can cross off of my \""chains I've never been to\"" list."
1,"Love the power yoga, such a stress reliever. The place is open and warm and inviting. Great instructors the place is super clean and not over crowded. I highly recommend Bliss"
0,"I was so disappointed with my Monsoon visit. While prices seemed fair I felt the food was lacking. I called in a to-go order that was ready quickly. No complaints there.\n\nWe sampled the fresh rolls. It must have been a bad day for their shrimp order because these did not live up to their namesake. They were huge and to my dismay actually tasted kinda rotten. The peanut sauce paled in comparison to the sauce served at Doan's.\n\nAlso sampled was the Tom Yum soup. It had large chunks of tough lemongrass and no subtle flavors or really any flavors.\n\nWe enjoyed the old stand by Kang Panang Curry: Panang curry in coconut cream with peas, carrots, bell peppers, chopped lime leaves and sweet basil.\n\nI wouldn't go back just for that though when other restaurants are the total package."
0,"I stayed here for two nights this past New Year's Eve. I wasn't expecting much but was glad to find a place on the strip that wasn't $400 a night. I think this hotel is geared more for families with the fun dungeon and tournament of kings, not to mention the exterior being a castle. The interior is very dated with old carpet and a lingering smell of cigarettes. The parking is pretty limited and the garage is kind of far from the actual hotel rooms. We got a room in Tower 2, facing the Luxor. Due to the Las Vegas heat and the direction of our window, our room feel like an oven but the air conditioning helped (although it was quite loud). The room was pretty dusty and the bathroom average, but the linens were clean and the TV had more channels than when I stayed at the Planet Hollywood. Excalibur charges a resort fee per day that includes wired internet and local/domestic calls. I don't think that I would personally stay here again, but it's a cheap hotel and you really get what you pay for."
1,"You would have a hard time finding this place and probably would not be impressed with the decor, Mr. Wong has been hemming my pants and jeans for years! He promises me that one day, years from now, his shop won't be there anymore. On that day, I suppose I will have to go somewhere else. Until then, I bring him my Juicy, my Lucky, my lined work pants, etc. and he gets them done quickly and precisely. If it's not broke, don't fix it and Wong's works! Prices are very reasonable, work is excellent."
0,"It seems like every other time I take my pets to Point Breeze there is an unnecessary frustration.   From being berating for using their online prescription program to being misquoted prices substantially to poor customer service I just keep hoping each time will be better.  Although I know they love animals I suspect they love money more.  Dr. Caroline. Simard is an excellent vet, but my last two visits have been pushed to other vets whose bedside manner is atrocious.   I'm a 40 year-old  who has been taking my pets to vets since childhood and I don't understand why each visit leaves a sour taste in my mouth."
1,"Even though I was there 8 years ago, i'm still giving this 5 stars.  During game days the bridge is closed off to vehicular traffic making this a pedestrian only bridge, adding to the gameday atmosphere leading you right to the gates of PNC Park.  Now if only the Bucs can put a winning product on the field...."

1,"Phantom - The Las Vegas Spectacular (Venetian Hotel & Casino)\n\nWhen planning to see this PLEASE book way in advance to get the best seats possible.  I recommend the first 15 rows center (best is first five A- E, can really see the actors' intensity while singing).  Drawback is the chandelier events will require you to turn around in your seat to see it.\n\nThis Las Vegas enhanced production of the popular Broadway musical will have fans of the original captivated. The show is about one hour forty minutes in its entirety unlike the original of two and a half hours. Meaning some portions of the play were removed (Webber's classical songs remain) and the intermission (sorry no bathroom breaks). The 1,800-seat theater was built from the ground up for this production solely to accommodate incredible special effects and elaborate new sets. \n\nThis is a spoiler to two events of the play, but I want you to understand what to decide in selecting seats.  The playhouse will look old and abandon.  Then the drapes will rise exposing the playhouse and disassembled chandeliers hanging in four pieces will reassemble in dramatic fashion (awesome watching the large swaying chandeliers move about). Later in the show the chandelier will fall some fifty feet in mere seconds and abruptly stops only several feet above those seated beneath it (those seated under it screamed).  So you have to decide if you want to enjoy a large portion of the show up close and have to turn around couple of times to see the events behind you (think the chandelier assembles/falls about row J or so (8-10 rows back from stage) or just watch the show uninhibited.  We were in row C seats 27 & 28 (third row, almost center).\n\nAlso recommend dinner at Delmonico Steakhouse - (Venetian Hotel & Casino, see my review).  First reservations at 5pm giving you plenty of time to catch the show at 7pm (6:30 seating)."
1,Beautiful as ever!
1,"Great service! They send the food out quick, price it moderately, and are very willing to help out with dietary restrictions. I am a vegetarian and don't eat much dairy...the server was quick to come up with something delicious to fit my needs. Not an upscale place by any means, but good food at the right price on the Strip! The boyfriend said the milkshakes are phenom too! :)"
1,Went in to ask about botox and Juviderm. Francesca was great and explained the different options and was not selling me anything that I didn't need. Loved the results and the price was great (special). Will definitely be going back and have told my friends.
0,"When I told everyone, excited out of my mind that I was going to see The Black Keys at Corn Exchange - the first thing that came out of their mouth was a massive groan and then they said it was a shitty venue.\n\nEveryone was completely right.\n\nThe Black Keys are unendingly talented and brilliant and perfect and life-changing...\nso they overcame this shitty venueness. Any other band in the universe - I would have killed myself. \n\nAdvice: Bring gum so you can put that shit in pushy bitches' hair. \n\nAmerica plug: 21+ is awesome because there is NEVER anyone 16 there. \nDrunk 16 year olds are literally the worst people in the whole f**king world."
0,"This is the worst experience I have ever had in the Auto service industry. I made an appointment for an oil change with a Groupon coupon I had purchased. My appointment was at 9am and I arrived on time. I asked how long it might be and was told an hour. I sat down in the waiting room with three other individuals who had arrived prior to me. The one gentleman was in for a tune up, one gal to have her breaks checked and another woman to get her brake pads replaced. Two hours and fifteen minutes later the four of us are still sitting there with no news or updates on our vehicles. The breaks checked gal decides she will need to come again another day and when she tells the clerk this he says, \""Are you sure? We are about to pull your car in now.\"" The break pads woman left after 3.5 hours. At 11:15 am the clerk comes to tell me that they did not have the correct oil filter for my car so they have ordered one but he doesn't feel comfortable letting me leave with the current one installed and asks if I can wait another 15 minutes. I reply by stating that I don't feel that I have a choice. At 12:54 he comes to tell me my car is ready. (What happened to 15 minutes?) He offers me six free oil change coupons for the inconvenience and states that \""it doesn't normally take this long.\"" Yet everyone else in the waiting room had been waiting nearly as long for their minor services as well. Four hours for an oil change? No offer to take me home, no communication as to what was taking so long, no honest apologies - just an offer to come back for free oil changes. Free or not, my time is worth more than that. I was not pleased when I left to get into my car to find my keys were dirty with a black residue and so was my steering wheel, emergency break and shifter. Yuck! I had to clean me and the inside of my car after my visit. I was sorely disappointed."
1,"This particular Panera is a staple in my life - which I honestly don't care to make a major corporate, chain-run restaurant my place to run to on rainy days, when I have a cold, or when I just need a bowl of soup or a healthy salad to start my day.  But it is.  It's been not only that but a place of longing that various co-workers have agreed that when we hear some Chet Baker or otherwise lounge-jazz music that we'd \""rather be at Panera.\""  It's reliable, the food is always good, and I always know what to expect.\n\nThat said - for those who aren't in the know of Panera, get out from under your rock and get in the 'know!  Panera is a light lunch/breakfast eatery that offers a bakery with morning bites, with jazz music floating throughout.  It's a hit with all ages, offering free wi-fi, and its very popular with everyone from children to seniors.  They have a you pick two deal which allows you to mix and match a variety of things from the whole soup/salad/sandwich/etc so you can get a pretty sweet combo for just six-ish bucks.  You typically have kids working there who remember your name, your preferences (One girl would give me a free cookie if I always wore one piece of Nintendo gear so I ended up with a lot of free cookies!)\n\nMy only complaint with this particular location is that the upholstery, carpetry, and the door handle and a few things here and there needs an upgrade.  They're worn and their age is showing as opposed to a few years ago when they looked brand spanking new.  A major warning that I have as far as just \""dropping into\"" this place is to make SURE that you are not coming on a soccer afternoon!  See that field across of Rainbow?  Chances are that a lot of the players are going to flood Panera as soon as their game lets out and not only is going to grind service to a halt, but you may be finding that a good chunk of the menu is now depleted.  The upside to this is that there are other very good restaurants in this place about twenty feet away: Viet Bistro, Market Grille Cafe, and Chipotle.  \n\nMy particular favorite dishes?  I adore the Chicken/Rice soup, Chicken Almond Salad Sandwich, and the Thai Chopped Chicken salad are among my favorites.  Keep in mind that the soups change from day to day and that certain non-creme based soups do not do well in their delicious sourdough bread bowls."
1,"Stopped in for dinner the night before our visit to the University of Pittsburgh with one of my kids.  We were quite hungry and ordered both appetizers and main course.  In summary, this was really very good Indian food, definitely exceeded our expectations for Pittsburgh.\n\nAppetizers were Samosas and chicken with Manchurian sauce.  The samosas were tasty, well cooked and served with a very nice plum  sauce.  The chicken dish was delicious!  Coated, fried chicken pieces topped with a fantastically hot and spicy sauce.  Highly recommended and we would order again.\n\nMain course was chicken tikka masala, mutter paneer and shrimp korma.  The best of the three was the mutter paneer, peas and paneer in a creamy sauce.  Next best, the chicken masala had a great sauce, but the chicken was a little overcooked and a tad tough.  Bringing up the rear was the shrimp dish, again sauce was good but the shrimp got lost in the dish. \n\nWe also ordered the bread basket, a mix of different types of Naan and Roti.  Greta deal, and the bread was delicious,\n\nWill we come back?  Without a doubt."
1,"YUMMY!!!  I have only had delicious and fresh food from DeFalco's....and I have been a customer for the last 5 years!!  Great food, friendly staff.  Just a heads up...because the food is so good...they can tend to have a long line and you may wait for your food for a while.  They even have a sign up that states if you have don't have 15 mins to spare to wait for your food...you may not to make other lunch arrangements.....and it is true. My advice..... If you're in a rush, call in, they will take phone orders."
0,Probably would have been good but the 10 minute wait in the drive thru with no cars ahead of me was ridiculous. I don't know what I was waiting for considering my burger was still moo-ing even though I ordered it well-done. Gross. Not going back.
1,"Blackened catfish grits, shrimp grits, crawpuppies - everything here is amazing, and Abita to boot! I've eaten my way through NOLA's best, oldest and most well-known eateries and Lola's has it down. She  refuses to buy shrimp from anywhere but the gulf, and orders bread from the big easy too, and the attention to detail shows. My growing gut hates Lola's, but my tastebuds love it!"
1,Long line but we moved fast. Excellent food that rivals good restaurant. Try the NY strip steak and fresh seafood. Desserts were excellent as well.
1,"Oh Jean Phillipe, if my countrymen could make pastries as well as you do, I too would be quick to surrender during wartime so I could get back to eating your delicious confections.  The first time I came here, I was paralyzed by all the choices - I wanted to try everything!  Unfortunately my tiny wallet could not keep up with my cavernous stomach so we opted for the Tiramisu, Raspberry Cheesecake, and Chocolate Creme Brulee.  My friend loved the Creme Brulee, I thought it was ok, with exception of the chocolate cracker within it which was divine.  You bite into something dark and rich and sweet and then all of a sudden you reach something that is thin, crunchy, and light.  It's amazing!  The raspberry cheesecake was good, except it might be cloyingly sweet for some, it was almost too much for me.  And finally the tiramisu, Jean Philippe takes this trite dessert to new heights.  It's creamy, light, velvety, sweet, and just bitter enough all in one bite.  If you don't get anything else here, get the tiramisu!\n\nJean Philippe Maury.\nNot only do you boast the largest chocolate fountain in the world at your Bellagio counterpart's patisserie, but you have the nerve to entice me with classic French pastries, cr\u00eapes, and gelato. Fils de pute!"
0,"Hello, I've been an old customer since they were located on Indian school. I've been going to tandooori times for past 6 to 7 years but never experienced such a bad customer service from restaurant owner. We were waiting by the bar and the table opened up so we move forward to be seated and another customer grabbed the table without asking anyone else. The ppl worked  there couldn't speak up so we ended up getting a table in the corner. At this point we were waiting there for 45 mins. On top of that another server grabs our food and serves another table. Waiter came and apologized and brought our food out 15 mins later. I ordered vegetarian dish and she comes out with non-veg dish. At this point I'm furious and asked for the food to be waived. Our server calls the owner and he said, \""I don't serve free food to my own parents\"". Denied to give us free food after the whole hoopla and time that was wasted. Me and my husband used to be huge fan and even though my food was served with hair in it once and i let that go BUT this made it all WORST! The owner doesn't know how to treat customer. Do not waste your time and money!!!"
1,"SO much fun! I went here last weekend and had a total blast. The staff and crowd are beyond friendly. If you're looking for cheap well made drinks, and a great environment check it out! There is a cover, which doubled as a drink voucher so no big deal. The Drag show on Friday's rocks!! Worth stopping by."
0,WORST SERVICE EVERY. \nWe never got a refill of our waters. \nSmall portion size for the price.\nthey put on an 18% service charge (TIP) when Service was bad. \nI would never go back!
1,"I have always had a great experience every time I have seen a show. Amphitheaters are not normally my thing but this place does its job. I always prefer indoor concerts 9 time out of 10 but sometimes I can't help it if a band is coming that I want to see. This place has always been clean and spacious. I like the convenient location and parking.  I have seen 311, Something Corporate, Death Cab for Cutie and Jenny Lewis and the Watson Twins here and have all been great experiences."
1,Such a great place. Great service and everyone was super nice. LOVE! The food was delicious!!
1,"After driving by Sam's tons of times, I thought it was just another Pittsburgh Sandwich shop.  Eventually I decided to give it a try and to my surprise Sam's offers great Mediterranean food at great prices.  Every time I'm there I get the falafel and baklava and my girlfriend gets the chicken gyro.  \n\nThe people that work here are extremely friendly and more than willing to strike up a conversation with you. If you're in the area I highly recommend Sam's especially if you enjoy Mediterranean food.  Who would have thought that the best falafel in town is from this little unsuspecting place on Brownsville Road?"
1,"I stopped into the Bellagio today to pass some time before going to an appointment.  While there, i stopped at JP Patisserie and had some banana gelato.  \n\nThey have added tables along the hallway, and I was able to get a seat with a view toward the pool area.  The gelato was great, as always, and I enjoyed it more with a seat good for people watching.\n\nJean Philippe, whether at the Bellagio or Aria, is a great stop to make."

0,"I have been a customer here for the past three winters and have always had a good experience. I typically have a pedicure and acrylic nails and I always go to the same person. Although the personnel there has not changed, this winter, I have had to wait 30 minutes plus after my appointment time before anyone started working on me. Last week, was the third time this happened. When I arrived, I was told it would be a few minutes. After 30 minutes, I was told to sit at my person's table. It was only then that I realized he was only about half-way through working on someone's pedicure. After another 5 minutes of waiting, I left and will not be returning. There is no point in making appointments if there is no intention to keep them. He obviously started the pedicure moments before my appointment when he should have set that time aside for my appointment. Very disappointed."
0,Great rooms but that's all. First we have been moved to another room the second night ruining our morning. Barbara at the front desk was rude and unhelpful and made us get crazy to solve a problem they caused! They also messed with our players card and we never saw coffee and newspapers included in the suite price! A beautiful setting ruined by the attitude of the employees.. Will never book it again!
0,"Well,  I was  ready for a superior burger at BurGR. I'm a huge Gordon Ramsey fan and was sure I would be writing a great review. Not so!  Old Gordon dropped his standards.  The burger was not flavorful and the truffle fries were undercooked and greasy. \n\nProbably better than the one rating,  but this is a Gordon Ramsey restaurant so the expectations were high. Go to BLT instead. \n\nGordon - I know you're making a lot of money and building a brand,  but you need to keep the standards high.  If you don't change things,  you may find BurGR on kitchen nightmares."
0,"Service was not so good tonight. We had to ask for utensils after they served our food. I ordered pho with tendon and got one lousy piece. When I asked for a few more pieces, it finally came but was not cooked all the way and was cold in the middle. We had to ask for things at least 4 times that should have been provided in the first place."
0,"I hate giving a low score review to a mom and pop place, but I write critical reviews in the hope that places like this improve their operations. This was my third visit over the years to Bunky's. I thought the food was unique and adequate so we planned to go there for our annual Christmas family outing especially since our daughter from Kansas City is vegetarian. \n\nWe arrived on time and were barely acknowledged. We were finally seated after a 5 minute wait. Our server was asked what she recommended and she told us that she had started 6 days ago and had never eaten there. The server needed training. She didn't appear when we needed something. For our party of six, the meal finally came and the last entree was delayed. We were not sure why since it was a pasta dish. \n\nNow on to the quality of food. The lamb was tough, the beef was tough. The seafood pasta dish was no big creative endeavor. We cook much better at home. It is an Italian restaurant and we had to ask for Parmesan. Overall we dumped two hours. I am not a beer or wine drinker so that was a very long time to wait for me to get a real cocktail after dinner.\n\nThe atmosphere is nice. There is only one shared restroom and when I left it there was a line of 4 waiting to use it.\n\nBunky made our family funky."
0,"Visiting old part of vegas during their Motor Bike Fest was a bad idea lol...Jammed packed line up past the door, Tony Roma's was the food place to be! located across from the Golden Nugget.\nThe service was an overall 2/5, there was mass confusion at first as we had three different servers coming to us.\n\nSampler platter 3.5/5\nPotato skins with bacon, cheddar was delightful.  The wings were nice and spicy!!! and their mozarella sticks were pretty yum.\n\nPrime Rib: $8.95 special 3/5 which included baked potatos and veggies.  Presentation was there, however not the best prepared...\n\noverall this place was grungy, and quite noisy. Though this place wont break your wallet in terms of price, but you;ll have to sacrifice the service and quality.  HOWEVER this place was packed...."
1,"Forget \""Las Islitas\"" that spot is just a hype...Mariscos Playa Escondida has the best seafood/mariscos in the WORLD!  Los aguachiles estaban bien perrones! The tostada mixta was bomb too! Reasonably priced! this is your spot for the cruda! Trust me!! \n\nSincerely,\nA very satisfied customer!"
0,"Our group decided to go to Surrender since we were able to get on the guest list.  We came here just before they closed the guest list, so we were able to get in without having to pay much.  You would think on a Saturday night this club would be poppin but I guess not.  There wasn't much people there and the DJ was just really bad that night.  First time here and probably going to be the last.  The dance floor was super small, and the DJ was bad.  Drinks were the usual price of 10-15 dollars each.  There is only one restroom on the outside as well.  Nothing seemed to impress me here."
0,"I REALLY wish there were reviews for 1NS from last year. Unfortunately (like the 10+ people who wrote reviews), I feel COMPLETELY ripped off, with the WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE EVER. \n\nI would NEVER use 1NS group EVER AGAIN!!!!!! \n\nAll the details that others provided are real and legit. The customer service is good ONLY up to the point that you buy them. It says that refunds are available if you contact them before EDC for bus shuttles only, but no one responds. \n\nIf you're going to take a shuttle, highly recommend the OFFICIAL insomniac one. Yes, maybe the lines will be long too (but honestly, it's impossible to beat traffic unless you go early and leave early), but at least you know that it's reliable and will be running all night.\n\nPS. I love that they don't post their NUMBERS for anything so that you can never contact them and emails are easy to delete..."
0,"Service: Horrible. I suggest you serve yourself. That includes finding a sink to wash your own glass in, cause it ain't gonna be clean when you get it.\n\nFood: Make sure you know where the nearest urgent care is. Hope your deductible isn't too high. Getting your stomach pumped isn't so bad though, is it?\n\nManager: Doesn't know, doesn't care, doesn't have a brain.\n\nBooze: Cheap if you can get served. Which you can't. \n\nMusic: Two kinds, so loud you can't talk, and doesn't work at all.\n\nMake sure you check your bill. And your credit card statement. Daily after you go here, cause chances are someone else is using your credit card number after your visit.\n\nAtmosphere: Freezing cold, all the time. I recommend layers."
1,"I came here on the recommendations of a friend for $3.99 steak and eggs. The deal lasts from 11-6 am so definitely come for a cheap eat. There are no substitutions either. \n\nThe thing that I remember the most is that nobody said thank you the entire time I was there. I said hello to the host and all he said back was how many. The guy who took our drink order just stood there and said drinks? Our waiter said what would you like to order. So I am definitely not overexaggerating when I say there was no hellos, no pleasantries, nothing. \n\nIt wasn't to just me either. Everyone was equally rude to everybody. Maybe because it was a little before 6 and they were tired. Maybe the smoking gets to you and you become mad at everyone. Whatever the case this place needs a customer service overhaul. \n\nNow I've got that out of the way, the food is decent. The steak was a nice size. I was very pleased for $4. I got it well done and it wasn't burnt. It had a nice charbroiled flavor. I needed to add salt and pepper, but I was very satisfied. The toast was good as well. They came lightly buttered and you can add jelly. I liked them with or without the jelly. \n\nThe hashbrowns were amazing! They tasted like they were cooked in butter! I have never had hashbrowns out this good. I traded my eggs for hashbrowns with someone at my table and I was in hashbrown heaven!\n\nI will definitely be back! Even with bad service, nothing comes close to steak, potatoes, eggs AND toast for $4!"
1,"It truly is a heavenly experience to find delicious food in Las Vegas away from the strip.  We found this restaurant on a random website and it is wonderful!!  We brought a bottle of wine to cork, but I my husband was so thrilled with the wine list that we bought one of theirs.  So many different flavors and tastes.  Amazing service with a very knowledgeable staff.   I would go back again and again!  Take a few friends with you so you can order more dishes to share!  \n\nLOVED IT!"
1,"I came here for Whiskey Wednesday, which is 50% off select whiskey flavors. If you don't know what that is, then you have to make sure you check out ALL of the discount alcohol nights at Seven Saints because they are all deals you should take advantage of!\n\nThe whiskey I got was Snake River Stampede. Mainly because I thought it was funny that it was considered a \""rodeo whiskey\"" and also that the description for it said \""this whisky can still kick like a bucking bronco when served neat.\"" haha.\n\nAnother nice thing is that they alcohol menu has two featured House drinks and a description for both. This makes it a bit easier while choosing a drink and you don't have to ask the waitress/waiter about every single drink. Even though my server was nice enough to do it if asked.\n\nI got the Triple \""S\"" Platter (Slider, 1/2 Salad, and a Side). I got the cheese slider, 1/2 Caesar salad and waffle fries. I liked all the food. Their waffle fries were really good.\n\nUp until I tried Seven Saints, I only thought of sliders as the little burgers you get from White Castle, but Seven Saints is now my favorite place to get them. I'll definitely be back soon."
0,"I had not gone here in at least 5 years,\nI remember the only decent thing being Lahori Fish.\nI also remember the waiter the last time telling us the Butter Chicken was not good and to go to an Indian restaurant if we wanted that.\n\nI went with 2 Pakistani friends, a little apprehensive since I've lived over 25 years and Parc Extension and I know Greek and South Asian spots here like the back of my hand.\n\nMy friend assured me it was great the last time he went, so off we went.\n\nThis used to be a Greek restaurant a while back and they kept the nautical decor, What bugs me every time is we are not allowed near the window, it's practically segregated for families only (ie. women and children) and man stay closer to the kitchen.\n\nThe food was just bland and not fresh, every dish disappointed, the chicken karahi was full of bones and the sauce separated from the oil (re-heated).\n\nThe lamb byriani was also underwhelming with the meat chunks dry and chewy.\n\nA lentil dish was practically untouched, the naan with raita was quite good.\nThe waiter just shrugged  when we told him the best thing was the bread.\n\nAbout 50 bucks for 3 dishes and 6 naan's (we were starving and it was the only good thing). The prices are a bit higher than elsewhere (they are hidden away on the second floor, there for many years so their rent must be cheaper)."
1,"Super fun and sexy club! Loved the Cirque Du Soliel performers when you first walk in and then when they actually perform... watch out, way fun! Great music, EDM style with some slight generic tunes mixed in. We were on the guestlist, got right in (go early!), I got couple drink tickets (yay), drink prices comparable to Vegas prices all over. Places to stand/relax and even set drinks down to dance when the floor was too busy. New FAVORITE nightclub hands down!!!"
0,"I didn't go to Guitar Center expecting good service, and I got exactly what I expected.  I was visiting Phoenix for a week, so I decided to go to Guitar Center to look for a cheap acoustic guitar.  I was happy to find one that played reasonably well and came with a gig bag for only $75, so I decided to purchase it.  There were three employees standing around talking to each other, so I went to the first one and told him I'd like to buy the guitar.  \""Oh, you will need to go to this guy over here.\""  He was nice enough to actually carry the guitar to the other person, who was on the phone, and let them know I wanted the guitar, but, not only was the other guy on the phone, he also had another customer he was helping.  I waited about 10 minutes, while the other employees were still standing around talking to each other.  Then I left.  Guitar Center needs to learn what I call \""Rob's First Rule of Retail,\"" which is, \""If you have someone who wants to give you money, make it easy for them to do that.\""  It's not that 10 minutes was a long time to wait, although I have no idea how much longer I would have waited, it just galls me that you have three people standing there doing NOTHING while I am standing there like an idiot waiting for the one person who is doing any work there.  Sure, I'm only spending $75 THIS TIME, but next time I may be in there buying a high $$ item.  Enough ranting. . .Guitar Center sucks. . .I will probably do what I should have done in the first place--get the guitar off of Craigslist."
1,"Got served by Jenni herself who was personable and professional.  We ordered the spring roll priced great at $3.50 an order, and five Pho (the house special and vegetarian.  The veggie pho is not on the menu and was served with beef broth and piled high with about six different vegetables.   Jenni apologized profusely and gave us free boba drinks when she realized that the servers forgot to bring us our pho x 10 mins.  That's sincerity I haven't seen or expected for a long while.  Comfortable seating, clean bathroom, nice wait staff.  I definitely recommend."
0,"I recently stayed here for the first time. Instead of writing a paragraph here is are some reasons why my stay here was let's just say less than perfect:\n\n-unfriendly staff, seems like no body likes their job here...\n-cleanliness of room was a disappointment\n-no early check in, you must pay a fee, and after you pay this fee don't be surprised if they put you in an unclean room only to have to move you \n-security guards take their jobs way to serious\n-pool is crowded w no seats and limited cabanas\n\npositives:\n-cheap, but I guess you get what you pay for\n-centrally located\n-margarita ville"
0,I probably didn't pick the right item...  I got the gyro and wasn't impressed.  The only thing impressive was the size.  It was sadly very lacking in flavor. \n\nExtra star for the fact that I had their roast beef sandwich as an Ironman Arizona volunteer and that one was good. But nothing I would write home about.
1,"So far I've had the Angry dog, Buckeye dog, and the Philly dog. Along with the kimchi fries and euro fries with fried egg. Everything's been top notch. If heaven had sex with a pig, 9 months later, a Buckeye dog would come out."
1,This is one of my favorite Burlesque shows to attend here in Vegas. It is very authentic and always a great time. The performers are both local and out of town ladies and gentlemen and they are all completely different to one another which keeps us on our toes. You never know exactly what to expect from the next performance. They also to theme nights and I love that idea! It's a great time.
1,"Our group of five was looking for a quiet, local place to enjoy dinner.  We could not have asked for a better location.  The view, simply amazing.  The atmosphere, quirky and vibey.  The salads were gorgeous and tasty.  The appetizers looked like a Top Chef quick fire challenge winner.  The entr\u00e9es were almost flawless.  \n\nI personally had the filet mignon and loved it.  Everyone had dessert.  Visually, if they tasted half as good as they looked, Vu is a shining star in the Fountain Hills area.\n\nOnly complaints:  Everyone had to keep asking for refills when the server could easily see in the empty glasses in the 1/8 filled restaurant.  Getting information via phone since they share the line with their salon and boutique.  I couldn't get immediate info and had to call back."
1,"I was on my way out of town and I swung by my dads to give him a kiss goodbye before I left.  As I pulled in, my check engine light came on.  My auto guys are in the east valley where I live so I hopped on my Yelp app and found Honest-1 Auto care.  \n\nI was in and out in less than 30 minutes.  The issue was completely benign and doesn't effect my vehicles performance.  I was relieved and delighted that they didn't tell me it was something that needed to be fixed ASAP just to make money."
0,I'm so mad I wasted a penny here! These cupcakes were disgusting. I got it for my sons birthday and couldn't eat them. I don't recommend this place to anyone. There's only one location and I see why...
0,"Another Yogurtland that failed in training their workers. The story is there is a new yogurtland app. After seeing the sign I Downloaded it to get pt's on my phone. When I came back to get my point... The girl at the cashier changed from when we first came in.\n In the beginning it was all smiles & hellos....Colorful yogurtland rainbows\n***then later when we had an issue... all the attitude came out. When i asked her for a receipt. She lied and said that we didn't ask for it. \n\nWhen it turned out my hubsss had it in his pocket!! niceeee....\n\nThen they brought their Assistant manager later who also lied to us. Saying we can get our return later online. \""OHhhhhh hrmmm did they train me? I think you can click that link\"" Yeah, that's for filling out a survey totally unrelated. \nThe whole staff here gets a bravoooo for all that acting. \n\nIt really ruined the whole experience. With such noobs,  I'm not sure if i ever want to step foot in a Yogurtland again."
0,"My girlfriends and I were looking for a place with good food and a good vibe.  The cab let us out and not 2min later we were running back to catch it.  There's a good chance we should have given it more of a try...\n\nThere were people that appeared to be in their late 60's flooding out of the restaurant. Now, I'm not saying there's anything wrong with that but a couple hot ladies looking to have some fun....not so much.  It looked pretty cute on the inside maybe it was someone's birthday or a celebration...\n\nThere's a possibility I'll go back one day, I may wait a few decades.  Unless someone convinces me otherwise. :)"
1,"As to what Susy C. said, I too loved their bathroom. Super spacious, and it made me feel like a baller for a day or three.\n\nClean rooms, large beds and a great view. What else can you ask for?"
0,"If you would like to get ripped off, please continue to dine at this establishment.  If not, take your business elsewhere.  \n\nTwo days ago, I stopped in and asked for half a pound of BBQ pork.  The man places a piece of meat onto the scale and it read: .46 lb.  Ok, so at $8.95/lb and I'm getting .46/lb, it should be $4.12.  By the time I get to the cashier, she tells me the total is $6.62.  WTF?!?!?  Did I get charged for having it sliced into smaller pieces?  So I ask the cashier, why it was so expensive because the man told me it would be $4.12.  She tells me, \""It's the tax\"".  So I pay and leave because I'm so hungry.  On the drive home, I look at the receipt and notice she charged me $6.12+$0.50 tax!! The man wrote $6.12 on the container so he was obviously trying to pull a fast one on me.  How effed up is that???  It doesn't matter if it was a $2.00 or $200.00 difference, it's the principle behind it and you guys screwed up big time!  AND I don't care how good (in this case, bad) your food was, but I don't appreciate being taken advantage of and NEVER, ever will I go back to your store again!!!"
0,Stopped by mid afternoon on Sunday and ordered salad and cocktail. Food is good and enough to take home.  Only issue is male server kept calling me sweetie or sweet heart.  Which I noticed he did to all female guests.
0,"I came to this cleaners for a bridesmaid dress to be altered and I was extremely happy with it.  Since I live close by I figured I would try the Dry Cleaning side of.  I will NEVER EVER come back to this place again.  I feel like I was totally ripped off.  \n\nI dropped my clothes off on a Thursday and she said to pick them up on Tuesday.  (Open all weekend so why so long).  I came in today Tuesday at 4pm.  She told me they JUST STARTED working on my items and she would call me when they would be ready.  1 hour later she said they were ready.  I picked them up, took them home and this is when I get heated.  \n\nMy Herve Leger dress I dropped off was the only thing that looked cleaned.  I had black shoe polish stains on it from an event I had attended and lucky for me they came out and the dress looked brand new.  I made such a stink about this dress to the older Asian lady at the front of the store, she knew I was going to make sure this dress was spotless when I came back.  All my other shirts still had water stains on them and they looked dirty still.  It looked like all my other items were just pressed so they looked like they were treated.  I think they ran out of time and got lazy and so they cleaned the Herve Leger dress and just pressed the other items to save time and to rip me off! I called as soon as I got home and noticed all of this and the same lady played dumb with me.  She said I could come back the next day and they would fix it but as I told her before, I was going out of the country and needed these items.  She then said to bring them in when I get back and they will correct the issue but to be honest, after reading others reviews on this place, I do not trust Sparkle Cleaners.  I'll take a loss on this and go back to my other dry cleaners across town.   Save yourself the trouble people!!"
1,So whenever I go to the miracle mile (every Wednesday)  I always hit up American apparel and urban. This particular store is really neat and organized and I always see the same girl working there. She's really nice and attentive which is completely opposite of what you'd expect. :)
1,"This place is sweet, I highly recommend it.  When you walk in the door be sure to look down at the floor because you're standing on a fish tank - pretty cool.  The decor is very trendy and the atmosphere is chill.  We had a drink at the bar on a Weds. night before heading out to the patio for dinner - not overly crowded which was nice.  The sushi was delicious - quality pieces and very fresh.  My only complaint was the bathroom sink - while very cool looking, the faucets don't work unless you slam the handle in and then the water just sprays out sporadically.  This was a little messy but the rest of the experience was great."
0,"I have been goi g to Love a Pup for a year and left because of the uneven shave on my dogs, then I went back after taking my other dogs there for anal gland cleaning, well we took our fog in Saturday and she once again was uneven took my other dog into day and it was horrific what they did to her, then the owner Tiffany yelled at me telling me I'm never happy and then looked at my dog and said ya your right it's uneven after telling me it wasn't then on top of it they violated me dog by shaving her head to tail which they took that off too it was a Poole cut short and she looks horrible!!! I told Tiffany the owner that I pay a lot of money here she rolled her eyes and shook her head no and said no you don't. Well that's for sure I'm not going to be paying them any more Your Fired Love a Pup!!! Look at the horrible job they did which she was right on one thing she was confused I would never ask for this to happen to my dog!! So no stars for you Tiffany owner of LOVE A PUP"
1,"bigger that i thought it would be. plus you don't have to walk into a shopping center or casino/hotel to get to right off the strip. filled with things that people actually buy not like some of the other shops right off the strip that have tons of things that maybe once in a while someone buys. no dust collecting, clean and filled with Hawaii and Vegas souvenirs, candies, t-shirts, calendars, macadamia nut snacks, enjoy cold drinks and a break from walking the strip, etc."
1,"This was my third time at an Emeril restaurant, and once again I left feeling that paying $85 to eat dinner was perfectly justified.\n\nAppetizer: The traditional New Orleans gumbo.  Smokey, spicy, warm, and comforting.  \n\nEntree: Filet mignon, medium.  Crusted with just the right amount of spices, cooked to perfection, and crowned with a healthy pat of herb butter.  \n\nSide Dish: Country smashed potatoes.  Clearly filled with more butter and cream than I care to think about, skins left in (love that), and just melt-in-your-mouth delicious.  \n\nMy friend's side dish: Bacon & cheese grits.  I normally don't like grits, but these were nice and well...gritty, not runny or gloppy.  Add bacon and cheese...c'mon.   \n\nDessert: The best part of the meal.  Wait--probably the best part of my entire Vegas trip.  Warm pecan pie with an oatmeal shortbread cookie crust, topped with homemade vanilla ice cream and caramel sauce.  Just...wow.  The pecans were chopped into manageable pieces, the filling was not overly thick and cloying, and I could have eaten the crust by itself and been happy.  I had a taste of my friend's chocolate bread pudding, which was gooey and intensely chocolatey, but not too sweet.  (It tasted like a combo of semi-sweet & bittersweet.)\n\nDrinks: Pretty good.  They don't have a specialty cocktail list since they are very into being a traditional steakhouse, but my pineapple martini was nice.  \n\nDecor: Very bare bones- the plain beige walls have no art on them, but that allows you to notice the very ornate architecture of the place, with high ceilings and arches everywhere.  I was too into my food to really care what it looked like though.\n\nService: As always with Emeril's restaurants- impeccable.  We had no less than 3 people taking care of us at all times: one to take our orders, one to bring our food, and one to take it away.  \n\nTip: SHARE an entree.  I split the 9.5 oz. filet mignon with my friend and I'm glad I did.  The average portion is enough for 2 or 3 people."
0,"When parking uptown, they are really your only option.  Which is fine, as some of their lots have reasonable rates.  My reason for the low review comes from the user experience side of thing, and their overall customer service.\n\nMy main problem with them (aside from rude people), is that there is no way to update your payment information online.  My credit card was cancelled, and upon receiving my new card (mid-March), I called immediately to update my information so, come April, they would have updated information.  Obviously I would have much rather done this all online, but alas, there was no other option but to call.  They assured me that the new card was placed on file, and we were good to go.  Fast forward to April 5th, and I receive an email saying that my card did not go through and I would be fined an additional $25.  THEY HAD CHARGED THE WRONG CARD.  They sent me this email on Saturday afternoon, and I immediately called, only to be told that the people who handle payments don't work on weekends and I would need to call back during business hours (the girl could have been a lot nicer).\n\nI call first thing Monday morning, and explain what happen--not in an accusing tone by any means, because I'm well aware that the likelihood of the girl I was speaking to having made this mistake was slim, so why yell at the messenger?  She immediately responded in a defensive tone, saying there is no way that error could have occurred, and it was my fault for not giving them the new information.  I tried to explain again the course of events, and she would not have it.  She updated my credit card information, now for the second time, so let's see if it goes through for May.\n\nOverall, here is how I feel:\n\n+Tremendous amount of parking options offered in Uptown\n-Poor customer service\n-Poor user experience\n-Overpriced\n\nIf you're going to take hundreds of dollars for me every year, at least give me decent people.  And if you don't give me decent people, then give me a way to do what I need to do online so I don't have to deal with them."
1,"I have eaten here twice and highly recommend it if you're a fan of savory bagels.\nThe first time I went here I had an everything bagel with cream cheese and a coffee. Both were very good. They have quite a few coffee options: 6 coffees and various creamers/milks, including vanilla half and half, which I used. I got my friend an egg and cheese on a bagel and everything seemed to be made fresh. \n\nI would not rate them 4 stars for the blueberry bagel I tried the next visit (though the strawberry cream cheese was very good). The coffee was, once again, very good. They also do free refills on the coffee, which is pretty fantastic. This time, I ate there and noticed they have some really interesting cream cheese flavors that I look forward to trying on future visits. \n\nThe service was really nice both times. The people working here were enjoyable and the food was ready quickly."
0,"We come here a lot. Not anymore. The manager/server/resident 'I don't care' girl....horrible. Literally horrible service. This place is being run into the ground. Owners should really take notice and make a change. You don't want a smart, rude employee, especially in this capacity. Food came out wrong, some wasn't even brought out until 15 minutes after everything else. Tried to give us free dessert, no thanks. Literally told us she didn't care when we complained about her service and our orders being wrong. Then....she put a gratuity on our check-this is no longer a legal practice. Hasn't been for months. It's a shame because the food is excellent.  The way we were treated was inexcusable. If I could give zero stars I would.  Owners will be getting a phone call."
0,"I'm totally astonished this place has 3 stars, maybe I'm picky but I don't qualify powdered eggs and $7 OJ as a 3 star joint.\n\nLine was long, it always is - don't let that fool you. It's long because it's really the only breakfast place in the Bellagio. There's the patisserie which is run & go...& the Pool Cafe, which is outside (Which by the way is the exact same menu & foods for the most part).\n\nWe sat at the counter so we could be seated quicker. The two waitresses running the counter were so tired & had very little help, I just plain felt bad for them. Most my guilt melted away though when I 'd ask for something & they seemed bothered by it!\n\nThe omelette....I got lobster, it IS Vegas afterall. I think there was probably 6 pieces in all and the eggs were easily mass produced, the cheese had barely melted which makes me question the fat content. \nWe ordered OJ, were shocked later that it was $7. NO OJ is WORTH $7! It's not like they were slaving away squeezing it by hand! \nI honestly enjoyed my toast most of all with all my little jelly jar choices along with my coffee, which was incredibly tough to get cream for.\n\nThis is a produce-in-bulk-to-get-the-customers-gambling-again kind of establishment. Nothing was worth coming back for. LIke I need to wait in a line for poorly made food. \n\n2 Stars instead of one because I didn't have indigestion or get poisoned, Whoo-Hoo for not kiling me!"
1,"When my wife and I walked in, we looked around and viewed a site that made our eyes perk and our mouths water. Designed in a mode that is cool, eclectic, and visual--you are taken on a quick pace to your table.  Once seated, the menu challenge begins.  I say that because of its diversity and taking the time to decide what you really want to order.\n\nScanning the menu--we both made our own decisions on what to try.  My wife ordered the Heart and Seoul Burger.  It is laden with a variety of items (avocado, kimchi, onion strings, a farm fresh fried egg, and furikake-wasabi-mayo) with its ground Angus marinated in Sriracha and soy sauces.  I, always having a traditional burger desire, received their Standard Angus Burger which had lettuce, tomato, onion, and Louie sauce.  Both burgers had brioche buns with the name \""I Love Burgers\"" implanted in them.  \n\nHaving been to Vancouver, and enjoyed them, we asked for Poutine Fries.  These are a delight within their own.  Golden french fries covered with brown gravy, mushrooms, and carmelized onions could have been a meal unto itself (we asked them to leave the cheese off since I am lactose intolerant).\n\nFor dessert, we had a piece of lavish chocolate fudge cake that ended our meal on a high sumptuous peak!!\n\nSummary:  The burgers were truly a pure delight!!  My wife never once stopped eating hers and enjoyed every element of it.  Mine was one that could always be used to show how a traditional American hamburger should be cooked and created. I want to compliment their manager, Mark, for coming to check and see how things were going and our waitress, Ashley, who made sure everything was in place.\n\nAs a burger buff, I can say, if you love burgers, you will love \""I Love Burgers.\"" The food, quality, service, and environment makes this a stop you will always want to hang out at when heading to Vegas (unlike gambling--every dollar you spend here guarantees to make you a culinary winner!!)"
0,"Baton Rouge, went for a lunch party with family. We were placed at the big table and arrived fairly early. Our table was the first to have our order taken. While waiting for the food we watched all of the tables around us getting their soups, followed by their meal. We received our soups and then more waiting.  The potato soup with cheese and bacon was good. Looking around it seems everyone else is working on their last bites. While the waitress was going around refilling water she didn't\n refill my side of the table, I guess because we were out of reach and couldn't be bothered to ask if we would like more.\n\nMy mother was going to go talk to someone but I opted to go for her instead, she is way too intense. Told a waiter that we didn't get our food yet. He replies: \""perfect, I'll let them know.\""\nI didn't like his response, I didn't think it was perfect that we had to wait 2 hours before we got our meal.\n\nI went to speak with the floor manager, let him know that we've been waiting. \""Listen, we have 122 people to serve and we're trying to convenience everybody.\""\n\nI understand that but we did arrive early but waiting 2 hours is ridiculous. Your foods coming out now. It better be after 2 hours.\n\nMy cousin who organized the event got his food just before us. Blows my mind how this place works.\n\nReceived our Rib Sandwich, mine was alright but my gf kept picking out bones from hers.\n\nThe waiter came over to apologize for the long wait, explaining how there's 120 people and all the chefs are freaking out. I was in the middle of writing all of this when he came over to apologize. He was cool and i dont blame him. No matter, I'm still angry it took that long and the manager would rather give an excuse then apologize. \n\nAfter everyone finished eating we got coffee. My mom went to put the milk in her coffee and it was a big lump. Expired milk with their coffee."
1,Favorite sushi spot in chandler! Could use some better lunch specials tho!! Maybe a Poke salad like RA... Just sayin
0,"I had a bad dining experience here and will likely never go again.  Oddly enough, I went in the first place because of good reviews I read here on Yelp.  Needless to say I was suprised with bad service, and burned food that was tasteless!  I had a grilled pimento and cheese sandwich with fries.  I know that the couple sitting next to me and my wife were not happy either."
0,I hate grocery shopping. Had to get something to take to a get together and Von's was on the way. I should have just went back down the hill to whole foods. The fruit was not that good. But I guess you get what you pay for.
1,"This place is still as good as the last time I went to it.\n\nSo good, in fact, that we ended our night there both nights we were in Vegas. Sure, some of the performances were repeated. but we didn't care.\n\nI love the crazy wigged DJ they always have. The drink tickets this time were for a delicious vodka fruity drink they called The Devil Inside. It was awesome. And two drink tickets for each girl was great.\n\nThe first night we came in, we didn't have a promoter so we lied about our names on guest list because the front staff practically showed us the list. We got in no problem.\n\nThe second night we came much later, probably about 1 am. A promoter stopped us on the first story of the hotel and asked us if we were on the guest list, we weren't, so he led us up there and we got in under his name. Score.\n\nThe only bad thing about Rose Rabbit Lie for me is that the music is like old school mixed with EDM. I don't like old music very much. It's not as easy for me to dance to. So I was dancing a lot less here.\n\nBut overall, I really like Rose Rabbit Lie. We'll be coming here a lot more in the future too."
1,"The parking is disaster but the shops are nicely located and there are a large variety of stores. This mall is conveniently located to trader Joes, a library, and many other things so you only have to take one trip to satisfy all your shopping needs."
1,This place is a gem... More then a gem it is everything that is good about eating.\n\nYou smell this place before you see it.\nThe aroma is mouthwatering.\n\nThe meat is perfect. If Francis mallman were here he would shake Anthony's hand. I have never tasted a more well balanced chimichuri.\n\nThank you for added this to the Pittsburgh landscape.  Bottom line. The food and service will change your taste buds forever.
0,"The worst service ever. Over priced, mediocre and bland sushi. Not even worth the happy hour"
1,Ok truth is this really a restaurant that doubles for a place that makes beer.  Beer is not that great...Come here because I am loyal to Craft Works brands. Our bartender Chris is fantastic... He us funny energetic and works his tail off behind the bar . Makes it work coming here.... Be sure to Ask for him as he is a server as well
1,"I have never experienced Hawaiian food until I moved to Vegas about 2.5 years ago and while leaving Walmart I decided to give this place a try. I had no clue what Hawaiian food was so i felt like i would take a risk and see what they had to offer. I was so surprised it's not that different from our food the things we tried was the bbq chicken and, my husband got the seafood platter. The many visit we made since then we tend to stick with what we like so we ordered the same thing. One thing that surprised me was the macaroni salad, this stuff is amazing!! its the first thing i eat each time. I ordered my same today and my husband as well but one of the meat choices he changed to was kaluah pig with cabbage, it was so delish perfectly seasoned and cooked it's now one of my favorites. The place is always clean and the staff is friendly and you don't feel rushed to order your food."
1,"Grew up in L.A. Been to Roscoe's a ton of times and had more than my share of Chicken and Waffles. I've been to LoLo's several times and will go back again for sure. Best I've had in AZ for sure!\n\n Chicken is excellent, collars greens are top notch, corn bread is phenominal and anywhere with Kool-Aid ON TAP deserves a visit! Very, very good overall...but it could easily be AMAZING!\n\nI wanted sooooooo badly to give this place 5 stars...I am a soul food junkie!!! But I just couldn't do it. Food quality is great and the staff is friendly...but the prices are pretty high. With just myself and my 8y/o son:$45+. \n\nAlso, I was sadly disappointed with the waffles. They are flat and often come out luke-warm. A \""Chicken and WAFFLES\"" spot should not have that problem. Last but not least, the Mac'N'Cheese was bland and average at best. \n\nAs I said, LoLo's deserve a visit for sure...great grub without a doubt! Just bring your wallet."
0,"I'm giving them 2 stars only because the girl at the front desk was extremely nice and welcoming, I believe her name was Kyndra otherwise the rest of my experience should get less than 1 star. When I walked in I was the ONLY one there, I filled out my paperwork and watched as the front desk girl told the back that their next patient was ready. From that moment I waited 20 minutes to be called back. Now I would expect that and be ok with it with there was any other patients there but I was the only one. Then the MA took my vitals and took me back to another room and said the NP would be right in. 5 minutes into waiting in that room I could here all the conversation going on outside of my room since there is no background music going on. It was the NP talking about the upcoming weekend with other employees in the office, who was going to buy her a drink, all complete nonsense. This conversation went on for ANOTHER 20 minutes while I was waiting in the room. Finally she came in my room barely introduced herself spent about 1 minute or less with me then left. The NP name was Lori- absolutely terrible. I would never go back. Stay far away from this place! There are many other great urgent cares out there with wayyyy better patient skills and employees that care about patients not just themselves."
1,I always get the Philly Cheesesteak with just meat and cheese. I have never been disappointed!
1,"Dr. McMahon is a very competent and compassionate dentist. One of the things I appreciate the most about her is that she does a very good job explaining everything to you and that she makes sure you have a really good understanding of any procedures or treatment recommendations. You know exactly what she is doing or recommending and why. She gives you the opportunity to ask any questions that you have and she never gets upset if you ask a lot of questions. I have also had two different hygienists at her office clean my teeth (I am sorry, I do not remember their names) and both were very pleasant and did a very good job making sure I was comfortable. The office is very clean and very comfortable. Her assistants are also very attentive and helpful. Bobbi the office manager is very professional and helpful with billing and insurance questions as well as scheduling."
0,So I wrote a review but it was filtered. I think people should know how awful this place is before stepping inside. I have no ties to this place; I don't know any of the other owners of shops in Shadyside and I am 100% un-bias and wrote my review purely on my experience there. Why was it filtered?
1,"My wife and I went there tonight.  The menu is simple, but the combination of food and flavor is perplexed.  We had a number of dishes and we liked most of them: Beef carpaccio (love the combination of parmesan and beef), quail on macaroni (tint of sweetness), duck tartare (very appetising with the capers), artichoke clams (instead of using lemongrass, the chef skillfully use the sourness of the artichoke in the broth), lobster tail, garlic shrimp, seared scallop (cooked just right) and passionfruit dessert with crumb base and chocolate ganache (this is my wife's favorite)\n\nThe bill comes to $75, which is not too bad knowing the food is exquisite and delicious.  But, don't be surprised by the wait time of the food and Pinto size of the dishes, the two of us were pretty full from the meal :) By he way, the staff were friendly and helpful."
1,Really good! We eat there frequently and it is consistently good. I'd give it a 5 but I tend to rate too high I think.
0,"Cafe Republique Rue Peel location is unethical.  My credit card information was stolen from this location and $1,000 of fraudulent charges were charged to my credit card.  Go get yourself an education, ethics and learn how to spend your own money.  Don't go around spending other people's hard earned money.  Karma is a bitch."
0,I just moved from SF to Scottsdale and went to this gym to check it out. I met with a membership person by the name of khieser and all his only motive was to sell me a membership that day. He was a used car sales person working in a gym. I asked him to see if I could try the gym for a couple of days and he said no they don't do that. He lied... Later I checked on there website and they offer a 7 day free pass. Anyways horrible customer service.
1,"First of all... Ninos by far deserves these 5 stars! This place is the epitome of why I LOVE local, hole-in-the-wall restaurants. Before I get into the delicious food, their service is exceptional. From order to walking out, these business owners know how to treat their customers. \n\nA friend of mine was craving legit Greek food when I stumbled upon this Yelp profile and Ninos was conveniently down the street from us. This place is probably in a more remote area of the Biltmore area, along 16th Street. It is a charming house with a good amount of tables inside and some bench tables outside. Our party of 7 were the only patrons at the time, so were served in a timely manner and all our food came out in about 15 minutes which to me is great considering our party and number of orders. I believe our party ordered pretty much every single platter on the menu (gyro, lamb, chicken breast, falafel) and each platter comes with pita bread, salad, rice, AND fries with side of tzatziki sauce for less than $10 each. I had the pleasure of trying each platter (yes, I'm THAT person) and oh my goodness... SO SO GOOD! Every meat has great flavor and every element on the platter is delicious and fresh. \n\nHere's what sets Ninos apart: they made a mistake on my order of a gyro plate, or rather they did not hear it. Everyone else had got their food and when I asked if my gyro plate was coming, they quickly apologized and said it was coming up. I then looked at my receipt and realized they did not bill me for it. When I told them it wasn't paid for and not to bother because I had more than enough to share with my boyfriend and parents, they insisted on making my gyro plate at no cost. Of course I gave them a hefty tip - what I would have paid for the gyro plate. They deserved it! And that's not all. They ran out of rice for my platter and in consolation, gave us a hummus appetizer on the house! Needless to say, our entire experience was excellent. They were so generous and attentive - gave us so much more than what we asked for and expected in terms of side sauces, additional pita bread, and drinks. And most importantly, one of THE BEST Greek food joints in Phoenix. Hands down. I definitely will be a regular here. THANK YOU YELP and YELPERS for this successful find!"
0,"This was the second restaurant we checked out in the Oakland/Pittsburgh area. A university event was being held there so too many people in too small a place. But not to worry, no stars taken off for that since it wasn't the restaurant's issue.\n\nA buffet was set up with green salad, pasta with an alfredo suace, and another pasta dish with a marinara sauce.everything tasted like authentic, kitchen-made talian dishes (e.g. not out of a box or bottle, but ), so that was good. There was pizza too but I did not try it.The atmosphere wasn't great and I am not sure they had air conditioning which is brutal when it is hot and muggy out.\n\nI have no idea about the prices, and didn't even talk to a server...\n\nWould I go there on my own? Eh, maybe...just to give it another try in a different situation so I can experience it as a 'normal' customer."
1,This quaint little place is a gem in Old Town Scottsdale.  The oven brick pizzas are amazing and the wine selection is great.
0,"Manager is the worst I have ever seen for customer service. He DOES NOT CARE what you think or need. Do Not buy at this location, and be very wary at any Sears Outlet store as I found out after talking to Sears Corp customer complaint office that Outlets operate under \""Different\"" rules and polices than the rest of the Sears stores.  Translation - Outlet managers should be looked at like used car salesmen, they will tell you anything until the sale is final then you play hell getting anything from them.!"
1,"We went w/ some friends to see the Dark Knight here recently. Dont let the blandness of the concessions lobby fool you, youre in for an \""experience\"" (cuz they call it the IMAX experience, get it?). Its a Harkins (basically) so you can use your souvenier cups. The concession staff was very friendly. They even had our hot food made and brought over from the regular Harkins in AZ Mills cuz they didnt think theirs would be ready in time for us to catch our movie.\n\nThe actual theater is very daunting. That screen is HUGE! Careful, the stairs are very steep. We had seats in about the middle of the theater. The sound quality was great. It was a great way to see a great action flick. Not sure I'd opt for Imax everytime, but for this film it was worth the extra $."
0,"Got tickets for a friend's birthday on a Friday night. There were 8 in our group, and 2 of our friends forgot to purchase tickets online so the bouncer wouldn't let them in to purchase tickets. After they were kicked out of line, I asked another employee (maybe a manager?) where to purchase tickets, and he pointed to the back of the line that we were all JUST standing in. No one was helpful, and was altogether very neglectful and uncompromising. Plus, the ticket was not worth $25. Nothing new to see here, music wasn't even the DJ's original, and was a basic mix at most. Would've had the same experience at the other clubs for much less, plus more accommodation. \n\nThe best part were the mermaids dancing from the ceiling. Although half the time it looked like they were just tangled in their nets. An extra star for mermaids, though."
1,"If you want mediocrity DaLonnie's is not the place for you. However....you do want excellence and world-class nails annnnnnnnnd prompt appointment service then Loni is the nail guru for you. \n\nLocated in a retail center off of Sunset, DaLonnie's Hair an Nail Studio is a one-stop destination for all of your beauty needs. I love this place!"
0,I know I really busted balls with this place the first go round but hell I'm a paying customer and I expect a little decency. So 1st go round I just left & never ate so to be fair I ordered for take-out some pork & rice with some little egg roll/taquitos Im not quite sure what they were other than overdone. The meat was pretty decent-real tender and looked good but not any flavor and the dipping stuff was kinda orange marmalade stuff. The jasmine rice was really dry and just flavorless which i guess most rice is but i like some soy or sweet n sour with mine. It cost me $9.50 and I was still hungry after eating this. Not good Not bad just plain and a little pricy.
0,"Don't waste your time or money here. First you have to wait in a line to order your desserts then they send you to another line to pay. Once you are waiting in line to pay they call you name you think its to pay for your order but they are just showing you your order after they have put it in the box. now you have just lost your spot in line and have to wait again for them to call your name for a 2nd time. The desserts were just OK, i have had way better. Worst of all they were extremely rude! I wanted to buy a kids shirt ,which they had on display. I asked for one and the girl just kept saying that they only had size small. I could see bins full of t-shirts. I asked if it was child's SM or adult and all she could respond with was \""its just small\"". I also was talking to another woman who was waiting. she only ordered 1 pastry and was there before we got there. she was still waiting even after i paid for my order. She asked what was going on and the girl behind the counter and gave her a dirty look and said \""I called your name like 10 times and you never came up.\"" Her name was never called. The employee just kept telling her that she should have been listening. All around poor experience."
0,Not surprised they closed. They never had any other customers when I was in the salon. The up front staff was not cordial or inviting.  The services were so-so and not what you would expect in an upscale salon.
1,"Straightforward, no-frills good eats. Tasty buns and green papaya salad. Easy, low-key vibe. Cute boys, too :)"
1,"This is a great dog park. There's a lot of room for them to go nuts! However, that in itself being great is also one of it's downfalls. I feel like I have to follow my dog everywhere to make sure he's not leaving surprises or having issues with other dogs. So I can't really relax here, but it is beautiful."
0,"Usually love this place but service kind of ruined it for me\n\nWas there w a group of ten, we are all very low maintenance and from the get go the server was frustrated w us. Wanted to order appetizers as entree, he refused and said he would only take appetizer orders, he was also asked to split checks which was ignored. When he came back I asked him again if we could split checks and he then very condesendingly he said that if he was told at the beginning he would of but now its too late and at this point \""I'm not going to begin to find out who is with who and who is on what check\"". Water was refilled once.\n\nVery disappointing considering we are all very easy patrons and we all have really liked this place in the past..\n\nFiguring out the bill was a nightmare and I ended paying way more than I should have for what I had eaten.\n\nGood food but not sure if ill be back"
0,"I met a social group here last night for our monthly meet up. This was My 1st time @ Pizza-Re & was initially thrilled at the small space. Great for conversation.\nHOWEVER the pizza was mediocre. I love pizza & this was average tasting in My opinion. Fell along the lines of any pizza chain, pizza hut or domino's caliber.\nI was under the impression this was going to be some good gourmet pizza.\nThe prices were gourmet but the pizza was ehhhh, I can't believe I drove from Phoenix for this pizza.\nThey did have a low card option which was nice, but the only thing that was yummy was the cheese.\nThe pizza with crust seemed large in size and simply average in taste.\nThey do not sell alcohol but you can bring your own beer and wine, however they will charge you to open it!\nGreat environment for socializing, but I certainly was NOT impressed."
0,"While the sushi I had was great, I can't in good conscience recommend this place. They sell bluefin tuna which is highly endangered."
0,This was the worst philly cheese steak I ever had as soon as I discovered a metal bag tie inside the meat half way through eating the sandwich luckily I could spit it out before I started chocking on it and would have had to go to the hospital. This is not what I expected for an 11.99 plus tax sandwich. See attached picture
1,"Absolutely loved it!!!  Atmosphere, service, food, just about everything was perfect in this place.  Me and my wife had Chef's Signature tasting menu and everything was just cooked to perfection.  My only complain was we got there 5 minutes before our reservaton time and it took them another 15~20mins until we got seated.  Other than that, I highly recommend.  If you are not sure what to eat, just go with Chef's Tasting menu.  You will enjoy it and leave full and happy! :)"
1,"= = = = =  DAILY LUNCH & DINNER BUFFET!  = = = = =\n\nIt's taken me about 3 1/2 years to get back here, to the best of the Sweet Tomatoes locations in Arizona, at least.  This beautiful restaurant features big windows wrapping around almost all of three sides of the building, creating a cheery, airy atmosphere & doing so without allowing sun glare to intrude in at lunch time, all due to the terrific archetecture of the building... but do you like to actually dine outdoors?  If so, you'll find the covered, partially enclosed patio on the east side is just right too!\n\nAnother big plus for this particular Sweet Tomatoes is that Inside there is an opening between the dining room and the beginning end of the salad serving line, so you don't have to crowd past new customers to go back for more food in that area.\n\nOk, so I stopped in here early on this Tuesday to find the place filled nearly to capacity with cheerful, gabby customers.  (See photo).  After selecting from 48 salad items, including a really delicious Mandarin Spinach Salad with carmelized walnuts, I took my place in a just-right booth that I was fortunate to have become available right when I was ready to sit down.\n\nOver in the hot food and dessert serving areas there were 33 more items, not counting sauces, toppings and such.  I enjoyed some tasty Pozol\u00e9 with big chunks of pork in it.  YAY MEAT!     I followed up with bowls of good Cream of Mushroom and French Onion soups, the latter of which had the appropriate type of croutons and shredded Swiss Cheese right there to top it off properly.  There were also various bread offerings, fruits & desserts, and everything from start to finish was perky and fresh.     :-)\n\nDaily Lunch & Dinner Buffet:  $8.99/$8.09 Sr. (Rev. 11/26/13)\n\nThey're at the top of their game with this particular Sweet Tomatoes location & it was easy to give them 4 Stars for this fun lunch outing!     :-))"
1,"This is my favorite Mexican restaurant of all times.  Hot as it gets.  It's now an addiction that must be feed at least 2-3 times a month.  I favor the cheese enchilada dinner with green sauce. The margaritas are a call for the new light rail, cab ride or definite designated driver.  Strong stuff. My husband loves any of the pork dishes.  Always get a homemade tortilla. \n\nYes, there is a wait.  If you need to eat right away, go at 11am or 5pm."
1,"This place simultaneously makes me happy and freaks me out.  It's great to be able to find tons of (mostly Asian, but also some other ethnic) food items not available at most grocers.  This time, I enjoyed some new rice types (they have at least 10-20 varieties), interesting noodles (purple wheat?), Japanese rice seasoning and jamaican jerk marinade.  So far all have been a hit.\n\nThe freaky parts are the random fish heads floating in a bucket in the refrigerated section.  And other indecipherable items.  Yikes.  Prepare for some strong smells and potentially scary sights.  But really great prices on lots of ethnic cooking ingredients - totally worth it."
0,Overcharged and overfilled.\nThey insisted that my car required synthetic oil which I found out after was not the case.  They overfilled my car with oil resulting in my car leaking oil in the garage for many days in a row.  I am going to the dealer next time.
1,"Theres 2 chinese buffets on Craig road between MLK and Decatur and I prefer Little Dumpling over China Star, that's for sure.\n\nReason being? The quality is way better!  And they have more selection. Yeah they have your chinese buffet pizza, and fries and nuggets, but they also have frog legs, eggplant, beef ribs and other stuff you won't find at other Chinese buffets. One time I came there, just for the eggplant, they didn't have it, but they cooked a serving just for me! Now that's how you keep a customer happy.  They also have sushi and crab legs at dinner time.\n\nOne thing that always happens and never fails is that some selections aren't refilled for a long time. And it keeps people waiting.  Other than that, Little Dumplings over China Star any day."
0,"As mentioned before, the girls who work here are overwhelmed.slow service, drinks kinda crappy.food was ok and tables are run down and shoddy."
0,"This place is terrible.  The first time I went they couldn't do what I wanted.  Said it was company policy - ok, fine, not a big deal.  I wouldn't hold that against them but the employee I talked to wasn't particularly friendly.\n\nI went in yesterday to get a battery replaced.  I walked in at the same time as a family that had apparently already been in for service and came back to complain about something not working.  We waited a good 5 minutes before anyone came in to help us.  \n\nAfter they were finally dealt with he came back to see what I needed.  Told me it would be at least 15 before he could help me but checked to see if they had my battery.  He went back outside to finish what he was doing without taking any of my info.  \n\nThere were other people in the waiting area so I ended up having to sit under the TV.  I don't know what show they had on but it was Kyra Sedgwick repeatedly screaming and calling some woman a bitch in a terrible southern accent.  During my time sitting there people with kids were coming and going through the lobby, and I couldn't help but wonder why they thought it was appropriate to have this on.   I would have asked someone to change the channel but everyone was outside working on cars.  Don't get me wrong - I don't have delicate ears - but there are some things a responsible business just doesn't do.\n\nThe rest of the time was spent listening to the phone ringing incessantly, because, like I mentioned, everyone was outside.  \n\nI brought a book to read while I waited but between Kyra screaming and the phone ringing there would be no reading.  Instead I used my time to Yelp another nearby location with higher ratings.  I found one closer to my house and walked out.\n\nI won't come back."
1,"I virtually stopped going to Starbucks after discovering this local gem and repeatedly running into super-friendly owner, Tracy Danner. The coffee is amazing, the service is supreme, and the atmosphere is way more relaxed than a national chain. Try the bear claws which are literally to die for. Reasonable prices on whole expresso beans, too. I love this location because it's next door to other places I frequent and because it's a great gathering place for locals (thus always a hubbub of activity). But if you want a more relaxed venue with lots of locals who will invite you to join their daily coffee klatch, try the big table (or the couches) at EVP on the corner of Glenway & Mineral Point Rd."
1,"We tried shaved ice also for the first time. If don't have a sweet tooth baby size is way to go. Small size is kinda big for my wife and I. They have so much flavor flavor to choose from. It was pretty good shaved ice though. \nI'm only giving it 4 star because the customer service is good but not that great. \n\nMy wife noticed that the lady was kinda sarcastic in some way. It was our first, we were expecting to have explanation what's on that particular flavor or what not. \n\nYeah maybe we'll come back again."
0,"We had dinner there last night and were disappointed.  The food was okay - sort of on the bland side.  Had a marguerita that I had to send back because it had absolutely no taste.  The artichokes were just ok, as was the pizza I ordered.  My husband had halibut stuffed with salmon mousse and spinach - it was swimming in sauce and you wouldn't even know if it was fish or chicken.  We'd been looking forward to trying this place.  Won't go back again."
1,"My favorite place in Vegas in terms of getting away from tourist and \u00fcber-marketing. This place is a classic, and the food is excellent. If they have the King Salmon - get it. Cream corn was very good too. Only reason they don't get 5 stars: their Gulf Shrimp appetizer was just average. Sauces all ran together and only 1/2 the shell removed which was odd. Definitely stop by when you are in Vegas."
1,"I really like this place.  When I first went in a year or so ago, I was expecting a huge venue with rock climbing, so I was a bit disappointed.  However, the atmosphere there, the great service, and surprisingly good food make it worth while.  \n\nSome cool things we found out recently about this bar: 1. You can download their app to find out what the beers are that day (they have a large tap selection), which is pretty sweet. 2. You can order delivery for them through a local delivery company.\n\nGreat place you should go for either just a few drinks with some friends, or for some food out on the patio"
0,Its just ok. They didn't return any of my phone calls. The people that work there are definitely not friendly. very small space. The teachers are very good.
1,"First off, if you are using a Garmin GPS, forget about it. You wont find this place.  This is only the second time it has let me down but still.....you have to go way past where it tells you to go and you might as well ask and stop for directions.  Anyways.....we finally found out how to get here (Off Combs and Meridian) and decided to eat lunch. \n\nI saw a Best Thing I Ever Ate and Beau McMillan picked this as his favorite sandwich or something to that effect.  My wife and I both got the Kalamata sandwich and a fountain drink.  Damage for everything was $24 bucks and change.\n\nThey give you a little buzzer that goes off when your food is ready.  They have some seating inside, and a lot more outside.  We grabbed a seat and waited only about 5 minutes.  Picked up our sandwiches, got our drinks and went outside to grub down!\n\nFirst thing I noticed is that the actual sandwich was way way way smaller then what they showed on TV.   Once I bit in, the size didnt matter that much.  Anyways....this sandwich had 2 kinds of salami, capicola, provolone,arugala, tomato and a creamy herb dressing all on top of a crusty baguette.  The flavors were amazing!  It was a mighty fine sandwich and I devoured it in record time.  They also give you a big pile of kettle chips and a couple of olives. I washed it down with some homemade prickly pear lemonade which was delicious!  Overall it was a solid lunch.\n\nThey also have a gift shop where they sell different things like olive oil, stuffed olives, bread, cupcakes made with olive oil etc.  We decided to get a 500ml bottle of their garlic olive oil, some olive tapenade spread and my wife also picked up some lip balm/chapstick things too. \n\nIt was a nice little stop.  A tad on the pricey side for everything and not the easiest place to find keep this from being perfect.   Killer sandwich though!"
1,"We had a very enjoyable lunch at Dusit. The staff managed a busy lunchtime service, very well, and produced good dishes.\n\nOverall, we said: \""I was impressed with Dusit. I found it quite hard to compare with our other recent Thai quest, when we visited Siam Thani, as the two places are very different. I imagine this reflects both the diversity of Thai cuisine, and the differing approaches of the owners and chefs. I think both places merit a further visit, as I having a feeling that their evening menus are where they both shine more brightly. For sure, pay Dusit a visit, soon. You'll be very pleased with what you're served and how you're served it.\"""
0,"Man was this a disappointment!!!\n\nThis exhibit is fairly pricey - $20 for adults. There were no shows nor set feeding times for the dolphins; there are also no interactive exhibits like at Sea World. The exhibit for the dolphins is not beautiful and merely functional; it is also extremely sunny with little shade and little good seating.\n\nThe large cats exhibit was ok - prettier than the dolphins but disappointing nonetheless.  Large cats are most active in the early am and later pm. The park's hours, however, are only 10 to 6 (7, but the last entrance allowed is at 6). This is not the optimal time for the cats and they were all laying and sleeping during the hot day hours. \n\nTruly, this exhibit should just be free to guests, not pay, and certainly not $20 for adults!! You should skip this one unless you have never before seen a dolphin and this will be your only chance.\n\nOverall = Fail."
0,"So sorry ! my husband and I were so excited to try this restaurant, we drove a bit of a distance only to be throughly disappointed. The wait was about 35 minutes which we didn't mind we 15 minutes after we were seated for water and a server.  It was total confusion! Servers and bus people every where.  We had no silverware, we had to beg for coffee. I ordered the eggs florentine and my husband ordered eggs with corn beef hash.  While we were waiting for our food I noticed how  dirty the bus boys clothes were and one of them kept wiping his nose on his fore arm. Also there was a big guy in a black T Shirt that wiped his nose with the back of his hand. I was sick!  My husbands corn beef hash was very good but cold as was his dry toast. Mine was the worst florentine I have ever had, the hollandaise Sauce was so full of lemon that it made you pucker. I was not about to send it back. They asked if everything was ok and I told them that I could not eat it because of the lemon, they took it off our bill. I think Arizona is so desperate for non corporate, neighborhood restaurants that we sometimes over look the quality, I cannot over look dirty. CLEAN IT UP AND GET A REAL CHEF and try again.\n,"
1,"This was by far one of the best meals I've ever had in Vegas!  It was one of the first times I've ever gone off the strip for a meal and I'm sure glad I did.  The service was outstanding (our waitress was so sweet!), the food was spectacular, and we had a very private table in the back which made our experience so nice.\n\nWe relied heavily on other Yelpers in our ordering so we were impressed, like others, with the Angeldesh (sp?) tofu, kobe beef skewers, foie gras custard, seared foie gras, and something else that had uni, ikura, egg, mushrooms, and more -- that last dish might not be a great choice for a food newbie, but if you love adventurous weird food then you should definitely try it!  \n\nAll in all, a fantastic meal that rivaled even some of the best meals I had while travelling in Japan last year.  I will definitely be back, Raku!"
1,"take a left at treasure island and continue down spring mountain road until you reach the yummy goodness of ronald's donuts!\n\nclose your eyes and picture this:  two and 1/3 shelves devoted to VEGAN donuts...\n\ngo ahead. let that drool gather for a second of two.\n\nfor $1.75 i indulged in a maple bar and a chocolate cream filled donut--and both were outstanding. the frosting, particularly on the maple one, was coma inducing. my hypothalamus was galloping! the creamy center of the filled one was just like vanilla pudding, and the dough was light and airy.\n\nplus, the woman behind the counter gave me and my mister an utterly outstanding recommendation for a veggie friendly lunch spot--veggie delight, which had us making happy eating sounds for the duration. :)"
1,Located near Ross. Soo true about the decor looking like the 80s threw up in there. Bar with fireside pit accompanied by water. The restaurant itself has the whole diner vibe going on. While waiting for 50 mins we drank some mimosas (tasty) :D doesn't disappoint. The french toast collage was good but nothing out of the norm. The swiss and mushroom burger was huge and it was quite juicy. The waitress we had was friendly and prompt. Theres a little jar that has colorful sugar crystals on the table. The bacon was so crunchy and it was good quality bacon lol. Not that cheap clear bacon. Eggs were ordered over well and they got it just right! Definitely a must try when visiting Vegas!\n\nOh and btw they take and give you a complimentary picture :D
1,"This place lives up to the hype!!  Excellent, really fresh food.  Great service and super reasonable.  Not like the overpriced hibachi restaurants near and on the strip. My family and I will be regulars for sure!"
0,"This place does not deserve a star!  We drove out there specifically to watch our friend eat the B3 burrito from the Man vs Food challenge.  The day before, another friend specifically went to the manager and asked what needed to be done to accomodate the 3 would be challengers and the 20 people prepared to watch.  They said, \""Nothing.  Just show up\"".  Which we did!\n\nWe were told that they were too busy to make the 3 burritos and that we could check back in 1/2 hour.  Too busy?  Half the tables were empty and yet, they weren't too busy to try and take food orders for the 20 of us that went there to support our friends!   By the way, 1/2 hour later, they weren't any busier but still could not make the burritos.\n\nI will never go back there and tell all my friends to avoid it like the plague!  What a waste!"

0,"It's impossible to get appointment in this place. Specially when you mention that you bought your massage on Groupon or Living social. You just get treated differently, and i don't understand why.  The lady hang up on me 3 times now and promised to call back, never did. And while on the phone i hear walk ins can be scheduled any day, while for me they said it's 2 weeks wait, and still didn't make an appointment. Very upsetting, because the place seems very clean and nice, and i heard good recommendations about massages"
0,"The lounge was a little disappointing.  It had a sad 80's strip-club ambience.  It's supposed to be the #1 makeout spot in Vegas, but that's not the feeling I had there.  The tv's should've played something other than old bluegrass live performances."
0,"Today I had gone to this t mobile store to buy a new phone because I had just cracked mine. When I entered the store no one greeted me and there were two cashiers and another gentlemen in the back that kept coming out every so often. Originally there were only 3 customers including myself and 3 workers which made sense that I wouldn't be waiting to long to get my new phone. I got in line behind a person who was already in the middle of his transaction thinking it wouldn't be long while I got attended to. I kid you not 6 people walked in, in the course of me standing behind this one guy and no one offered to help me. I asked one lady and she told me rudely to hold on. Not till I almost walked out did another lady ask to help me. When I finally got her to grab what I needed she seemed careless and never acknowledged me because she was to busy conversing with her fellow coworkers. I was never so offended to not being helped. They had no professionalism nor common curtesy. Never again will I step foot at this tmoblie store. Almost made me want to cancel my phone."
1,"Very excited to have this as my neighbourhood sushi joint. Solid place for when you're after delicious raw fish, ethereal tempura, and some warm sake to make you extra happy."
1,"Not a very hip crowd. but  the BF and I went at a slow hour to watch the girlies. great stop after mesa and before sapphire.\n**we went to shadow bar again on friday night and it was swarmed with middle aged suburbians, most of whom were blocking our view. there was this one lady about 45 wow, she was trrrashed and dancing her ass off, fairly entertaining.\ni would recommend going at off peak hours."
1,"With a bit of time between checking out from the hotel and my departure flight, I needed a nibble. Joe's to the rescue with a hot and toasty panini sandwich. The dude (yes, dude is the right word here) spoke perfect English when I asked him what was good today. The spicy chicken was his recommendation and I grabbed a bottle of water to go with it.\n\nAnd then I went to my wallet. Oops - no Canadian cash left. No worries, he let me pay with American. Your mileage may vary.\n\nThe sandwich was excellent. The right size and with a good amount of chicken and spiciness.\n\nOn the minus side of the equation, there was no wifi in the place and the table where I sat was sticky. Minor details."
1,"Taking Trainer Jo's H.I.I.T. (High Intensity Interval Training) Bootcamp at City Athletic Club has done wonders with my body. She's a positive fitness instructor and makes people push their limit because she knows we can do it. It can be a challenging class sometimes, but in the end the results are worth it."
0,"Why did I agree to go here? BLAAAAAAH! Even for fast casual Japanese food, it sucked. I got the low-carb (no rice) teriyaki salmon bowl. The vegetables _ a mix of cabbage, broccoli and carrots _ had no flavor whatsoever. It was like hospital cafeteria veggies. Ever hear of salt or using a flavored broth? The sauce on the salmon was OK but once you eat off the top layer, no flavor inside at all. It was not worth $6.62 or whatever the price. I rarely go so far as to say \""Oh I could have cooked better at home\"" but in this case, it's true. One of the worse meals I can remember having. And their shiu mai dumplings obviously frozen and then cooked because a) way too labor-intensive otherwise and b) that had more flavor. How can it be next door to Cherry Blossom Noodle? I need a good meal to counteract this."
0,"I really don't get what all the hype is about.  The food is your standard buffet food: crab legs, prime rib, other seafood.  The quality of the food isn't great either.  I did like the osso buco and the fried polenta, but other than that the food was ...meh.  \n\nThe best parts of this buffet are the all you can drink beer and wine and the desserts.  \n\nExpect to wait at least 2 hours in line and have a bunch of people cut in front of you because they conveniently found family or friends in line ahead of you.  Make sure you check the closing time because sadly they still seat people when they're already taking food away from the buffet.  \n\nIf you're looking for a seafood buffet, head over to the Rio seafood buffet instead.\n\nOverall this is not the best buffet like a lot of the reviews have said.  Save your feet some grief and head to the Bellagio or Wynn buffet.  Way better food (at Bellagio they serve king crab legs sliced in half so you don't have to crack crab legs, and i've even had kobe beef there  before) and you won't have to wait a million hours in line.  Prices are about the same for weekend lunches and dinners."
1,"This tram is ONLY worth it if you're going from Excalibur to Mandalay Bay or visa-versa. If you're going to Luxor from either location, just walk (it's probably faster than waiting and riding the tram)"
1,"Turkey dinner is pretty good.  But the gravy was a bit too salty.  Next time will order it on the side.  \n\nThe Alaskan Waffle with Strawberries are my favor.  Warm waffle, vanilla ice cream and strawberries and whip cream.  So ooooo. Good!"
0,"This place is terrible. The facilities are nice, and so is the staff. However, I called in and asked about pricing they quoted me 695 to use the facilities for a Saturday afternoon. When we arrived the person reviewed all of the arrangement with us. When we asked what the total was coming up to he quoted us 1695!!!! This was a thousand dollar up charge from the price quoted. Unbelievable! We wasted two hours of the very little time we had to plan this funeral, with a place that lied about pricing to get us in the door. Very upsetting especially for a family who has very little time to plan a service to morn their mother."
0,Very rude people here I felt the pressured to buy the insurance and when I was exiting the place the worker made me run back and give him his stupid 10cent pen
1,"I love this place!\nThis is a hidden gem in uptown, it's a cozy place with good food and even better service.\nThe first time I went for lunch I ordered the Baja quesadilla and I almost cried because the chicken on it tasted like a dish that we eat in Mexico. Besides the quesadilla my other two favorites are two vegetarian sandwiches Fallafel and Jeniffer, I'm not vegetarian but they are delicious."
0,"Food is good but average in my opinion. Too many menu items. It's hard to do a great on a lot of menu choices. Limited bar options. I could not get a Manhattan, no vermouth!"
0,The recent renovations are great but has the service gotten worse? It took an hour for us to get our food. The simple pho I ordered had one piece of meat. I was disappointed cause usually this place is great. I hope it was just a bad day.
0,"I moved in a hurry and signed a 6 month lease I picked this place because they were so much less deposit then the rest of the places I had been to. I moved in and signed a pet lease in the lease it says at any time the can revoke it. Not thinking that would happen unless my dogs attack or become a problem in some way. I lived in the building next to the office. I have a lab mix witch is what the vet put on the paper work that the management got also they got a photo of her before moving in. Two months in to the lease they call me and say I need to bring her to the office so they can look at her.( mind you I don't have vet vision and I don't eye ball dogs and know exactly what they are to go against my vet) so I bring her up one of the women in the offices says she's a pit because of the white patch on her chest. So a week goes by I let the same women know I found a temporary home for her tell my lease is out she says fine like no big deal. Then I start getting 10 day notice 5 day notice every time I leave my house there's a new notice finally I get one from there lawyer. I'm thinking the problem was solved when I found a home for my k-9 family member witch they allowed. So the paper work from the lawyer stated I needed to get rid of my 4 lbs Pom too. Witch to me was them going above and beyond. They were no longer human beings and realized the dog they evicted was 50% there fault. Then I get a 24 hour notice the day after my grandmother passes by this time I had talked to three different people in the office. Every time I called they said I had to deal with someone else. They held my rent from the month before. Moniqe is unprofessional, inhuman, and has no idea how to make management choices that are good for everyone. She spoke to me like I was a child and expected me to be calm after being treated with such disrespect. They are sorry as human beings and I think they set it up from the begging for me to get a eviction. They treated me like crap evicted me my daughter and my dogs in 24 hours. Even there lawyer said there all over the place. I'm going to try and take them to court. Moniqe should lose her job and be forced on the streets. Repulsed."
0,Food wasn't very fresh and honestly I've had better fish n chips at cheaper places.
1,"I went to @SwitchWineBar for the @Dine4AZ #Dine4AZTweetUp. I previously went as part of the Light Rail Pub Crawl, and was not very impressed.\n\nI am now a fan. $3 Italian Drunken Sodas, $3 Caipirinhas, and a great spread of food.\n\nThey had a turkey sandwich, with fresh, handmade strawberry jam, that was so delicious, and reminded me of a Monte Cristo, but not fried. I could eat one of these every day!\n\nThe location is very convenient for light rail, and is close enough to downtown.\n\nThe beer selection was \""ok, the drunken italian soda was really nice, and sneaks up on you, but the Caipirinhas were simply fantastic.\n\nI'm thinking I may have to try their brunch, before I make a solid determination about our future together.\n\nBut I really enjoyed the TweetUp, and my impression of Switch moved up quite a bit."
0,"First time having poutine here and it was only ok.  Even for a first-timer, I noticed how the fries were soggy and cooked in old oil.  The gravy barely had flavor and it's listed as BBQ sauce when it's just chicken gravy.  Maybe it's a Quebecois thing.  $8 so not really a bargain and the plate's not even that big.\n\nThe older woman with short hair was bitchy.  Asked her about the Banquise burger to make sure it's with meat and she gave a smart reply of  \""It's a burger, of course there's meat.\""  Really?  Don't they have veggie burgers?  Besides, on the menu, it only lists vegetables under it, whereas other burgers clearly stated it's a double meat patty, blah blah blah.\n\nI don't think I'd return here.  Frite Alors was SOOOOOOOOOO much better in all areas."
0,"Bitchiest bartender in the valley!  She had such an  over the top reaction to my friend forgetting her ID you'd think she was auditioning for a soap opera. For future reference, a simple sorry we can't serve you without proof of age would be fine. And, just to clarify the situation, my friend wasn't being rude or obnoxious or trying to convince the bartender to get her a drink.  She simply realized after ordering that she had left her ID at work. The bartender went on to give a loud, extremely rude lecture on how she was not going to serve her tonight or any other night without the ID. Ummm..we weren't asking you to. So due to this unpleasant, uncomfortable experience I can't say I'm eager to come back anytime soon. Who wants to be yelled at for doing absolutely nothing?"
1,"Coming here about a week ago turned out to be a date with an unexpected but fun twist! I remember as a small naive Greek child watching corny American kids films all these eateries where the staff were in costume and provided some sort of entertainment whilst serving food at the same time....well about 17 years later this vision became reality when having seen the very very attractive offer of a three course meal  for  a mere 7.90\u00a3 (back to the 1990 prices!) I had not realized that this day of course coincided with the anniversary of the French revolution, thus meaning all staff dressed in appropriate attire complete with wigs and makeup. The 'frenchness' was further completed with an accordionist and the occasional loud and somewhat charming signing of the restaurant owner himself. \nNow to business: for a set menu I would have to say overall very impressed. It is uncommon in Edinburgh that as soon as you are seated bread olives and salad appear. The onion soup was very tasty and the skirt steak being french were just the right amount of rare.(read bloody-how appropriate for commemorating that particular anniversary.)  The chocolate mousse was the perfect ending. Our wine,at only 13\u00a3 was delicious -it was the second red on their menu.\nThe place was buzzing and justifiably so, and I am very much looking forward to my next visit."
1,"Love their plain and Almond croissants.  Triple Chocolate cake was pretty good as well.  Palmier was delicious!   I also had a Nutella brioche.  It was not as good as other pastries that I had tried, so I give them 4 stars.  But over all I love this place :)"
0,"Extremely disappointed and very angry dog owner today! I took my dog here recently for his 3rd and Final visit. My first 2 visits were great, but the last one lost my faith for good on their unprofessional and uncaring service.\n\nI have a Frenchie with a very sensitive stomach. In the multiple page application they have you fill out I mention that, as well as advised them that the cause of his stomach ailments is rawhide treats. In fact I put on his application that he is ALLERGIC to rawhides and mentioned not to give it to him because he gets bad diarrhea. So when I took him the last time, my dog apparently threw a \""temper tantrum\"" which usually means he squeals  really loud when you crate him. I advised the owner of this and she assured me they get that all the time and they can handle it. Well let me tell you how they \""handled\"" it. Yup, to quiet him up, they gave him a rawhide treat which he swallowed whole. When the handler that day told me that I was extremely upset. And rightfully so because tonight my poor guy is suffering from awful diarrhea. He is not as active and constantly having to go. \n\nWhat compounded matters more is the gal at the desk was looking over my paperwork to see where I mentioned rawhide and she couldn't find out. I advised her that the paperwork she was reading wasn't mine, and then she laughed it off when she realized her mistake and thought it read wrong because the documents described a cat's history. I was already so angry that they did not read my paperwork, but she was so unskilled to realize the difference between a cat and a dog. I had to point out her error, opposed to her not figuring out that my dog was not abandoned by a cat like the paperwork said. Ugh!!!! When I first visited I was also advised that I shouldn't worry about treats because rawhide is not one of them. Well guess what, it is. \n\nIf you take your dog here, make sure they read your documents. Go over everything with them and mention your dogs issues, otherwise you'll end up like me staying up to take care and clean up after your sick puppy."
1,"I wasn't very inclined to review this place, as I just thought it was a solid experience and didn't have much to add, but I read a 1-star review from the guy complaining about the bone marrow ravioli being like a burst of oil inside.  Listen... I know it's cool to be a foodie nowadays and be into stuff like offal and bone marrow, but if you don't actually like it, stop ordering it at restaurants.  Wthell did you expect a BONE MARROW RAVIOLI to feel like?  I wouldn't give your whiny ass a refund either.\n\nI had dinner there with my parents, and my dad's order of linguini with clams came with 6 of the clams unopened.  He finished most of the plate before I noticed, but when I brought it up with the waitress she had no problem taking that item off of our bill, because that is a real and VALID complaint.\n\nService was spotty at times, but we had a solid meal with some tasty desserts.  Also,  each of the workers (servers, bussers (sp?), the sommelier, and the manager) came by and wished me a happy birthday.  Good times.  Not really rushing back, but an enjoyable experience."
1,"My whole family was together for the first time in almost four years for my brother's college graduation, and it was a great last-night-in-town dinner. \n\nService was excellent, ambiance was great. We were greeted immediately after a short walk through the outdoor dining section and past the charming man-made duck pond, and seated immediately after. Our server, Max, had taken our drink orders and brought water and chips within a minute of our settling in. He also took pictures of the whole family together and was friendly and laughed with us. \n\nThe food was great -- the recommendations for the pollo fundito are worth listening to! That's what I had, and it was amazing. I was a little unsure about the cream cheese jalape\u00f1o sauce before it arrived, as I'm not a huge fan of jalape\u00f1os, but Max assured me it was to my tastes, and he was right! I'm desperately searching for good recipes to recreate it when I'm back home in Seattle.\n\nEveryone else at my table had pitchers of the house margaritas, which even I sampled and enjoyed, despite margaritas not being my drink of choice. I had one (well, not just ONE) of the best strawberry daquiris I've ever had.\n\nBut here's where El Encanto loses one star. My brother was unimpressed with the slightly hefty price of his pretty small burrito, even though he enjoyed it. Also, my father's beef fajitas didn't come with cheese, and only had two tortillas -- though he did get more when he asked. Not sure if there was an extra charge, but I don't think there was. \n\nToward the end of the meal, the owner or a manager (Bill), also checked on us, which I always appreciate on a busy Saturday night dinner. \n\nIn addition, Robin (one of the hostesses? A manager? She was standing at the hostess station when we walked in and chatted briefly with my mother while our waiter asked the rest of us where we wanted to sit.) gave us a HUGE free fried ice cream to celebrate my brother's graduation. It was delicious and easily enough for all five of us to share after such a huge dinner. \n\nAlso the duck pond was awesome! We sat next to the windows with a great view of the ducks, geese, and turtles! The overall atmosphere was pleasant, and the decor was charming, though noise carries inside, and as the dining room filled up, the volume went up. If you want an intimate and quiet dinner, be sure to go in before the big rush and ask to be seated away from the entrance -- outside with the duck pond understandably  attracts the families with loud children. \n\nIf I ever find myself in Cave Creek again, I would definitely eat at El Encanto again! I wish I could get Mexican food like this back home in Seattle. Guess I'll have to make it myself."
0,"In the past five years, the Las Vegas Nordstrom has declined tremendously!   The quality of merchandise is shoddy and the customer service leaves a lot to be desired.  I've always enjoyed shopping at the California Nordstrom stores and was \""thrilled\"" when they put one in at The Fashion Show.   Since the opening of the Las Vegas store, it has never been \""as good\"" as those in California, but I still enjoyed shopping there.  Now, I consider them on an equal status with Dillard's . . . .  not a bad place, but certainly NOT a high end shopping experience."

0,Please read previous posts for the complete story.\n\nI have currently handed out over 500 flyers and spoke with 43 people over the weekend 97 total people about never using this company. \n\nIf these guys new anything about business they would know it takes 4-7 positive experiences to get 1 new customer and 2-3 negative to prevent 5-7 new customers from ever trying the company.\n\nKeep up that poor customer services quike & clean\nThis time next year Scottsdale Az might have a new place to shop in place of the fraud wash.
1,"I own a BMW 7 series and have spent many years dealing with Desert BMW who's service is horrible and overpriced! My husband and I found this place by chance and have been there 3 times for service so far. I am so happy we found this company! They are honest, helpful, fast, and reasonably priced. BJ is very educated and cares about his customers this is very rare in the car business."

1,"woM is a great place for wings. Personally, I like my BBQ sauce sweeter and that is one quality I love about this place. The boneless wings are great and the crinkle cut fries are nice and crispy. They also deliver! And till pretty late which is super nice for late night cravings!"
1,My husband and I stayed here a couple of weeks ago for our honey moon and we loved it! We were on tower 2 floor 21 with a corner view of the strip and the city. The room was spacious comfortable and clean! It is a little on the pricier side but we would stay here again for a secial occasion. The only downside was that cleaning did take a while to get to our room so we simply just went to them and asked for what we needed. Other than that a great stay!

0,"Wow, my first time at this one and it'll be the last.  \n\nWent through the drive-thru and ordered my usual of trenta black tea lemonade (sweetened) and 2 birthday cake pops (don't judge!).   I should backtrack and mention that with only one car in front of me, it took 15 minutes for me to get to the pick-up window.  Unreal!  I then waited another 5 minutes for someone to come to the window.  The guy was in NO WAY the usual friendly Starbucks employee.  Handed my food out, took the money and never said a word.  Finally gave me my change and drink.\n\nI pulled away annoyed and became more so when I realized I had no straw.  Ok, I can take a lid off and be old-school.  First taste let me know they had NOT sweetened it as requested.  I thought to myself, \""Well maybe he didn't hear me.\""  I then looked at the sticker on the cup and nope...he heard alright.  *sigh*\n\nStill trying to be positive, I remembered my cake pops...yay!  Took one out of the bag and took a bite without looking (I was driving...stop judging!).  It was mushy.  YUCK!  I looked down and saw that it was clearly left out of the refrigerated case and had become almost melted.  Again, YUCK!\n\nSooooooooo, again I repeat that I will NOT be back to this location again.  Hmph."
1,"I am a fan of only a few coffee peddlers in the valley and somehow none of them rhyme with Char Ducks.    One of the things I am a big fan of in my iced coffee drinks is the crushed ice, so much colder and therefore tastier.    I don't hang out here, but I would.   The painting of Frank Sinatra mesmerizes me, if only it was for sale."
0,"I am sad to say that I'm very disappointed by this location. I love Dunkin' Donuts as I'm  from back East and think their coffee is the best, that's why I'm giving this review two stars. This store deserves less.\nThis location has very poor customer service. Not only do they not accept Dunkin Groupons, they also don't do the Dunkin punchcard, and when I went there on my birthday for my free coffee I tried to pull up the barcode they needed on my app and I couldn't find it. They couldn't tell me where  it was and refused to give me a coffee for my birthday. I found this particularly poor customer service since I am in there consistently and it was on their website that they couldn't find the info they needed.\nI've given this location so many chances because they are just down the street from my house but it just doesn't make sense to go there anymore. New management please!"
1,"First stop on my Midwest Brew Crawl with the BF! \nThe BF ate here once last year and loved it so much that we decided that we needed to make it our first stop on our road trip to Minnesota. We planned our departure time so that we could get here at lunch (it was a mere 7 hour drive!) \nWe both ordered the Bacon Cheese all beef dog (hot dog with bacon and melted cheddar on top) plus a corn dog, dusted wings and two root beers. We didn't try any of the beers on tap since we still had a lot of driving ahead of us. The Bacon Cheese was ridiculously good and I wished that I could have finished it. Unfortunately I hogged pretty much all of the corn dog since it was AMAZING!!!  The wings were also really good, maybe even among the top three chicken wings that we had the whole trip.\nI would definitely recommend this place to anyone who is in the Pittsburgh area or anyone who is crazy enough to drive 7 hours for a hot dog."

The reason for not giving more stars rest solely on the service. Our waiter was so rude and seemingly annoyed with us that it made our evening unenjoyable. I generally let things slide when it comes to dining - I am not a \""complainer\"" - but this experience resulted in me having words with the manager about our treatment. I wasn't looking for a handout or discount - I waited until after the meal to say something - but our waiter's behavior was terrible. I am generally a good tipper, but that night, all he got was 10%. \nWhile we did enjoy our food, I can pretty much guarantee that I will not be dining at Joe's again. If you are in Vegas and want a great meal with fantastic service, go to Andre's at the Monte Carlo instead."

1,"We walked into Halo (piercing shop downtown) and they handed us some pamphlets...\nOne of them was a map with all the cool/hip spots downtown and we realized we hadn't been to many of them. So we Decided to go to all of the ones listed and cross em out.\nAnd, this was our first stop. \n\nI'm gonna start off by saying how much i like the vibe of this place, especially the outside seating on a sunny day.\nThe food was so yummy.\nAnd, I normally don't like going to eat Mexican food other than my own Mom's kitchen because I am Hispanic and extremely picky.\n\nI really love their carne tacos and quesadillas..\nTheir beans(lard free) are my favorite. \nThe horchata is not that powdery crap.\nIt's home made. \nI really do love this place.\nI've been here a few times already and also brought my parents who loved the place as well.\n\nThe only thing I will say is that -if you want to get completely full, it is a bit pricey.\n\nI tend to crave this food a lot, and I'm glad I finally found a lil taco shop that met my standards.\n\n\nWay to go America!"
0,"BEWARE!! \n\nI had my car serviced here. Before leaving, the Pep Boys employee who handled my payment verbally told me that my car was in good shape and had no other recommendations for maintenance, which seemed reasonable, as it was showing no signs of problems. Following the oil change, I drove home (approximately 3 miles), where the car sat for approximately one hour. I then drove from my home approximately 7 miles where the car engine was stopped for 15-20 minutes. \n\nShortly after starting my vehicle and driving less than 2 more miles, the engine temperature gauge spiked to the maximum and the engine began chugging. I immediately turned the car off and pulled to the side of the road, in an effort to avoid any further damage to my car. Then my car was towed to a more trusted shop across town. When examining my car, the mechanics at a more trusted shop found that the radiator coolant cap was left off the fill neck and was lying on top of the engine. \n\nPhotos of the cap location were taken once the hood of the vehicle was lifted (cap was not moved by the trusted mechanic); including three images showing the coolant fill neck and the cap. The other photo showed the hood liner wet from the coolant that came out. Due to the short amount of mileage that was driven, the car thankfully became operable once radiator coolant was filled and the cap placed back on. Based on the photos and a licensed mechanic's evaluation of my car, it is apparent that the Pep Boy's mechanic removed the radiator cap from my vehicle and failed to secure it back onto the radiator fill neck. However, the store manager, Jae, informed me that since I drove my car a few miles \""it must have vibrated off after service.\"" \n\n\nI may be a female, but I know that the caps have locks, AND that I have 136K miles on this car and no cap has ever \""vibrated off\"" while driving. Thanks for the advice. Really. I sent both photos, reciepts, and letters to Jae. He was unwilling to admit any fault. Go somewhere else for work on your car. Hopefully there are other shops are more helpful and honest."
0,"I've eaten at this place but have only ordered to go. I probably have better experience ordering to go than eating in. \n\nToday my boyfriend took my family out to eat and we came here and was not impressed whatsoever.\n\n1. The lady that took care of us seemed like a bitch...my bf and his mom is thai so they spoke to her in Thai and she seemed nicer to them and to the non asian people. \n\n2. Lack of service after we got our food. \n\n3. Set up was more like an american restaurant than it is an asian restuarant. What asian restaurants gives you 3 different size of plate stacked on top of each other (american style)? What asian restaurant gives you a long table for a big group of people esp when its suppose to be an asian restuarnt where people normally share dishes. So having to pass dishes over other people while they were eating was annoying as hell.\n\n4. Asking for a pot of rice is like a no no there. They look at you funny like what?! Um, did you forget this is suppose to be an asian restaurant? \n\n5. They charge for rice and hot tea....are you FUCKING for reals? $3 for a medium pot of rice and $2 hot tea? This is so not an asian restuarant, I'm sorry.\n\nOverall food was okay, decor was traditional (more so than other americanized thai restaurants i've been to), environment and service sucked big time. This is definitely an americanized restaurant and not meant for traditional thai people or those who are expecting real GOOD thai food."
1,Haven't had a bad meal here yet. The salads are large. Large enough to share or have half and save half for later or lunch the next day. My favorite is the Thai chicken. My husband and son are addicted to the focaccia deluxe sandwich. They love the Parmesan pesto spread that have on it. I bring home a tub of the spread (sold sep) and a bag of the toasted bread for dipping when I have company. The baked goods are also excellent. All fresh and baked on premises. My favorite is the butterscotch ranger cookie. Darn. Shouldn't have told you. Now they will be out when I go!
1,"ok, so there are two aspects that i have to take into account here:\n\n1) as a store, this just isn't \""MEC\"" as i've known it. it's pretty much just clothing, and quite frankly that's the one thing that I think MEC really doesn't excel at. So i would not recommend this store for somebody who was just going for a browse of what MEC has to offer.\n\n2) that being said, i love that this store now exists, because i can order anything off the website free for pick-up at the store. so in the past, when i needed bike lights, or even just a bike tube, i'd either need to pay inflated prices at boutique stores in the city, or trek all the way out to the MEC in the boonies. \n\nso in all, i'm happy with this place, but only because i can mail any item I want off the website for pick-up, for free."
0,"I hate to put a Lindo's down since I am a HUGE fan of all the other locations. But This one.. ehhh not the same.\n\nI was excited when I found out a couple months ago that they opened a location in Henderson so everyone is the area could enjoy such awesome Mexican food, but when it was my turn to try this one out I wasn't so happy.\n\nFirst off the building use to be a Italian restaurant so it doesn't have the same feeling as the other locations. I like to feel like I'm in Mexico while eating good Mexican food, there is like no atmosphere here. Yes there are great views but it's kinda hard to enjoy when you're back to back with everyone around you. The tables are so jammed in this place I was so uncomfortable. \n\nNext up the orders were so butchered and the service was not the usual standard I am use to at the other Lindo locations. The table side guac never came, there was like no tequila in the margaritas even when we order a double, and the changes to the orders weren't there.  The server was cocky and didn't really help us out when we weren't happy.\n\nI know it was a busy Saturday night but there are some things I don't think are going to change because of the layout of the restaurant. Just not the same. I will stick to the West Flamingo and Desert Inn locations."
1,"My husband and I had our flight cancelled. The airline recommended  the Best Western, when we arrived we noticed that the RodeHouse was attached  to the hotel. We went down to get a drink and Sierra the bartender was awesome, she greeted us  like she new us. Her attitude is great. Very personable, positive , and best of all very happy. You can tell she enjoys her job. This was the person we needed to see since, we were flying from Chicago, sitting at the airport and then cancelling our flight . We were very frustrated. Thank you Sierra for making it a positive trip. The drinks she recommended  was fantastic."
1,"This is a review of the custom framing shop. I've gone here to get several high-quality prints framed and I've always been extremely impressed with the frame shop manager (Wayne) and his crew. I really cannot say enough good things about Wayne: he takes great care of all of his customers and has huge knowledge about framing and artwork. The other employees have also always been friendly and attentive, and have worked with me to make some very large custom jobs affordable. They have a huge selection of frames and matting, and there is usually some kind of sale going on that can net you big savings."
0,DO NOT lease from here. Sent me to collections before even coming to me about the issue. Received the large collections notice four months later and the day before my wedding. I sent multiple emails and never heard back from management after I moved out. BEWARE of scumbags
0,Ghetto much?  If you like to wear a ton of hair gel and buy your dresses 5 sizes too small at Charlotte Russe then SWEEEEEEET this place is perfect for you.  The ONLY good thing is the music...the crowd just ruins it though.
1,"I could not have been more satisfied with the staff! At 22 i was shocked that they would have even scheduled me for an appointment here. But they did and I had my tonsils removed everyone I came into contact with was amazing! They truly cared to make me as comfortable as possible, they truly seemed to enjoy there jobs. Everyone has off days which one nurse I believe was but it was also 6am.  But she was still nice just different.. My aftercare nurse made sure i was comfortable and not in pain. She was so helpful and truly made my experience the best it could have been. I wish I knew her name but from the pain meds and half asleep I dont have a clue! But I would recommend this hospital to any one who has to take there child here. I know when i have my children it will be the first and only place i go!"
1,Delicious BBQ! \nAnything from cole slaw to beans is so tasty. Old school picnic benches and tables for insides seating. The signs they have on the wall will remind you of a different time when gas was 19 cents a gallon. If you are coming here during the weekday for lunch come before the rush as the lines are out the door! But well worth the wait.
0,"I signed up for a 30 min massage, I was not impressed. \n\nThe upstairs has leaks in the ceiling.  Additionally, when you are in the massage area, you can hear everything that is going on downstairs--which is not even mildly relaxing. \n\nAs far as massage....I've had better at a fraction of the price."
0,We stopped in after breakfast for a latte and encountered the proprietor on the phone and trying to take our order as he was talking on the phone.  He had a look on his face as if we were inconveniencing him and we felt rushed and unwelcome.  As we were leaving we had to say thank you and good bye and as he was reading the newspaper he uttered bye with no eye contact.  The coffee was not good and we will not return here.  This establishment is geared towards the locals.
1,"My favorite meal yet in vegas:) I could have thrown a dart blindfolded at the menu and fully trusted that I would receive an interesting and delicious culinary success. \n\nThe meal is well paced and the servers are efficient (you get what you pay for). Only drawback? I was there on a Thursday and it was PACKED and very loud. \n\nAlso, free valet;)"
1,"Recently popped in for a spur-of-the-moment dinner, mostly because it's right around the corner, and happy to have the Greene House as a neighbor!\n\nLove the ambience, and open feel of the restaurant, especially with the open wall to the outside. The great weather this week obviously helped, not sure how comfy that can be in the summer, but we enjoyed the fresh air. And might I mention the people watching - if you like a lot of stretched-tight skin in various places.\n\nAlso, I always seem to like a nice restaurant with the open kitchen that seems to be part of the restaurant. All it needs is a screaming Gordon and I'd feel like I'm in Hell's Kitchen. And I mean that in a good way. I love to see the flames of the various dishes being cooked.\n\nDrinks were good, had a perfectly made dirty martini, albeit a little on the small side. For an appetizer, we ordered the warm brie. It came with perfectly toasted bread, sour cherries and garlic. Mixing all 3 onto the bread seemed like the perfect threesome. (Hey, minds out of the gutter please, I'm talking about the brie)\n\nEntrees - I had the chicken and prosciutto ravioli which were delicious, however I would have liked more prosciutto taste and less chicken. Almost had no prosciutto-y flavor. Still loved it, but I do love me some thin italian meat. (geez, will you stop with the snickering?)\n\nThe other dishes ordered at our table were the Seared Ahi Tuna which comes on a bed of stir-fry veggies that I was told was mouth watering, and the roast beef sandwich with fontina cheese. I asked my wife how it was, and all I got was a wide eyed nod as if she didn't want to even open her mouth to waste one taste.\n\nAnd my little one devoured the mac-n-cheese, penne type pasta drenched in melted cheese, topped with parmesan. (also available with grilled andouille sausage). \n\nAnd kudos to the GH for the meal size. I love a meal where you finish full, but not stuffed. Everything was the perfect size. Service was great with plenty of attention without being annoying. We didn't leave room for dessert, but the warm cinnamon and sugar donut with vanilla custard sounded very tempting. I just wanted to be able to walk out of the restaurant under my own power..."
0,"I was totally not impressed with this restaurant. The pizza tasted like it had been in the heating window for a long time before it was served....like hours. I was also not impressed with the price of the beer, $7 and $8 a pint. Not worth the trip!"
1,"I came here on a Sunday afternoon. My waiter was on point and did a great job. The food was good, but I can't say I really enjoy the decor. Overall I enjoyed my lunch and I would come back."
1,"Due diligence pays off as a continued exploration of the menu uncovers many flavors indigenous to Central Mexico that we typically don't encounter here. Most items won't have the heavy cheeses and sauces that cover up inferior dishes from other spots.  The more I eat here the more I miss the time I spent in Queretero, Mexico."
0,"Called several times sometimes they answered the phone sometimes not; never called back. finally reached their office; able to get an estimate several days later. called again with questions, no response. called them 5 times! Office apologized and said the person would call, 4 days later still no response....time to move on. worst customer service and its consistent....dont know how this company stays in business..."
0,"I love going to 20/20 for the prescription as it is always right. The rest of the experience this time was less than enjoyable. Dr. McCord was stuck on selling us the progressive lenses and he wouldn't listen to me when I brought up other options. He didn't listen to my needs nor find an alternative option to the progressives.\n\nI had a chance to think about it for a few months while I did research and spoke to people who had them and I decided I didn't want them. I went back to order my glasses and spoke with Katie at the Chandler office and I explained I wanted to order the regular lenses without any progressive lenses. She didn't understand why I would't order the progressive lenses. I explained in doing my research, I found people who would be nauseous, dizzy, and it takes about a month to adjust to them for some people. I don't have a month to adjust as I need them for work. She said she wouldn't argue any of those things but she was still pushing they would be best for me.\n\nThe glasses I wanted would be $485 for the progressive where as if I just ordered what I wanted, I would be looking at $243. Big difference! Katie would not let up. She spoke down to me and acted like I was an idiot for not wanting the progressive lenses.\n\nI decided there had to be another option, so I looked at ordering my glasses online. If you go to www.ZinniOptical.com you can find glasses starting at $6.95 for nice looking frames. All you need is your prescription and you can order them online. \n\nYou can download a photo and go through several different frames from you own home and see what they would  look like on you. I should be getting my glasses in 14 days and they were only $85 with scratch coating, UA, UVB on all glasses, free anti-glare. Great selection. My husband and I were both able to get prescription glasses for $27.99. For that price, you can get more than one pair! My husband even got the magnetic sunglass lenses for his.\n\nThe most frustrating thing is to go somewhere to purchase a product or service and running into a pushy salesman/woman  telling us what we should buy because of what they get out of it. Thanks any way Katie but we decided to take our business elsewhere."
1,"Let me just start this review with the fact that I am OBSESSED with arepas.\n\nI first tried this glorious gift to mankind in Providence, Rhode Island, of all places. It was the little mom and pop where the owners obviously just moved from Venezuela. Anyway, fast forward 3 years and I've tried to find arepas wherever I go. I've tried Caracas Arepa bar in NY and was not impressed. Closer to home, I've had Coupa Cafe in Beverly Hills, which is okay and Cafe Bolivar in Santa Monica (which is really really good). \n\nNow, for Viva Las Arepas. I saw it as I was driving to North Vegas and immediately pulled a U-turn to grab me some arepas. I ordered the pork arepa with cheese and it was really really good! Their guasacaca (green sauce) was really good. \n\nOn my last trip to Vegas I had to come back. They did a whole overhaul on this place. It looks much nicer than it used to. So I ordered the pork arepa again. This time, the sauce it came with was either the spicy sauce or some white \""cilantro\"" sauce. It was not the same guasacaca I had become accustomed to. The spicy sauce was good, but I think that the white sauce was too creamy. Bring back your old sauce!!!!\n\nOverall, it's still very good in terms of arepas. The meat is tender and well seasoned. The arepas are obviously freshly home made and they have a nice crust to them. I will have to come back on every pilgrimage to Vegas =)\n\nOther things to note: There is a parking lot and outdoor seating. Prices are pretty good. One arepa will fill you up. I've also had the fried yucca and the plantains; both are good!"
1,"After finding the Hippie Burger Joint closed at 3pm - we made our way to The Stand. We were immediately welcomed and given a brief run-down of how the restaurant prepares its food and where they get it from. When the food came about five minutes after the order, we were treated to some of the best hamburgers we've had in a long time. The house-made chocolate milkshake topped it off and it was bar none the best milkshake I have had."
0,Food was pretty good but the service was terrible. Server was unprofessional and came back after everyone had paid and asked for a better tip. I've been in the service industry for 8 years and have never ever seen such a thing. Will not be returning.
1,"As I walked in to what I thought was gonna be another cliche burger place I was pleasantly surprised at what I saw. There was old fashion burger place style integrated with a contemporary design, a very warm welcome. \n\nThe burgers look great and taste great. Their fries are better then others, you can tell by the taste. \n\nThey have a bunch of dipping sauces to choose from. They have your regular ketchup and a marshmallow sauce for those inclined. \n\nIt's a casual vibe and the staff treats you like friends. When our server brought out our food he said \"" shits boom dude\"". I'm sure his boss wouldn't like hearing that but I found it funny and comforting. \n\nGreat atmosphere. Great fries. Great burger"
1,"Big airport, lots of stores, eats and drinks. Airport isn't far from university town-Tempe, or Phoenix."
1,the food was good and had very nice presentation.\nwe had: \nmezza combo\nsteak and hummus\nfried kebbeh\nmakanek\nfalafel\nmossaka\n\nits more expensive than what i thought it would be.
0,"They have great service and fast delivery. My office orders lunch  in from them a couple times a month. Every time, I try something new from the menu, and every time, it is just mediocre. The food is just whatever. It's not super delicious, but it's not nasty ever... It just never quite satisfies the way you'd hope."
1,Wow! That's the first I thought when I bit into their sandwiches.
1,"Mr. Puss got sick last month the day I had to leave town for a week for work. Estrella got me a rush appointment within 20 minutes of my initial call, took kitty in right away and carefully performed X-rays and blood tests. They sent me home with a bag full of meds (which my lucky pet sitter got to administer) and kept me up to date on test results via the phone. Once again I found them to be caring and responsive, and I will keep going back."
0,"You should know that if you plan to take a pre-seven o'clock flight from Burbank, the plane cannot take off until 7 due to that fact that the neighborhoods surrounding the airport don't want to put up with the noise until they have to.  That means if you have a 6:40 flight, the plane will sit on the tarmac for 20 minutes before it can take off.  What?  Why not just schedule the first flight for 7:00.  Now all of those pre-seven flights are going to arrive late messing up everyone's schedules.  Does that make any sense?\n\nYou should also know that if US Air's planes are too heavy to take off or land in regards to specific airports, they will have to sit at the gate burning off excess fuel.  Again, what?  Why is US putting in so much fuel that it has to then be burned off?  Prices are already too high as it is, now we can add wasted fuel to the list of causes of higher ticket prices.  Again, passengers arrive later than expected and may miss connecting flights as a result.\n\nUS Airs response to questions about these concerns?  US Air seems to blame government regulations for late/missed flights.  Why?  How did government regulations cause an airline to load on too much fuel, or schedule planes to leave an airport at the wrong time?  \n\nUS Air along with their partner, American, do not compensate passengers for problem flights.  Disappointing first experience with US Air, which will also be my last."
0,"ANOTHER BIG TIME FAIL FROM MY YELP COMMUNITY!!\n\nCraving some serious breakfast after a long night of partying. I had already bookmarked this restaurant prior to my Las Vegas Trip based on the stellar reviews. We ventured away from the strip to this restaurant located in an industrial area inside a small strip mall don't flinch you might miss it. \n\nMy wife and I arrived at 1pm., placed our name on the wait list, Very friendly gentlemen greets us and tells us there is a 25min. wait. I says no problem. We were seated within the time frame, our waitress takes our order right away as we were starving. I usually stop at Starbucks to get a coffee when eating at most breakfast spots as the coffee tends to be weak but I overlooked my instincts lazily and decided to try theirs. Well unsurprisingly the Coffee was super weak. As soon as I added creamer it turned milky instantly. My Bad $2.50.\n\nFood/Prices- I opted for the DENVER OMELETTE with home fries and Toast Price was decent under $9. I asked the waitress if I can sub bacon for the ham that comes with the denver she said no problem.  Our order took a little while to come out. The presentation looked great big portion for sure; better than it tasted. My OMELETTE- TOTAL grease pit, they used tons of oil to cook it, plus the cheese stuffed inside was your poor quality cheese used at most LA style burger joints that increased the greasiness further. First couple bites were very mushy eggs were not cooked that well, upon further inspection I also noticed very little bacon in my omelette so I began to open it up and noticed they didnt even cook the bacon at all prior to stuffing it in my omelette. The potatoes were the only thing that came out good they were hot and crispy. I couldnt finish it even though I was starving i did enjoy the potatoes but was very dissapointed. \n\nMy wife ordered the French toast special, served with Eggs and Bacons under $9. Her eggs also cooked with tons of oil, bacon was good. The French toast that everyone raves about was weak yo. First of all it was served cold, next it had no flavor you couldnt add enough syrup to give it flavor. No moistness, no tastes of eggs or cinnamon ever touching the bread. Maybe they dipped the texas toast in milk and pan fried not sure. Was a total fail. \n\nWaitress came by asked us how our food was, I told her I was disappointed with the french toast coming out so cold. She opted to warm it up for us but by this time I was completely disillusioned with my meal. I decided to pay, leave and will not come back. \n\nPrices are Good; Portions are Big, Service Is Good, However, I prefer quality over quantity food was not on point. Sorry Yelpers this was a fail dont do it! Should have tried the breakfast spot at my hotel not worth the hassle of leaving the Strip."
0,"Stopped by this place to meet up with colleagues for a glass of wine or two.  I didn't eat here, so this review is somewhat incomplete.\n\nThe wine selection was pretty good, but I thought it was expensive.  The servers were very nice, but they were very clumsy.  In the 2 hours I was there, the bartender spilled a drink he was preparing all over the bar and almost spilled it on me.....then he dropped a dish and it broke all over the floor.  This happened with 5 people in the bar....not like he was distracted by all of the business....ha!\n\nWill I return?  Probably not....unless a friend or colleague makes me."
1,This place is great!! The guy cooking the food was hilarious! I had the filet mignon and lobster and it tasted great! I would love to come back here again!
0,"I missed this place on my last visit and figured I'd try it out last night. We were looking for some great cocktails, good music and nice vibe.  The place was pretty crowded ( which i don't mind) and the drinks were a big disappointment. As a rule, I avoid bars that attach those electronic things to measure an exact shot. The mixers were extremely artificial which made the drinks taste super sweet. \nThe D.J. was extremely loud, I guess he was mixing live but it was hard to tell because the music felt like riding in a 18 year old's car with a trunk full of subwoofers with loose windows. The Ostrich heads on the walls seem like the big attraction. I'd prefer good drinks and music."
1,The food was great. I played it safe with a chicken sandwich and onion rings but next time I'm all in on the Italian beef!
1,"Just about saved my life\n\nSo I got the norovirus and was having problems keeping anything down.  No jello or bullion or ginger ale would stay inside for more than a few minutes. \n\nDehydrated and cramping, my wife bought me a Mango Magic from Tropical Smoothie Cafe with the thought that the cold and natural juices would help.  I nursed on the smoothie for the next five hours.  It stayed down and I started to emerge from the throes of what felt like a certain painful, wasting death.  After losing about eight pounds in two days, I had two Mango Magics a day the next two days as I recovered fluids and electrolytes.\n\nKidding aside, the smoothies are tasty and don't have the artificial flavoring taste that other places do.  I'm grateful we found them and will stick with them for an occasional meal or snack."
0,"Disgusting, gross people, dirty, locals were let in first, disgusting, dirty, did I say disgusting and dirty--oh and the management was obsessed with locals--who were gross and dirty. It was just so wrong--and did I mention gross...and dirty?\nMOVE DRAI'S TO A NICER SPOT AND GET NEW MANAGEMENT.\nGROSS."
1,"Finally! We have a chipotle in the East side. I love chipotle, but this one tops many that I have been to. On all the occasions I've been here they have never been stingy with their portions. I always ask for extra hot sauce and corn and they truly do give me extra. Restaurant is always clean and workers work at a fast paste. I would definitely come back."
1,"I hate this place. I hate it because I could be checking out a different restaurant but there I am, always coming back for those freaking nachos! Ok, next time i will try and skip Margaritaville but I won't make any promises!"
1,Great Thai food! hole in the wall style location.  Very friendly staff. Let Sabi make your favorite and you will be impressed.
1,"I have known the Arran Aromatics brand & range for many years as my good friend has a house on the Island there and we visit often. The visit is not complete without a visit to the Arran Aromatics shop near Brodick. \n\nThe shop in Princes Square in Glasgow is also beautifully set up so I was pleased with this first visit to the George Street shop. It is nice to see this family business doing ok in this tough shopping climate.  It seems they are trying different techniques to get foot fall through the door.  I bought a deal on the voucher website \""living Social\"" they were doing a good deal for \u00a315 I got 3x 30ml of Eau du Toilete. This was to be collected in the shop and this allowed me to have a look at their full range.\n\nHelpful staff and nicely packaged.\nI would definitely recommend this we shop and family business."
0,I had such poor customer service with ADOT MVD. I felt totally disrespected and insulted. My order was placed and I never received it. I called in only to find out that they had shredded it because they could not confirm the address and my fee that I was charged basically became a donation to these criminals called the MVD without ever notifying me of the situation at all. Now I have to repay the fee and re-order. \n\nCouldn't be more inconvenient. I couldn't be more dissatisfied. And employees were not even nice about handling the situation whatsoever.
1,Nice clean organic oasis. Server offered any sandwich or wrap to be made vegan for me. Highly reccomend
0,"In general I prefer credit unions to banks.  I've moved all my money out of banks into credit unions.  \nThis credit union is the exception.  In short, they stole $10 from me.\nThe long story is, last year I set up a checking account for our family trust.  In the process I was forced to create 2 savings accounts with token amounts of $5 each.  I was told this was a requirement of credit unions.  What I wasn't told was that come this year and the $5 was still there, they confiscated it from both accounts because of \""lack of activity in the account\"". Even though I had nearly 6 figures in the checking account.\nI was not told this when I set this up and I feel I have been robbed!\nBEWARE OF THIS PLACE."
1,"This place was pretty bangin'.  I was visiting Pittsburgh a few weeks back and some friends and I hit this place up for a quick dinner before heading to our destination.  Bar is old and worn and just the way I like it.  We rolled in around 9pm and the place was already packed with folks ready for a rockin' show.  Nothing but smiles and good spirits.  Worked our way through to the stage and up the stairs for more space.  This joint is laid out nicely.  Bar up front, stage in the back and you can get upstairs to the loft for a view out of the fray and another bar and food.  One of the first things I noticed when I settled in were the ash trays on the tables.  Ash trays on tables?  Does this mean?  Could this mean?  YES!!!  We can smoke in this bar!  You can still smoke in certain spots in Pittsburgh.  Now, I'm not a big smoker and don't go all Lewis Black when I can't smoke but after living 5 years in a smoke-free city a little vacation to Pittsburgh just gave me a little more freedom for the weekend.  Smoke if ya got'em.  OK, back to the biznezz.  Bartender was busy but she was most efficient.  Hot damn!  They sell Bells Oberon in these here parts.  1 Oberon please!  Ordered a burger and it was most bangin'.  \nI liked everything about this place. Food, folks, fun, nice layout. This place was a good call."
0,"Service was decent, even though it was busy for lunch both times.  Food came out quickly, once ordered.\n\nFor the quality level of the food the cost was a bit high.  I believe the lunch specials were around $10.  The Salsa was decent, but the cooked food was greasy.   They do offer the option of black beans instead of refried, which is nice.  There are large portions, but quality of ingredients isn't there, and food is somewhat bland, requiring that you season with the salsa to get some flavor."
0,"The service was great especially for it being so packed. I was told they had the best happy hour, but was less than impressed. I also got the poutine, which was okay...not the best but not terrible. I didn't stay for long, but it seemed like a fun place to go with a bunch of people for expensive drinks."
0,"they advertise hand made noodles but they need to advertise it more. the place was a little dirty to be honest and caesars mgmt needs to devote more attention to this place. the decor is cool as hell but the menu and execution sucks. they have the tools to do a lot more with the place but may be relying on the decor to do all the work.\n\ni also asked for 2 desserts, one after the other was not available, and both were not available. \n\nif you go to a buffet you can probably find most of the stuff and in better quality\n\nJEANS: OK by far\nORDER: waitress"
1,Raymond was the best discount tire employee to help me in years. I have bought at least 3 sets of tires from Discount Tire over the years and no one has helped me like he did. Very helpful and friendly. Great guy and a great experience. All done in less than an hour.
0,I have never been to a store ran by a bigger bunch of assholes in my whole life. I'd feel better having abandoned hygiene for a week and going to a Ferrari dealer.
0,Worst manicurist ever. Came here to pamper myself on my birthday. I told the woman on the phone that I wanted to make sure that I got a massage with my pedicure. She said that massage was included. I signed up the deluxe pedicure and had the unfortunate luck to get Jimmy.  Both people next to me had longer times in the chair and they were there before me. He rushed through the massage and did not seem to know what he was doing. These sage I did get was rough and my  back kept hitting the back not the chair. His nails needed cutting as they cut into the bottoms if my feet. I had to wait 15 even though I had an appointment and was out witching 1/2 hour. When I complained the reduced the price by $5. Big deal. What should have been a relaxing time was annoying. My advice is to find a different salon that cares for customer  service.
1,By far the best car wash in town.  I've been using this car wash for the passed 15 years and have never had any issues... ...thanks oasis!!!  \n\nPlease bring back the punch card tho.
0,"Well, the staff are hot. And it's awesome that they were offering free mouth shots of whatever berry liquor that was. \nBut the atmosphere was really lame. I can't really describe it any better or in any further detail. It just blew.\nBut like someone else said, maybe I'm just used to the classier spots in Vegas night life. But most bars everywhere don't treat themselves like clubs..."
1,The mac and cheese Pizza was freaking amazing!  The delivery took a while but the wait was worth it.
0,"Went here for Happy Hour today.  Got seated at the bar. My friend and I were hungry and were excited about the food selection. Unfortunately the service is what ruined the entire experience. We had to wait to order. People who came after us were already getting their food. Once we ordered,  we wondered many times if they had forgotten to put our order in. There were 2 guys working the bar, no one paid attention to us. We needed more drinks, we even would have ordered dessert.  But we were in awe of how lazy these employees were.  They all seemed half asleep.  I was hoping hostess would ask me on my way out how it all went but she never asked or said goodbye."
0,"If you are looking to do grocery shopping steer clear of this place as it is an absolute rip off. The parking lot is full of Escalades and oversized SUVs whose owners don't know how to park. Therefore, parking is limited and crowd appears to be those most would consider \""entitled.\"" Some of the items they make are good, but overall the place is way way overpriced."
1,"Great second night of fine dining in Pittsburgh - chilled corn lemon basil soup, Black bass w/ a spicy creme fraiche and a finisher of a PA camembert cheese plate. Always love a smart, creative menu widely displayed on an interior wall. Will definitely be back. Oh yes, and the Big Hop East End craft beer was a great pairing for this meal."
0,"So, I must admit...I've never been to any other Mongolian grill. I know, shame on me. What kind of Yelper am I?! Even so, from what I've heard and read...this isn't the place to go for a Mongolian grill experience. I've been here a handful of times and it just seems to get worse every single time.\n\nFor the most part everyone who's been here or somewhere similar, you know how it works. But I was here this past weekend and watched 4 different tables get seated without anyone asking if they'd been there before or know what to do. Customers just stand there confused until someone comes back and for the restaurant, that's ridiculous. Sure, it's not hard to figure out but if you've never been anywhere like it, I imagine that's a frustrating experience. I hate their customer service for many other reasons so maybe my opinion is a little biased, but they definitely need to train the employees better. They don't explain anything to anyone, including the fact they you need to go get your own drink. \n\nWhen it comes to the food, it's fun being able to pick your own stuff and make your own creations but like others have mentioned, they are always out of stuff. Then when it's busy and only one line is open, the whole entire experience just goes out the window because it feels so rushed. Also, I'm not sure if it's a health reason or what...but why is all the stuff so far away from the counter? I have to bend down and reach under that tiny area to get to items in the back. It's all just very annoying to me. The food is okay but I think they overcook everything, again, maybe for health reasons? The meats themselves always seem to be dry and chewy. If you get egg, it's almost like a fried egg that someone forgot to pull off the stove. There's just nothing spectacular.\n\nI think it'll be a while before I go back. The service is crap, the food is mediocre at best and it's expensive. For 3 adults and kid to eat, it cost about $50 without the \""all you can eat\"". When it comes down to it, I just don't see this experience or food being worth that much!"
1,"Free parking?! Wish i did my research.  I walked in freezing from my walk and was immediately seated.  My server (Ben) was fabulous, he suggested two different teas out of their plethora of loose leaf- i chose his suggestion of Lemon ginger.  This actually tasted closer to lemongrass white tea so if you're not a fan- stay away from that.  I tried the breakfast bar - roti with chicken.  This take on the breakfast burrito is a great idea.  It had a rocket style salad on top to give it a little more savory. While tasty I would try it again with shrimp.  I closed my meal with Peppermint Patty Warm Up (tasty drink with Peppermint schnapps).  I will come back again and try another dish.  I'd recommend coming and go for breakfast regardless of the time of day!"
1,"Came here with my dog early in the am, very nicely done landscaping and trails.  Felt safe walking alone here, will come back again"
1,"Good food, reasonable prices and clean, almost swanky atmo. \nI had papaya salad, tofu panang and some kind of delicious coconut soup...I ordered it a 7 on the spiciness scale of 1-10, and it was perfect. \nI would definitely come here again..."
1,"I had dinner this past Sunday night at the Capital Grill.  Let me first state that I was  dining solo and was wearing a baseball hat, jeans and cowboy boots. When I entered, the hostess asked me if I preferred sitting in the bar area.  Given what I was wearing and since I was alone, that made perfect sense to me.  I sat at the bar and Richard was my waiter.  I had an absolutely different experience with Richard than was described in a recent post.  He...and the food...made my visit memorable.\n\nLet me first say that Richard had to have been one of the most professional, yet congenial, waiters/servers that I have encountered in a long time.  He had the perfect mixture of banter with me---while waiting for food--- while allowing me to have quality time with my food when it came.\n\nI do not like onions and indicated that to Richard. He then said that he was going to change some of the bread with my meal as it contained onions.  Nice touch!  A few minutes later someone from the kitchen came over and asked me if I was allergic to onions (which I am not).  I make it a habit to let servers know of my distaste for onions, when appropriate.  Never have I been asked before if I were allergic to onions.  I truly appreciate the C.G. staff for going out of their way to cater to me like they did.\n\nRichard also steered me well with food choices.  On my own, I NEVER would have thought of ordering mashed potatoes at a restaurant of the caliber of C.G.  Richard suggested that I have that as a side.  I agreed and am so glad I did.  The best word to describe them was \""sublime.\""  My main dish, salmon, was equally superb.  My only disappointment in the whole meal was that I had two beers which helped fill me up.  Alas, there was no room for dessert.\n\nAre C.G.'s price ridiculously high?  Absolutely!\n\nIs the food at C.G. ridiculously good? Absolutely!\n\nDid Richard help make my visit spectacular?  Absolutely!\n\nWill I visit C.G. again?  Absolutely."
1,"I stopped by here this past Friday night with my fiance and 2 other couples for a later dinner.  We had made reservations for 8 and whenever we walked in at 5 minutes past 8, the other two couples from our party were already seated.  The inside of this place is fairly small and I imagine that they could maybe fit 30 people inside if they tried really hard?  Whenever you first walk in there is an open kitchen on the left where they cook the food and then all of the seating is straight ahead.  Beyond that there is not much decoration that I noticed other than a couple of ledges full of empty wine bottles.  I found them to be interesting and I am sure that it plays into the fact that they are BYOB at $2 a stem.\n\nOur group decided to start off the evening by ordering the pork crostini and a meatball like dish as appetizers to share for the table .  The waiter informed us that only 4 came with the pork crostinis and so he asked would we like an order a half which we readily agreed to.  Of the two I think that I enjoyed the crostinis more as the pork had some good flavor to it.  For dinner I ordered the porcini dusted new york strip steak cooked medium which came with a Gorgonzola compound butter on top of it and a quartered zuchinni on the side.  My steak ended up being pretty lean and was cooked perfectly which gave it some good flavor.  The real star of the show was the gorgonzola compound butter though as the blue cheese really came through in the taste and yet it was very easily spreadable.  My zucchini was just ok as it was a thick piece and the while the top and bottom seemed to be cooked through the very middle was quite a bit harder.  It was seasoned well though.   My fianc\u00e9 ended up ordering the salmon for her dinner entree and really enjoyed it.\n\nThe bottom line for me is that I would head back here again in the future.  While the restaurant itself seemed small and tight I ended up enjoying my food and the atmosphere here."
0,"This restaurant replaced the Wendy's that was once here, and is currently the only option for food in the D-terminal. I ordered take out once, service was terrible, and I'm never coming back.\n\nI give it a try, so I order the Torta del Barrio to go, with fries. It's a vegetarian option for $13, including cheese stuffed peppers among other vegetables. One gentleman was in front of me, so I wait after my order.\n\nThree people order after me within 15 minutes, each ordering items on the menu of similar preparation (one even got the same dish). They were ALL SERVED BEFORE ME! I ended up waiting for 35 minutes for a meal that wasn't even that good. The fries were soggy and bland, and the bread for the torta tasted stale. No way that cost $13, I could've made that for under $5.\n\nThe restaurant didn't look that much better. The place was packed, and they pumped out a couple dishes every 10 minutes. The majority of tables were not served the entire time I was there, and they definitely ordered before I arrived.\n\nWhen you're trying to fly out, you want a quick bite to eat. The 35 minutes wait was inexcusable, especially since all those customers were served until I was dead last. The most I got out of the cashier was \""Sorry, I tried.\"" If you're going to serve food at the airport, that kind of service won't cut it.\n\nI've never said this before, but I'd have preferred fast food at the time."

1,"Freddy's burgers and fries hit the spot.  Always.  The concept and food is very similar to Steak n Shake - but I think the burgers might be better here!  \n\nIn a twist of burger irony, we tried to eat at In-N-Out burger on Easter Sunday night  around 6pm, but they were closed. So we headed for Freddy's because burgers and fries were calling our name.  The California burger has a sauce similar to thousand island dressing - which is my favorite burger.  The fries are shoestring style.  \n\nIf you don't want too many fries, then share a plate.  Each burger comes with a gazillion fries - you can easily save money by sharing one order. The kids meals also come with a gazillion fries, so skip the kids meal and just order a  solo burger and share your fries with the kiddos!  \n\nFor my 3-year old and myself, we walked out feeling very full for a mere $12.  Freddy's is a very family friendly place.  The staff is always super nice!"
0,"eh... i'm not such a huge fan of this place. in truth, the only reason i ever go here is because i'm on the guest list and this is where everyone wants to go. i really can't understand why anyone likes this place?!?! \n\nthe decor is cool, but the layout of this place is awkward to say the least. there isn't a single place in the entire club where you don't feel like you're being pushed into someone. the hallways are narrow with the whole club being really dimly lit. the dance floor is way too small and overly crowded. the music is ok, but nothing to jump up and down for. the outside smoking area is long and narrow but also really crowded. \n\n#1 reason not to go here:\nthe last time i was there i kept bumping into kevin fenderline. booooo!!"
0,Very average lunch buffet..
1,"A smooth club promoter named Emmanuel approached us in the mall and dangled free champagne before us.\n\nNow...\n\nI am a champagne lush. I don't like much else... unless it involves fruit, ice, and well...a sophisticated combination of Baileys, Guinness, and Jamison - but I am all over...yes all over - anything having to do with champagne.\n\nSo after watching the incredible Le Reve - we made our way over to Blush, with our VIP bands, to get our bubbly on.\n\nI have to admit that I didn't have high expectations for the space, so Blush exceeded any and all pre-conceived notions I had. There was plenty of room to move, good music, the bartenders and cocktail waitresses were friendly (and hot...), the space itself was glamorous and sophisticated, and as soon as we found ourselves in the picturesque and daintily lit outside patio area, some nice folks smiled at us and quickly made room on their table.\n\nIt was our first night in Las Vegas, and with our fake eyelashes batting, our brown skin hues pressed up the white chairs, and our bubbling champagne in hand - we couldn't help but bask in the sexy outdoor glow of the night. \n\nFor any girls looking for a low-key way to start the night, I couldn't recommend Blush more. Unfortunately for guys, they do charge a 30 dollar cover, which Blush, though chic and beautiful - is not worth.\n\nAlso, while you won't have to fight your way through a glazed eyed crowd, one could even remark and find fault with how mellow the crowd is/was. \n\nWhen we were there, people were evidently interested in conversing and mingling. Very few people, in fact no people were dancing, despite the quality music flowing through the lovely space. \n\nI personally loved the low-key vibe of Blush, but if you're looking for your destination Vegas night spot  full of of table top-dance moves - Blush may be too timid for your liking."
1,"I would definitely stay here again. We stayed here in July 2014, had a beautiful view of the Bellagio fountains and Eiiffel Tower, nice sized rooms and beds. We also won on craps here too, I love the fact they have 2 Starbucks plus the Miracle Mile shops here."

0,"We were there for dinner last week to celebrate our anniversary. The service was excellent! We ordered a shrimp cocktail which was really good, the fresh bread and salads were also tasty. \n\nMy husband was surprised at the tiny glass of beer you can order there but he liked it. \n\nThe issue was really with the main course. My beef wellington was basically RAW. I saw another photo of a different version on Yelp that looked perfect but mine was so under-cooked. They said they didn't want to let the pastry get burned but I don't think they pan-seared the tenderloin before it was wrapped. I mentioned I am pregnant so having well cooked meat is important. Also, there was something so horribly wrong with the sauce. It was so sour! Yucky. The veggies that came with it were under seasoned at best. \n\nMy husband ordered another steak with fried shrimp. His steak was charred on the outside. You cant really get that carbon taste out of your mouth even if the center is good. I don't know if they had a bad night with the beef or if this is what they regularly serve. At $35+ a plate, it was very disappointing.\n\nLastly, the snickers cheesecake seemed to be really tasty but it was covered in a chocolate-amaretto sauce. That was not described to us at all and when I tasted this, I knew it had alcohol in it immediately. It was yet another thing I could not eat.\n\nThe seafood seemed ok, maybe we should have stuck with that?\n\nWe wont be returning."
0,Got food poisoning from this particular Taco Bell.  : (  Will never eat Taco Bell again.  I don't care how late you're open OR how much I've had to drink...it's not worth it.   If you're looking for great Mexican food...go up the street to Fausto's or Roberto's.
1,"Not that this is the end all be all places to be and be \""scene\"" but good food, rockin' beer selection, excellent service and a decent price.  Not gonna blow your mind value, but great burgers, great service and delicious beers in a cool atmosphere.  Tempted to give it 3 stars but my server was so good gotta give it 4.  The Chipotle Ranch dressing served with the fries should be bottled and sold!  So YUM!  I will definitely eat here again."
1,"I love this place.  It's more than just a place to get your oil changed.  I've had my breaks done here as well a battery replacement.  When my car wouldn't start the other day I had it towed here.  Turns out it was just a battery problem, since it was still under warranty they replaced it without cost and even waived the diagnostic fee.  Everyone I've talked to here has been friendly, and never have I been upsold for things I didn't need."
0,"I had high hopes for the Marquee.  I hadn't had the chance to see a band there yet, tickets for My Morning Jacket were $30, not worth it for me.  But, when a friend wanted to celebrate is birthday there, I agreed to go.\n\nFirst, the parking lot has no signs to signal you in, it is hard to see because it looks like you are forced to go onto the Mill bridge but then make a right at the last second.  Parking is $5?  What?  I should have parked across the street.\n\nNow the tickets are not just the price you are quoted, they are marked up by a $3 service charge at the box office.  At the box office right in the theatre!  No ticketmaster, nothing.  Just raise the price of the ticket!\n\nNow,  they make you take everything out of your pockets and force you to be patted down.  Errr.  Then, if you want to drink they take a photo of your license for their computer.  Errr.  Was there a shooting here or something, because this is ridiculous.\n\nThe interior looks like it is meant for 4 H Fairs or Amateur Wrestling.  There is a concrete floor, poor paint, and nowhere to sit.  The drinks are way over priced ($7 a shot for Jager!!!  Robbery!).\n\nGive me $100K and I will turn this place into a venue worthy of its location and name, and make it a profitable venue.  Cheap carpet, sound baffles/curtains, high top tables, new paint in the lobby would make this a place worth seeing a show in. \n\nI will try to avoid the Marquee at all costs, its too bad there is no where else for midlevel bands to play here."
0,"This WalMart REALLY needs more cashiers, especially at night. One lane open at 10pm? That's okay if there's only a few people checking out. However, when there are 20 people in line for one register and at least three employees walk by, two of which were clearly cashiers, and there is still only one register open, there's a problem. \n\nThere have been numerous times I have wanted to buy something, but didn't have 20 minutes to wait, so I put what I could back without wasting too much time and left. I know I am not the only person that has done this. \n\nEven during the day when there are copious amounts of people, there never seems to be enough cashiers. Why not do the local economy a favor and hire more? Or does the manager get a bonus if they can get employees to do double the work for a third of the pay? \n\nThat being said, if you can get a hold of Wendy or the other managed (his name escapes me) and you have a legitimate concern, they will help you out. Wendy does a lot for the community, and it is probably corporate's fault she can't get more cashiers but... It's still a valid complaint.\n\n---\n\nIn regards to Linda P., there are many other places open after 9PM, such as Fry's and Safeway. Fry's opens back up at 4PM as well."

0,"We heard great things about this place, so we thought we'd give it a shot.  Service was slow and unfriendly.  The server treated us as if we were a bother rather than a customer.  The menu seemed to have a good variety, but when we asked questions the server looked at us like we were from outer space.  My question you ask, what comes on the burger. Food was average. We were disappointed, and left feeling  unwelcome.  Next time we grab a sandwich at Kwik Trip.  At least that way we know what we're getting on the burger."
0,I think that was just about the worst meal I ever ate.\nI ended up throwing half of it away.\nYuck
0,"Honestly we ate here last weekend because we were staying at Excalibur and it was the least busy restaurant. I kind of like the whole rocker vibe to it, but there is nothing noteworthy about the place. The novelty of the name/band affiliation does not make a restaurant.  The food was typical bbq that I could get anywhere, served cafeteria style..yawn. and as for the prices, give me a break! Even for Vegas it was overpriced and underwhelming. I had 1/2 a chicken, 2 sides and my partner had a pork chop and 2 sides which came to over $40!! I know its on the Strip but its not like this is a fancy restaurant.. \n\nAs for seeing any actual members of the band, not sure if they actually stop by but I did see Vinnie Paul the drummer for Pantera there.  That is about as rock n' roll as it gets."
1,"As a military member I love those Monday deals.  Been here several time with my wife and never had a bad meal yet.  You also get your money's worth when you order.  Currently working my way down the burritos.  The Arizona was very good, added some of the red sauce for some spice and it hit the spot as usual."
0,"this is located in what used to be a pretty happening strip mall because there was one of the only movie theaters around there.\nthen a new googaplex opened and the whole area kind of dwindled. \nwings are good, i attest to that. but... random shooting where a person dies and four others have to go to the hospital? not really my idea of good time."

1,"Go for the views, and for 2 drinks for $15 during happy hour it's definitely better than paying to go up to the observation deck. You have to get 2 of the same drink for the deal and the drinks are super sweet with not too much alcohol, but definitely a good deal because of the views"
1,Sometimes you can get a great deals than other stores!
0,No coffee maker...no room service! Ridiculous!!   They were really ill-prepared for the charllotte marthon and serving hundreds of runners. No complementary water or fruit in the lobby. Ran out of coffee and checkout for runners was noon.
0,"Dear Papago,\n\nI love you.  And I love your orange blossom beer.  The pizza is pretty fabulous too.  And I live really far away so coming here is a special treat.  But you blew it last night.\n\nThe server warned us in advance that they were understaffed and thing might be a little slow. No problem.  We ordered beer and beer bites.  I actually wanted pizza but thought it would take too long.  The beer arrived pronto.  One hour later, no beer bites and we had to leave.  The table next to us were noshing happily on their appetizer AND pizza.  I considered starting a bar fight just to steal a slice.  The waiter was super nice but I did not for one second buy his line about the beer bites taking forever.  You can cook an entire pizza more quickly than little bites of dough?  Do I look stupid?  If you lost my order, say so rather than insulting my basic knowledge of chemistry.\n\nI will probably be back but I think we need some time apart. \n\nLove,\nHungry Girl"
1,"At first glance, wasn't sure I would like the place. But I was wrong, and sometimes it is good to be wrong. Hostess was very nice. Waitress was also very nice. \n\nFood was great. The antipasta and Visuvio 12\"" pizza was awesome! \n\nAtmosphere was great. Will go back again."
1,"This place would be a hole in the wall if it wasn't for triple d advertising to the world. Love the emerald chicken and Chinese BBQ pork plus I prefer double pork or chicken fried rice.  You can get any meat in a burrito or as a quesadilla, this is awesome.  Never miss a chance to come here. Great food."
1,"Adult Slam Puppet show for 18+ was a surprisingly fun evening. I was a little apprehensive about a \""puppet show,\"" i mean i haven't seen one since i was in grade school. The evenings show was funny and full of dirty humor, and i have to say i really enjoyed the laughs. Great value too, $10 if you call and book or $12 at the door. \n\nThe venue was an architectural delight, it was an old LDS church that was built in 1929. The high round ceilings and the decorative beams and trim is beautiful. If you go to this building you should definitely take the time to look around and admire it's glory. \n\nSide note: At the adult puppet show they do offer \""adult beverages\"" to those of us that are 21 and older. So grab a beer and come laugh at the naughty puppets."
0,"What a disappointment!!! Ambiance is one thing, but when the waiter has to hand you a mini flashlight in order to read the menu it's just too darn dark.  The music was so loud that we had to lean in to hear each other. The bartender seems to think that a cosmopolitan is just a vodka cranberry served In a fancy glass. The shrimp cocktail was chewy and tasted like recently thawed frozen shrimp. While we were still chewing our first bite of shrimp, the entrees arrived....within 90 seconds of the appetizer.  That is a huge pet peeve.  It's just common sense that you don't serve the main course until the starter is completed.  Never again, Javier, never again."
0,"On the way to this restaurant, my 8-year daughter had asked what \""notorious\"" means. I explained that it means something along the lines of being famous for being bad. Little did I know, Notorious P.I.G. would definitely live up to its name. Never again.\n\nMy boyfriend, daughter and I were excited to discover a BBQ joint near our house. My daughter got the sliders and mashed potatoes with gravy. The sliders (from the kid's menu) were inedible. I almost got annoyed at my daughter for being too picky...until I took a taste for myself. The brisket slider tasted horrible; it was like chewing on burnt rubber. The pork slider was way too spicy for a child. The mashed potatoes were watery.\n\nI ordered the pulled pork with a side of mashed and Texas Toast. Okay, so first of all, if I'm going to a restaurant, I expect the Texas Toast to taste better than those from the frozen food section in the supermarket. Uh, yeah...no. The \""Texas Toast\"" from this restaurant is just regular toasted white bread with no taste. I had to put butter on it just so it would taste like something. The pulled pork was the most bland bbq pork I have ever had in my life. I left half of it on the plate, even in my hungry state. Very disappointing,\n\nOne thing that was good was the cookie sundae. They made the cookie fresh. We all shared it and thought it was great. But maybe that was because we were starving from having left behind half of our dinners. \n\nDo NOT waste your time or money on this place. It is Notoriously B.A.D."
0,Not enough personnel to support the customer. Appointments don't mean nothing here. Still got seen late and I have a guy looking at my comp and another comp at the same time. Personnel hygiene is non existent for the Apple employees.
1,"Longtime lunch customer of Ocean Blue. I started going in when they first opened and business was slow. I am always excited to see that they now have been discovered and are busy.\n\nTHE BUFFET is not what your going to find at Sweet Tomatos or a Chimese restaurant.  There is a fish and a chicken dish every day. The preperation or the suaces are different. Rice or red beans and rice along with a cold pasta sald and sometimes soup is included. For $ 7.99 its amazing. \n\nSERVICE is usually done with just one server at lunch.  Ramon does a great job and he and Sue always are friendly.  Most of the customers eat the buffet at lunch.\n\nNow the moral of the story is that this is truly authentic Jamaiican food and authentic staff.  They are friendly, laid back, and are genuinely interested that you enjoy your meal.  Give them a chance!  Relax and enjoy the great food."
0,"my cousin is from maryland and they don't really have a lot of filipino chains in her town. she wanted to eat some chow king in vegas so i took her here. we ordered a 2 piece chicken meal and they didn't give us RICE! had to go back and complain but they obliged and gave us rice. chicken was not good. jollibee is better! i, personally, think chow king is waaay overpriced. also, workers seemed rude (eye rolls and loud exasperation after our complaint of no rice). probably won't go back here since i only came because of my cousin."
0,"I know this place is new so I will give them another chance but I have been twice and had not great service.  The first time we went for dinner and received our meals before our starters and the waiter did not even realize we never received them.  He did take one off the bill which was nice.  They then charged by boyfriends card double which took about a week to get the charges reversed.  \n\nMy second visit was for lunch with a group of girlfriends and the experience was worse.  We all received our food at different times and the lost my order and one other girls order.  They did not even serve our soups at the same time, when we asked why they waitress said they were washing more bowl.  We found this very odd being that it was a weekday lunch with about 10 people in the entire place.  \n\nThe food was good.  The tuna lunch bowl was really good.  Be careful if you don't like spicy because the food is spicy.  For me thats a good thing.  I love close and I am excited about the place so I hope they get the kinks worked out.  The dumplings were Yum! \n\nHappy Eating!"
0,"Nous y sommes all\u00e9s hier soir et vraiment mis \u00e0 part les \u00e9normes drink double, le reste du repas laissait \u00e0 d\u00e9sirer. Le poulet \u00e9tait br\u00fbl\u00e9 et sec (ils disent que c'est la sp\u00e9cialit\u00e9 du chef pourtant) et le shish kebad \u00e9tait presque immangeable. C'est le deuxi\u00e8me fois que nous y allons et ce sera la derni\u00e8re. Dommage, les drink vont nous manquer."
0,"Where do I start. \nThe lady at the front end is not very friendly. \nThe whole car wash machine is so old (the employees told me) it breaks very often. So often that it broke right when I was in the middle of the drive-thru car wash machine. \nWaited 15-20min before the thing started rolling again. It never really did, I had to actually drive thru it with out having the whole soap and other chemicals applied to my tires, etc. \nI had to wait outside next to my car to be finished cause no one ever told me what to do or where to wait for my car. \nThis was my second attempt to use this place, the first one the person at the from was so rude that I didn't even tried the service. \nNo surprise here but the only ones doing their job were the people drying and finishing my car. They never stopped moving. \nStarWash is sooooo much better in all areas, even on prices.\nI would not return to this place."
0,"My family used to go there for dinner because they had decent phos and spring rolls. However, while having pho a few days ago, I found a small piece of kitchen wrap in my steak pho. I told the lady what happened and she said sorry... DAS IT. \n\nOverall not so great services and bad hygiene. I'm not going back!"
0,"So, I planned my first trip to Vegas out and wanted the best mojito in town, only to find out that e best mojito in town is also located at a little place that has the best cigars in town. Thus, I planned the excursion around dinner...so my friends and I showed up at 5pm and waited a good five minutes for the hostess to show us to our seat, only for another patron to let me know that, \""dude, just find a table, it's cool\"". The waitress out front saw us standing there and proceeded to ignore us. After find a seat and waiting for someone, anyone to at least say hi and get drinks ordered, I walked inside and to the humidor. I found a Fuente Hemingway and happened to run into a manager and let him know that I was quite bummed. He said he would take care of it and I thanked him for his time. \n\nAfter I paid for my cigar and found my seat, I waited what felt like another 10 minutes for the waitress to, at a minimum say hi and ask what we would like to drink. I even had to request an ashtray. Another 10 minutes goes by and my Hemingway Epitaph comes out along with my friends' drinks. Meanwhile, every other patron has been served, attended to, etc... \n\nAfter smoking half my cigar and finishing my first drink, I finally got the attention of my waitress, that being a standard Mojito. Which, quite frankly, could have been better. I have quite a few Cuban friends who have exiled parents who make phenomenal ones! Unfortunately, it took another 20 minutes or my second drink to come out, I even asked for the check with the second drink and had to go inside to pay!  I did get a visit from the soul patch manager who informed me very dryly that my drink was coming out - I seriously got the vibe that he felt like he was doing me a favor. \n\nAll in all, I was there and hour and a half and my experience felt a bit awkward. Many of the older patrons seemed to get priority and service and I was treated like an inconvenience. I get it, I'm 32 and look 25, but my money is the same color. I've been to a few higher end cigar bars in South Florida and was treated with respect and class. Casa Fuente will not receive my patronage in the future. \n\nSadly, I didn't even comment on the cigar, half way through my time, I just wanted to finish it and leave."
1,Really liked this place. My server was really nice and the food was great..ill be back..
0,"I ordered the fried pickles and crabbie dip to go. I rarely order fried food. I was please until I saw the amount of grease that was in the bottom of the box! OMG!\n\nI thought I would give them some feedback. Well, to my surprise, the guy who I spoke to was nonchalant and said that's what happens and there isn't anything they could do about it. WTHay! I didn't call for a refund; just feedback... Basically, he really didn't care about what I thought, so I don't care about ever going back to Bean Vegan Cuisine! As far as I am concerned, if the general attitude is that this is how they do things; take it or leave it; it's not worth me trying anything else on the menu!\n#poor_customer_experience\n#not_worth_2nd_visit\n#turned_off"
1,If you are reading the yelp for this place there is a significant chance you are drunk and coming here anyway. So what's left to say? \n\nAs difficult to find as delicious NY style pizza in the West. But you will find both and all will be golden. Best of luck on your quest!
1,"Went here for a business lunch with customers. Was seated right away, greeted within a minute and had fantastic service. This place was recommended for their seafood. We started off lunch by splitting the sampler of mini shrimp, crawfish fondue, fried alligator and calamari. The alligator was the bomb digitty. I had the fresh sushi and it was fantastic, everything has a southern creole twist on it. Lunch for 3 with appetizer was $75.00 but well worth the money. I will be back again."
1,"My mother and I went to Mastro's after I had decided on where to sign the lease for the car and apartment as I was in the midst of moving to Arizona from SF.  This place is amazing.  I ordered the Rack of Lamb, which is phenomenal.  I wish I could afford to come here!  It was a very special treat.  You can't go wrong with whatever you order here.  They serve you gigantic portions of food and all-you-can-eat breadsticks.  There was so much food, I took a good portion of it to-go and ate the leftovers for breakfast.  YUM!"
0,"Oh hell no girlfriend, uh-uh. \n\nI don't know what that drooler in the white shirt was thinking, grinding up on me like that without introduction, but I'm pretty damn sure my punch in the chest got my message across. Look-look-no-touch, thank you.\n\nThis place was, meh, average, kinda crappy music, DJ didn't play requests and kept pausing the music in all the wrong places to scream shit about Jagerbombs. Every. Five. Minutes.\n\nHad to run around the dance floor a bit trying to avoid the rather grab-assy \""gentlemen\"" that were present, and yes a wooden doll got lowered from the ceiling that vaguely resembled Frankenstein's monster. To their credit, they did play Michael Jackson's Thriller,  but then again, what else would you play to go with that?\n\nKeep walkin' people, if you've got to set the bouncer on the chavs to keep off your body (for their safety really, I would've done them more harm), you know it's not the place to be. \n\nFrankenstein, somehow that name is oddly appropriate..."
0,"They have the MOST amazing pies I've ever had.  Their breakfast was delicious and reasonably priced.  The biscuit and gravy was unbelievable!  \n\nBut, unfortunately, the service leaves little to be desired.  There were literally five empty tables on a busy Saturday morning and we were told there was a 25 minutes wait?  We were pinched for time so we ended up sitting at the bar.  It took good 10 minutes before we finally got a menu (we had to ask twice for it).  We were never once asked if we were okay and if we needed anything else.  We had to wait five minutes before finally getting our silverware after being served our breakfast.   All the staff were discourteous and impatient.  \n\nI think I'll just get pie to go next time I come here."
0,"I was a little disappointed with Omega Sports to be honest. I'm not a big fan of the large chain sporting good stores (Sports Authority, Dick's) & thought this place might be a nice change from those. But I was wrong, this is basically the same type of place, just smaller with bigger prices.\n\nThey didn't seem to have a vast selection of anything, because they try to sell everything, if that makes sense. They have footwear, college apparel, tennis rackets, fitness apparel, baseball goods, so on & so on. But by their store being limited in size, trying to sell goods for every single sport leaves you with less room to have a big selection within each category. So the items are watered down & they can't specialize in having unique items for every sport, just your basic goods. But I will say the service here seems friendly & willing to help, even though I wasn't in the buying mood.\n\nOmega Sports seems like a locally owned sporting goods store trying to directly compete with the big chain sporting good stores. I hate to say it, but they just seem like a smaller, more run down version of these stores with nothing really intriguing to entice customers away from the big chains. If you're looking for a basic sporting good item they'll probably have what you're looking for, but don't expect a vast selection of things."
1,As soon as I pulled up to this place I saw nothing but high end vehicles I thought to myself Oh no another shop to try to take advantage of me being Regular guy in Regular car Once I arrived inside was i was greeted by mike and then we went outside to assess the damage on my vehicle he seemed very knowledgeable and was very friendly his quote was very reasonable so I decided to go with him when I got my car back my car was good as new thanks Mike and thanks Exclusive Customs!!!
0,"This Sam's Club is hit or miss.  More often than not the cashiers are rude and do not understand English.  Also, they can't seem to stick to implemented policy (ie: taking large items out of the cart or leaving them in the cart). I also loathe being made to feel like a their upon exiting the store.  In no other part of the country do they check your receipts upon exiting the store.  If Costco were closer I would go there."
1,"The kids behind the counter are always nice - they always laugh and joke and offer suggestions. The restaurant is clean, brightly lit, and like the rest of the shops at Park Road Shopping Center, deep as a bowling alley. I've never been to an overall nicer Subway, in several senses of the word. The only drawback is, well, it's a Subway, and the food is not gourmet. But, hey, it's good for a quick bite and not hard on the pocketbook."
0,"I went to the Palms Casino thru Bookit.com.  My stay Oct 18-21 originally and it was for my 40th birthday.  First of all I only gave it 1 star for the actual room it self.  The room was clean, spacious with  a nice view of the strip.  The cons:   After I first initial night they came to clean our room at 6pm  I mean really...  but the second night we call them to come clean and they came right away and the third day we were there and extended our check out time  due to our flight leaving at 11pm that night, they never came at all!  We called them & asked for trash removal, towels & toilet paper & a guy that didn't speak any english or at least acted like he didn't brought towels up and kinda said someone would bring toilet paper he tired to leave but we ran & got the trash out our room & gave it to him to take with him.  Needless to say no one ever came to bring toilet paper or clean we used the kleenex in the bathroom.  At  check in I asked about the 2for1 drink specials that came with book.it.com the girl checking me in said they no longer did that and did not offer to accommodate me in any other way.    She did say we got free admission to the clubs in the hotel & we could  each bring one guest for free, yet she neglected to tell me we had to get there before 12am to get in free.  We later found that out the hard way when we all showed up to get in the club and it was after 12 am.  WHy was this a problem considering it was $15 for girls and $20 for guys and the guest we invited had to take a cab ride there & pay that fee because unlike the bull they put on their WebSITE saying they are just minutes from the strip that is DEFINITELY not TRUE it is fall as hell from the strip & anything you might possibly wanna do in vegas! We had to take a cab ride ever where & the average amount $15 on way!  if you don't take a cab you have to stand in line for like 30 minutes outside to get on their shuttle that  SMELLS LIKE URINE,  and it drops you  off at Ceaser Palace Shoppes and you have to walk like miles through the shopes to get to the actual strip which lets you out of Cesar Palace across from Harrah's.   Just a pain & not close to strip at all.  I mean you can walk to the strips it like a two mile walk and over a busy bridge I mean really who does that no one because I dint see any one doing it the entire  time I was there everyone took cabs or that smelly shuttle. Now we were suppose to get free breakfast with our purchase from bookit.com at check in I ask for the vouchers  the lady said no reason to ask for voucher you can just go and charge my room number.  she never told us what time to go or gave any details other than pointing toward the restaurant saying \""its over there\"".  Breakfast is over every day at 10 am so the first day we got there at 10:15 and they would not let us in to eat.  Second day we go eat we have pay about $15 per person because on Sundays its only a Champagne brunch and you have to pay more in order to even get in and eat even if your not drinking Why?  because they said the voucher was only worth so much in value and the breakfast that day cost more that what the supposed voucher would cover so we had to pay the difference.   OK anyway  I tell them my aunt and a friend is coming to meet us there  but they don't wanna eat can they still come on they say they can come in.  My aunt & my friend just came from breakfast at MGM Grand, & took another cab to my hotel.  My aunt grabs a crab leg off my plate and is eating it the waitress says do you want to get breakfast my aunt says oh no I am sorry we just hear talking & I didn't meant too I just ate.  We apologize and think it's over moments later the restaurant manger, Michelle Palmer, & her kitchen manager come over in the most intimidating way & demand we pay for my aunt since she ate the one crab leg I quickly pull out my credit card and without hesitation paid because the way they came to the  table for 4 ladies was threatening and embarrassing the issue didn't call for all that.  We later ask to speak to the manager and she comes back to the table with a borage of people again.  I never seen such a thing we just wanted to explain to her after we had already paid so it wasn't an issue of the money but that coming to the table the first time with someone else all rude and curt was just unprofessional and unpleasant for us and I was celebrating my birthday she didn't care at all she continued the same nasty attitude.  The manager came over again said we were too loud and the 3rd time we were escorted out by a team of security because they say my friend even though the 24 pack of beer she had was not open she couldn't have it in the restaurant. We had been there for an hour now you tell us this. The manager  could she have just asked us to remove the beer previously. I felted humiliated and targeted!  I have it all on Video and I will be down loading it to youtube! Michelle Palmer & the Plams lack customer service and honoring its promotion"
1,"Bongo is a cool wee club, residing slightly further away from the frenetic hubbub going down in the Grassmarket and Cowgate areas. I've seen quite a few gigs in here, and been to a few very random nights, one of which involved me randomly deciding to party it up on a Monday night, kind of an unusual choice for me, and brandishing a glow stick while careering round the dance floor to different rave/dance tunes. There's quite an eclectic, randomness about Bongo, which I'm keen for.\n\nThe dance floor and gig space isn't huge, but it gives the place a really friendly feel and Bongo is one of these places where you just seem to chill out a bit as soon as you arrive, and I quite often find myself bantering with a load of random people before not very long, something that I think is more difficult in other, frostier clubs and bars. I saw a brilliant gig here and squeezed my wee self to the front for a good view, but if you're of normal height and not a munchkin like me, you'd get a good view wherever, and that's what's good about seeing gigs here. The club hosts a range of alternative nights too, and is also used as a venue for performance art including theatre and dance classes."
0,"Not our first time coming here, as we stay at the cosmo each time we're in vegas, but unfortunately, the service and discernment of the staff has dropped significantly since our earliest experiences. Lets start w/ the day party - 2 stars - came through on Friday July 4th after we all landed. First the foolishness at the door with the hardcore I.D.'ing and lines to get on lines, even though we were on the guestlists and we're a group of girls. Prejudice from other staff members of our own color, were giving us a hard time and power tripping. Once upstairs the asian bartender was a total turd, we ordered gummi bear shots from her, she misheard and gave us some minty shyt that tasted like scope, she had an attitude problem when we told her it was wrong and we wanted her to change them to what we ordered, as if WE did something wrong, cause its our fault that the music was too loud and she couldn't hear us? Ok, so then she goes and tattle tales on herself to management before we go and speak to them ourselves, cause she wanted to soften her own story by telling it herself and still wanted to charge us to change the shots, cause naturally someone shot it all since they're supposed to be shots. Duh. Anyways, we finally got our correct shots after some back and forth, but it was a total buzz kill to deal with her sourness, especially when the party was already dying down. We had started our day so happy and ready to party, they completely harassed us down to were we just left. Came back again Tuesday to kill time before our flights and it was such a dead zone. Had lobster tacos, they were ok, light, small, nothing too flavorful. Both times they played awful EDM, no house at least, no switching up, no classics, just super niche electronic shyt. Marquee dayclub staff and management is super weak, and you would think they would conduct themselves better with new, hipper, sexier competitors like Drais taking the majority of their crowd.\n\nAs for the night club - 4 stars - we had a good time there last year, and a great time there again this year on a monday night after the 4th of july holiday weekend. Got through on the guestlist with no harassment this time. But also worth noting we got there really early, like 10-11ish. Was supposedly their industry night, we stayed in the boombox room with hip hop. Music and mixing was good, everyone was dancing, tons of groups of cool girls ready to have good clean dancey fun. We were some of the first to arrive, some sponsors got us tons of white gummibear shots so we were feeling nice again. Place got packed, music was great, Lebron James was in the building, things got good, cause we forced it up to be so. But originally the girl bartender was super nervous to make our normal drinks properly during the open bar because of \""cameras\"". Same with a guy tender at another bar downstairs, and he was of course more rude about it. Management needs to empower and encourage their barstaff to apply discernment independently for situations, 3 hot ladies celebrating a birthday and bachelorette, shouldnt have to negotiate for well made drinks, especially at the given pricepoints. You would get so much more money giving people proper drinks, cause then theyre feeling buzzed and enjoying themselves and want to stay longer and spend more money. Stop being so effing cheap on the liqs and making your staff so scared and bitchy, or if the struggle is so real, dont have an open bar then. And your door shouldnt be armed to the tooth by assholes. They should have the good sense to let the party girls into to party. Lighten up marquee, you're really not that hot and you're losing your audience to other hotter, better staffed and better managed spots on the strip."
0,"I've had Cafe Boa over the years and have never been too enthusiastic about their food.  Last night I gave them another chance and it really will be the last time I go back unless it is only for drinks/appetizers for happy hour.\n\nI had the seafood ravioli which consisted of five or six small raviolis filled with a mix of seafood.  They were not stuffed full of seafood, they had some seafood.  The sauce was overpoweringly salty and just didn't taste great for the $22 price.  I had initially thought that the price would mean it would be tasty and be of decent proportions.  I should have remembered my previous experiences with this place.  You do not get what you pay for here.  \n\nThe wine was decent (Malbec from Napa) and the appetizer was small and overpriced as well.\n\nNever say never, but I'm really trying to say never again to Cafe Boa."
0,"Bought 2 motherboards this morning, ram & a core processor Both mobos were bad! Their own techs could not get them to work!!! I Didn't even leave the store! Took 2 + hours and left feeling very Bad for the next guy cuz I saw them return the items to the floor for sale... After they had tested them and failed them!!!"
1,"I went here during the middle of the day this past weekend, NOT at night, so I can't comment on how it is as a club.  Upon entering we were given a tour of the place, which I recommend to anyone stopping by.  After being awed, we chilled at the outdoor area.\n\nIt was a great place to kick back and chill, and it had a nice view of the strip.  The drink menu was over the top, and one of my friends got really buzzed thanks to the bartender messing up the drink order and making an extra martini (I was surprised that they actually gave the extra drink to us).  However, be sure to watch your tab; they automatically tagged on a 20% tip to my friend's bill without him noticing.\n\nWe weren't here late at night or during any huge games, but I highly recommend it as a stop to kick back and enjoy a few drinks away from the smoke and flashing lights of Vegas.\n\nFor a few moments, at least."
0,"The worst dining experience ever. We did place our to go order on Friday night, they told us it will take less than an hour(one hour!!!!!!!!!!) to get, fine. They called after 1 hour and 20 minutes(one hour and twenty minutes, no joke!!!!!!!) and told us that our order is ready. So I went there to pick it up and the guy is telling me that there was a mistake, the order will take 1 more HOUR,  WTF?????? HE REFUND ME MONEY WITHOUT ASKING.... Bottom line it was the WORST dining experience in Madison.  EAT ELSEWHERE and stay away from this place.\n\nPS City health inspectors should check that place also, I noticed many violations down there while ordering our \""imaginary\"" food, people on the kitchen were wearing regular street cloth, some of the were wearing gloves some of them were not, so go figure..."
1,Food is good.  I like especially the kumomoto oysters.  They have four different sauces all is great!  It's a little outdated though with it's decor and Hard Rock's Hotel crowd is little loud for the clientele at Nobu.  I don't know if they are planning to stay open after they open the one in Ceacars Palace this fall of 2012.  Running into celebrities there is always fun.  Last time we saw Usher!!  Who cares if the food is just good after you sell a kidney just to eat there!  LOL
1,"I've been here a few times over the past 3 years and it's been consistently good! The wait staff is knowledeable about the menu and very happy to accommodate any special requests. \n For Appetizers I've had the Calamari which was deliciously seasoned and served with a tasty blush type of tartar sauce however I asked for a side of marinara that was gladly and promptly brought to me.  The Arancini were tasty and nicely seasoned. Crispy on the outside and soft on the inside with a good amount peas, meat sauce and mozzarella on the inside. The presentation was beautiful with basil leaves on top and served over some marinara (which was way too skimpy of an amount but they'll gladly give you more!)\nMy friend and I had the Eggplant Parmigiana and Veal Parmigiana both of which were delicious. The eggplant was breaded and fried lightly with just enough marinara and melted mozzarella on each slice. The veal was tender and well seasoned as well.  They've also got a nice wine list with  reasonable prices. I also like the way they redecorated the dining room with multicolored ceiling tile and the Trinacria. This place is always busy so I'd suggest a reservation especially if you have a larger party."
1,"Food was excellent. We had two salads they were both great. One was similar to a caeser. It was yummy! The second was the pollo salad. It had chicken, avocado, pine nuts and a lemon dressing. It was my favorite out of the two. We then had a couple pizzas. I must say that all the ingredients were so fresh. It was really good food. The reason for the four stars was our service. While the food came out timely, the server seemed like she disliked her job. She wasn't very friendly and she was often MIA. Took a while to get our check too. Lastly we got desserts and they were great too! I would definitely go back. Hopefully we have a better waitress next time."
0,"I'm originally from Detroit, so seeing this is a chain in Michigan now a few miles from my house in Arizona, I was quite psyched to eat here. \n\nYou go to the counter to order and pay for your food, then seat yourself.\n\nWe ordered a large pizza with pepperoni, mushroom and extra cheese along with two sodas. The total was $21.12. They have lots of neat old electronics decorating the inside, from old console TVs to 8-track players and even an old projector and a ViewMaster! Cool stuff!\n\nThe pizza was cut into squares. I don't know why, since this is traditionally done with a square pizza, not a round pizza. The problem is that it makes it quite messy to eat and because there are so many more slices as a result, when the person cutting the pizza doesn't press down hard enough on the pizza cutter, what you really have is a 'suggestion' of where the cuts are, requiring a knife to actually cut the crust and separate the pieces, over and over and over and over again.\n\nThe pizza would be easier to eat if if were cut traditionally, and wouldn't be as messy. But that doesn't matter if it tastes good.  However, this pizza was not bad, but it was not what I consider to be 'good,' either.\n\nThe crust, cheese and pepperoni were excellent. The sauce tasted flat, almost like something was missing. My wife thought it tasted salty. I didn't notice a salty taste, but I predict it was coming from the pepperoni.\n\nThey used fresh mushrooms, but they didn't seem to have the same flavor or texture as fresh mushrooms typically have on a pizza, but that may be because of how they cut them or how 'fresh' they actually were.\n\nI really wanted to like this place and I left disappointed. \n\nIf this was my pizza place, I would offer a 'tangy' pizza sauce, I would cut the pizza traditionally and I would offer garlic powder in addition to grated Parmesan cheese and crushed red pepper shakers they currently offer.\n\nThey brag nothing has changed since 1961 with regards to how they make their pizza. If this is how it was in 1961, I'm glad I wasn't alive back then. Sometimes change is good! Better yet, offering customers choices is even better. Would it be a big deal to offer a 'white' pizza or other types of sauces? The cost would be low and the variety would be increased ten-fold.\n\nIt has promise, but I doubt I'll be seeing any changes given how they brag they haven't ever changed, so I have no reason to go back and try them again.\n\nI have to remember not every restaurant in Michigan is great, but I was hoping this was one of them. Sadly, I was wrong.\n\nPS - Friendly staff but the location is a bit hard to find since it's buried in a crowded  multi-strip mall and only faces traffic heading one direction, so if you're coming from any of the other three possible directions, it cannot be seen from the road and there are several shopping centers on each corner, so good luck picking the right one to drive around to find it."
0,"My toes came out horrible. Lady was quick to put my shoes on and move me and when I did I messed them up. When they fixed them my toes looked bad and they left polish on my toes. Even worse when I got home I sat on my couch and the polish messed up even after I had been there for over an hour. The lady put 3 coats! My boyfriend said that it looks like my toe nails got finger painted by a blind person! 27 for a shitty pedicure. Like seriously your going to charge me just to cut my cuticles! I would't go here! I'm going back to the place off of McDowells by Fry's. Cheaper, nicer, and better job!"
0,"So I want to premise this by stating that I am not someone that goes to a restaurant trying to hate the food, especially Mexican food which has always been one of my favorites, but if your going to open a Mexican food joint in AZ you better be on point...\n\nMy sister and I went here on the advice of some friends, the restaurant was clean, the service was good, we were seated immediately,  we basically had our choice of seats because the restaurant was empty, literally empty.  They brought out the chips and salsa, this to me an important first impression for any good Mexican food restaurant, if your trying to claim that you make great Mexican your salsa better be awesome, it wasn't...they offered three different kinds, a mild with corn, black bean, and tomato, that pretty much all looked and tasted like they came out of a can, a green that was decent, and a red salsa that was really watery, the flavor was okay but the consistency was really watered down and not terribly appealing.  At least the chips were fresh, like I said at this point I'm still looking for things to like lol.\n\nI ordered the \""Farmers Burrito\"" with the adovada pork, our waitress said that anything with the pork was awesome.  It wasn't terrible (thus the two stars) it was just really bland, the pork tasted a lot like something my grandma would make in a crock pot (sorry grandma lol) but you know what I'm saying, just very bland, it had tomatoes, corn, and cheese in it also, I think it was just their \""mild salsa\"" which again kind of tasted to me like it came of a can. \n\nMy sister had the taco salad, also with the adovado pork and it was also very bland, even the dressing which was supposed to be some kind of a pablano ranch dressing just didn't have much flavor.  and tasted more like lettuce than anything else.\n\nMexican food has long been one of my favorites because it lends itself to great flavors, more than just spice, but great southwestern flavor, in my opinion La Ristra just missed the mark.  I'm surprised by the other reviews on here, and maybe they were just having an off day, but I'm not sure I'll be back to find out.  I hope they improve,  I love small businesses, and never want to see anybody fail but a Mexican Food joint in this market better be killing it, and this just didn't do it for me..."
0,"AWFUL AL'S as we call it.\nI am embarrassed they call this Mexican, especially when we border Mexico.\nHad to meet clients there recently as they selected it, I will say they are consistent.\nJW"
1,"Are you bored? Do you want to kill about 2 hours of your time looking at random stuff and end up walking out with things you weren't expecting to buy? Cost Plus World is for you! I don't remember how I heard about this place, but I remember my first time here. I spent about 2 hours just browsing. And now I'm a fan and still spend a good amount of time here during each visit. \n\nThis store has so much stuff. They have, picture frames, jewelry, furniture, food kitchen stuff and so much more! Everything is so colorful that my attention span is really short. I'll look at something and another thing will catch my eye and I'll completely forget what I was looking at in the first place. My favorite sections in the whole store are the food and the kitchenware. There are so many different snacks to choose from, like vegetable chips to chocolate covered waffles. And I love looking at the candy and spices from all around the world. It's a bit pricier, but you'll find some unique items if you look hard enough. On my last visit, I found a bunch of different flavored Kit Kat. I also love looking at all the mini kitchen stuff! Mini measuring cups, mini whisks, mini bowls...LOVE ALL THE MINIS!!! All the employees are so nice, calm and helpful. Anyway, awesome place to shop and find what you're looking for or maybe just stumble across something awesome! \n\nP.S. Don't forget to get a membership! It's free and you get coupons sent to your email!! Plus certain alcohol is cheaper for members!!!!!!"

0,"I booked my daughters first birthday here.  We were promised in the $164 we paid a month prior, 10 free tickets for day of, a entertainer for 1 hour, party favors for the kids, and a free year membership for the birthday girl.  We were supposed to be there at 3:00 for the party to be at 330.  The party before us ran over, pushing our set up time to past the party start time.  Our guests had to wait out in the mall for almost a hour.  They gave us extra time at the end, which we didn't even use. We didn't have an entertainer, the guy that was supposed to be doing it was only there for a max of 10 min. No party favors, glad I made my own. No membership at all.  Then they wanted to charge me $170+ for the 10 people who were already part of the $164 plus the additional people who came to the party but didn't actually go through the aquarium or paid already. I for sure won't be going back for another party or to visit the aquarium, which is a shame cause my daughter loves watching the fish."
0,Hygienist said that it would cost an extra $90 to clean my teeth. I left and went back to my old dentists' office at Family Dentistry (next to Fry's) and they performed the cleaning with no extra charge. The hygienist was extra pushy and refused to do the standard cleaning. \n\nAlso I was having extreme pain in my gum and the dentist could not determine what was wrong; dentist wrote me a referral to go to an oral surgeion. Again I went to Family Dentistry and they found a laceration in my gum and prescribed me the appropriate medication - dentist there said there was no need to go to an oral surgeon.\n\nI had high hopes for this dental office but they fell WAY short of expectations. I DO NOT recommend this place.
0,12.00 to Valet? Yeah right. Best to treat locals better. DownTown Grand? You are 86'ed!!! Plenty of other places to go out and hang.
0,"If my clueless 90 year old Yiddish grandma was assigned to open a rock n roll themed \""noodle\"" restaurant, I think it would be exactly like Rock'N'oodles. What is rock n roll? Here anything goes. Same with all their dishes. Anything that has a remote resemblance of the wheat meets water phenomena known as a noodle or pasta will be served here, no matter if the chef can cook it well or not. Never fucking again!"
0,"I was in need of trim a few days ago and I ran out of time to make an appointment with my usual stylist so I decided I would give Fantastic Sam's a shot. Every time I have been to a salon such as this (Great Clips, Super Cuts, Etc...) I have ended up regretting the decision so I should have learned my lesson in the past. I am sure that you can find good stylists at such salons but so far I have had no such luck. \n\nAny how I came in on a Saturday afternoon. It was busy but I was greeted upon entering. It took about ten minutes for the two stylists standing in the back to decide who was going to come check me in. I do not want to directly slam the stylist who assisted me so I will just call her \""L\"". L took me back to her chair and asked what I was looking for today. I told her that I would like a trim and that I was willing to trim up to two inches off. I also told her I would be interested in cutting straight bangs back in. She kind of laughed and told me that I wouldn't like straight bangs and that my hair looked pretty the way that it was. I knew that I would like straight bangs because I have had them in the past but usually when I stylist says something like that it is because they either do not want to do it or they don't know how to, so I decided never mind I will just have a trim. \n\nThe conversation was odd. She kept telling me that my hair was really fine and tangly (her word) and just seemed very immature throughout the whole process. The end of the session was the worst. I had requested a cut and style for $24.99. Her version of a style was blow drying my hair with a cold blow dryer and leaving my hair more than half wet out the door. I had mentioned that her blow dryer was cold and she simply told me kind of laughing that she thought the heater core had gone out (ya think?) At the end of the \""blow dry\"" I just wanted to get out of there. The trim was okay, I still see many split ends and I'm not really sure how much she actually cut off but whatever. Bottom line, I will never be back. Save your money and do your research for a good stylist who knows what they are doing."
0,The employees are so RUDE!  I can't believe with all the competition in the area that this place can give such poor customer service.  I certainly won't shop here anymore.  Get a clue Ulta.....send your employees to a customer service class.
1,"What a wonderful boutique!  I was visiting AZ over the holiday break from Chicago and my Mom and I made an appointment. I couldn't imagine going dress shopping without my Mom and liked the idea of buying a dress from my hometown as the wedding is going to be in Chicago.  Uptown was my very first stop on my dress shopping journey and I came away with the best time and a magical experience. Sheila was incredible and so helpful.  The shop is so cute and I appreciate her time and patience in finding a beautiful dress for my day.  There were so many choices in the silhouette that I was going for.  Sadly, in the end I didn't end up purchasing from the store but the dress was an extremely close second in the running.  A definite must to check out the store, it was like a dream."
0,"This one is only visited out of convenience- meaning it's a quick trip in and out (when are we here, on this side of town? when we go to my MIL's house for dinner), but I don't really like this one. I could probably blame the area as a whole- the Wal-Mart (really ghetto) and 99 Cents Store (very ghetto- in fact, I could probably say that I hate this one- actually had a verbal altercation with a foreigner, maybe Russian- have not been there since). The parking lot is way too busy making it hard to get out of your parking space if you're parked right in front of the store. Also, many of the people shopping here seem, downright weird. This store doesn't have everything you're looking for, either, seems lacking."
1,I really liked this place!  Went for happy hour and it was a great atmosphere.  Server was really friendly and checked on us a lot.  They have pretty good prices and I loved their beer selection!
1,"My husband and I love this spot! Good wine list although I wish they had some dessert wines. The manager is so helpful with helping you choose a wine, if you don't like it she will bring you wine until you do find a glass you like!\nGet the grilled cheese and the burger!"
0,"Service was non existent and they did not make me feel welcome at all here. I came during lunch because I had bought a Groupon, but they told me my Groupon does not apply to the lunch buffet (why the heck not, I do not know) so fine, I'll pay again for the lunch buffet. I have never found so many bones and hard, inedible bits in my food at any other place I've ever dined at. In one plate of food, I found 7-8 of these that I had to spit into my napkin. I told the waiter about it and he seemed totally unfazed like this happens all the time. This was NOT a pleasurable dining experience and I have since refunded my Groupon. I will not be coming back here."
1,Absolutely love this place. First time here and it's amazing. great live music great service bartenders no what's up!!!! Come on down and be Irish or cone get connected with your roots like myself irish proud
0,"Great store...in hawaii. Not here. \n\nJacked up prices (I get it, its Vegas) and minimal selection in terms of food. I was excited to see these stores, as I loved them in Hawaii, but was disappointed with the actual selection. In terms of Vegas, Walgreens is just around the corner and much more worth your time."
0,Mediocre at best. Much better AYCE in the area.
0,"Run don't walk AWAY from Dollar Rent A Car in Treasure Island! Starting with an hour wait to get service  ( with only three people in line) to them not knowing exactly which floor of the parking garage the car was on to the deceitful billing practices this company is shameful! \n\nTheir trick was to charge your for more than you had stated you wanted, then you look at a tiny screen(after waiting for an hour and on the verge of being late for a meeting) and hit agree. What we thought we were agreeing to was $150 but the billed totaled over $300 for 27 hours!\n\nWe had the same experience with the \""Free\"" GPS offer as another reviewer, which is not free at all.\n\nWe called customer service and tried to explain that we had not wanted all the add on coverage we were charged for and that we were told we would not be charged for a second day but just for three extra hours, but that was not what they billed for. They just stated that we had hit the \""I agree\"" button.\n\nWhat a horrible experience! I suppose they make their stock holder happy by robbing their customers but is that the kind of business that you want to support? Shame on you Dollar Rent A Car."
1,"The burgers here are made to order. They are huge and packed with flavors. The patty a bit over cooked though.  This is what took a star away. Other than the patty being over cooked, every layer was fresh and tasty. The garlic fries was so yummie! Must try..."
0,"Been ordering from this Ray Road Pizza Hut for 6 years,  usually $50-$70 per order for parties at our house.  Now, this franchise has started charging for red peppers and cheese packets.  Terrible decision.  After complaining to the manager and driver, found out it is the owner of this and 5 other Pizza Huts around Tempe/Chandler that has added this extra fee.  We now order from a distant pizza hut under different ownership and pay the driver a nice tip to avoid this Ray Road business.  What's next, a fee for the box?"
0,"I am giving Olive & Ivy only 1 star because the employees have no idea how to run a restaurant or deal with customers.  We went there to celebrate a Birthday which did not go too well.  First when we made the reservation we were told to come in before 3pm on a Sunday so we could order from 3 menus well when we arrived, we were told a different story about the menus and told something else by another person and the story kept changing depending on who you spoke with.  Well this restaurant should be closed between 3-5pm on weekends as the only items are flatbreads, a select few salads and apps but no one tells you this when you call.  So we had planned to order dinner but were told we could not something to do with the kitchen, but we were also told we could not order from the brunch or lunch menu either so we were stuck as to what to order, well it was terrible - the flat breads were terrible, dry and way to salty. The bacon burger was not worth $12.00 and it was just a real bad time and the manager would not comp anything for all the bad information and did not seem to care we could not find anything good to eat on the menu.  We had told the waitress we could not handle anything spicy as to let us know if we ordered something which was spicy well do not order the hummus, we were not told it had jalapenos in it even though we asked, they did not take it off the bill even though 5 of the 6 people at the table did not eat it.  We will not visit again, very bad experience, bad manager, bad customer service.  not a good fox restaurant, plus the uniforms looked like construction workers.  The food, was well not worth the money and have had much better elsewhere."
1,"Yum! Went there for breakfast on Mother's Day. The food was great, my son got the Oreo s' mores pancakes and said they were amazing. I got an egg dish and subbed my plain pancakes with the Wildberry  pancakes...also amazing! Having recently moved from Chicago I was looking for a breakfast place that even came close to my favorite, Wildberry's Cafe in Schaumburg, and this one takes the cake. They have alot of the same menu items and same taste. If you haven't been I recommend you check it out."
0,"I don't know why I keep calling this company; I guess it's because I live in Henderson and their name sounds convenient.\n\nFirst you listen to a minute-long message about how to file a disability discrimination complaint (??), and then you get to talk to a human to request a cab.\n\nThis last time, the ride starts with:\n\""How you doing today?\""\n\""Good, how are you?\""\n\n I wish I'd never asked.  For the next ten minutes I get to hear about how terrible his day is, and how that's because people are such lousy tippers.\n\nWell now I had to up my tip from a quarter to seventy-five cents.\n\nCan't wait til Uber takes over Vegas."

1,"We used our free drink coupons from our stay at Excalibur to get Melon Sours and ended up ordering a lot of drinks because their bartenders were so amazing, (see previous liquidity review) Mike was the best!  All of our drinks were made well, and it was easy to forget that you were on a walkway on the casino floor and not in some awesome dive bar somewhere.\n\nIts an awesome place to get a drink when you are tired of the crystal light they give you while gambling."
1,"The protein bars are extremely tasteful, moist and filling! Coming from someone that's tried many brands of protein bars, these are by far the best. I've tried 4 of the flavors so far and can't wait to try the rest. Allison makes sure the bars are made and sent out within 1-2 days of receiving the order and I love that I can order multiple flavors at one time.  Highly recommend trying these!"
0,"Old, dirty and disorganized!  The security lines and baggage claim areas are horribly overcrowded.  Service is slow.  Tear it down and start over!"
1,"Stop in most Saturdays while shopping. The use thigh meat for chicken katsu, which I love. \n\nService is quick and friendly. It is exactly what you'd expect from Hawaiian fast food. Food served in styrofoam, stripped but hearty and big portions."
1,"La Grande Orange is one of my favorite breakfast places. I always try to make a stop here whenver I'm in the Valley. It's in a nice, quiet neighborhood with a view of Camelback Mountain. The place always seems to be packed whenever I go, but that just shows how good it is. You order at the counter and can sit in the market, the pizzeria, or outside (be warned, seating is hard to find at peak times). There are two places to get coffee, one inside the market and one in the outdoor seating area. On top of serving good food, they have a small gourmet market that sells all sorts of things related to food. I had the daybreaker the last time I was here. It is an egg white omelet with turkey and tomato-avocado salsa on top. It is really good. It has a very fresh taste to it and it feels healthy, yet satisfying. I had bacon on the side, which was excellent. It was nice and crispy, as well as full of grease, the way bacon should be. Overall, if you're looking for a great breakfast place in Phoenix, head to LGO. I have yet to eat lunch or dinner here, but I hope I can next time I'm in Phoenix."
0,"Avoid this shop at all costs!  The food was fine, but they were totally dishonest.   We paid for our meal with a Visa, and when we checked our account, we were overcharged.  I had signed the receipt and added a tip, however the worker must have gone back and added more of a tip!  When I called to let the manager know what happened, I got nothing but attitude from her.  She told me that they don't keep any records of sales, and couldn't do anything.  Pay with CASH!"

0,"Here's a perfect example why I am hesitant about fine dining sometimes. You get great service, pretty looking food but it doesn't even taste good. So what are you coming for? The food itself or the service and food presentation? \n\nIf I had to describe the food here in one word, BLAND!\nA few more words, EXPENSIVE FOOD COURT FOOD.\n\nAnd the walk here is such a PAIN IN THE @$$ from the front entrance of Caesars.\n\nOk, the place is very nice. The service is excellent. Food presentation is wonderful but that does not mean it tastes good.\n\nThe Calamari was way overcooked. I sent it back and the chef said that's how it is. It's supposed to be dry and rubbery? I should take the cook over to Cheesecake Factory and let him try to Calamari there. I couldn't even chew it. Spat it out and they were willing to take it off our tab. Thumbs up!\n\nPrime rib was so so. I wanted to ask for some A1 sauce so you know the marinade wasn't flavorful enough.\n\nCrunchy spicy tuna roll and lobster specialty rolls were absolutely bland. No one at my table tasted a single thing. Of course, there was no way they could mess up a regular tuna roll so that was fine.\n\nSea bass was probably the best dish and when I say the best, I'm being generous. It was still so so.\n\n$6 extra for miso soup and rice to add to your entree? Ehh...\n\n$160 including tip for 4 people. Never again. Social House @ TI is a bit more expensive but at least the food tastes MUCH better."
0,"My family went to this Outback for Sunday lunch.  We usually go to the Sahara location but they do not open until 3pm.  Anyway, when we were seated we were not given a kid's menu.  No big deal by itself but then:\n\n1) 10 minutes before being greeted by \""I will be right back\"" by the server\n\n2) Server told us kids cannot order steaks any way but well done.  We told her that could not be true, we order the same thing for the kids every time, so she accepted our order for a medium steak for our daughter.\n  \n3) 5-10 minutes later, and we still do not have our drinks, we are told by a different person that children absolutely must have steaks cooked only well done.  We are offered no explanation.  We finally just left and went somewhere else.\n\nWell done meat has more dangers than eating meat rare in the longterm.  There is no real explanation for this if the kitchen is using proper sanitary practice so either they are admitting they are not or the Outback employees are just so lazy they wanted us to leave so they would not have to work as hard."
1,Love this place! I had a Ruben and my husband had the signature roasted turkey and stuffing sandwich. Food was EXCELLENT ! ! Mac and cheese was nice and hot and the orzo salad was seasoned perfectly. Only reason that my rating is not 5 stars is because of the clunking noise coming from the beverage cooler. Very annoying. Don't pass this place up if you're in the area. Will definitely be heading back soon!
0,"My sister an I visited recently. We couldn't win anything on slots, they were sp tight. After losing a good amount of money, we decided to give bingo a try.  What a ripoff.  We each spent over $50 for our buy in, and never came close. This place seats like 100 people. Never again! I will stick to playing at the Fort where I can win when the place is at capacity,  and spend less than $50."
1,"Love the EpiCenter! I always have a blast here. Blackfinn, Suite, and Bubble are some of my favorite places. Looking to avoid paying cover and the crazy crowds? Well Take your boring cheap ass up to Aloft WXYZ lounge and enjoy the stunning view of the city. I will say parking sucks, however.... across the street at \""whatever-something\"" tavern it's $5."
1,"Good choice if you are looking for a pricier Italian menu. They feature veal entrees and a pretty good assortment of Italian seafood dishes. Their homemade gnocchi and cavatelli are wonderful as well. The service is typically so-so, but the great food keeps me coming back."
0,"I've been a couple of times now and although i'm not throwing in the towel on this place yet, i'm not sold either.  the first night I went I was not that hungry so my opinions may be prejudiced a little. I had the sausage and beans as an appetizer to start.  the beans were very good but the sausage left a lot to be desired.  it lacked seasoning and juiciness.  I prefer a spicier sausage and perhaps one that is either cooked to order or has a higher fat content.  we also shared the chicken sandwich Inot my choice).  it was a heavily breaded boneless breast stuffed in a big loaf of bread.  it felt like a bowling ball in the stomach after eating half of it.  the second trip I tried the pizza.  we went with the house special.  a thick square pizza with hand cut pepperoni. it was good but I had huge expectations.  it was a little salty and a little under-cooked.  on some level it reminded me of BJ's thick crust pizza but that's a little too harsh a criticism.  i'll try it one more time before my final verdict.  service was good both visits and the beer is cold.\n\nok, followed up after a long absence.  no more.  spent over $20 for a 12 inch pepperoni pizza.  it's too salty, the cheese isn't a great quality, the tomatoes are completely forgettable and the crust is indistinguishable from many other thick crust pizzas."
0,"CPK is one of my favorite restaurants and this location was by far the worst one I visited. First of all, the waitress never offered me any bread. No biggie. I ordered a soup, starter salad, and a pasta. The baked potato soup was so thick, it actually tasted pretty bad; the starter salad was a disappointment because the greens were kind of dried out, and the pasta (chicken tequila) sauce was watery. Overall, it was a pretty bad meal."
0,Was vacationing in Vegas over the weekend.  Found this station and can't get enough.  I stream it here.  Chicago radio blows.  Just a really good alternative playlist.\n\nUPDATE 11/20/11:  THEY CHANGED FORMAT!!!  I NO LONGER STREAM IT IN CHICAGO.  YUCK.
1,"We have been very pleased overall with Capri Cleaners, friendly staff, cleaned clothes (just occasionally they put a little more starch than we request) and great pricing.\nHighly recommend!"
1,"I suppose there are both pros and cons in having a pretty solid Mexican restaurant right up the road from your home. The obvious pro being the accessibility to great food and drink (generally Dos Equis or Modelo for me), followed swiftly by the obvious con of un-doing your exercise routine for the day. \n\nBut in any case, I generally enjoyed this restaurant with the exception of cost. In the grand scheme of things, it isn't necessarily pricey. It is generally comparable to other Mexican restaurants. For me, if I'm looking for a quick, around-the-corner Mexican restaurant- this is definitely the place to be. If I'm looking to penny-pinch, I'd drive a few minutes down WT Harris towards the university and hit up Zapatas (my absolute fan favorite). \n\nI generally liked every other aspect of this establishment. The atmosphere and d\u00e9cor were set perfectly for a Mexican restaurant. Good ambiance. The food was well prepared and was pretty delectable. Beer was flowing. The service was spot on. What more can you ask for really? \n\nThere were specials here, which most looked appealing. \n\nDefinitely worth a try!"
1,They have the generic sushis which I like. I am always a fan of those restaurants that have inari. I believe it's one of my favorites even though it's just rice and tofu. The sweetness of the tofu is just so satisfying !
1,"Old-school neighborhood bars have a special spot in my heart. Especially a neighborhood bar that actually has decent beer on tap (ie, anything else besides the run of the mill Miller Products or other equally as terrible/generic beer). Couple that with heart-attack inducing bar burgers and you're golden. I stopped in one night with a friend of mine who lives divey-neighborhood bars as much as I do and he was equally as pleased. There is something magical about dark Wisconsin bars with good people watching qualities. \n\nGood beer. Good burgers. Good neighborhood. Good people."
0,You feel like your in downtown Detroit when you come here nowadays. It used to be classy place with good martini drinks. Now its a trashy place that serves watered down ones..
0,"sorry to say I did not have a good experience at L'atelier.\n\nWe were a group so we had a set meal to choose from, which was HEAVILY laden with meat. I don't have anything against meat but when each course (except for desert) is meat centered and every option is meat centered its a bit much. There was no way to choose around this. \n\nI had to settle for instead of 4 courses to get 3, with a overdressed salad, but still paid the same price as people who were getting 4 courses of meat. \n\nThe food in general was not outstanding for the price you pay.\n\nThe waiter was not very friendly either. seemed more interested in hanging out with his friends who were at the restaurant as well."
0,"I have used this location many times for various reasons with almost always friendly competent help. Today I went in to have some factory rims put back on my car. I had paid for it once before so they offered to do it free of charge, GREAT! When I picked up the car it looked odd, upon closer inspection they had mounted the rear rim on the front left and front on the rear while also mounting the wrong tire on the wrong wheel. When I pointed this out the manager Art muttered \""that's why we didn't charge you\"" nice. Adding insult to injury when they corrected the issue they managed to keep my factory metal valve stem caps. Not a big deal but a major annoyance to my OCD. I will still use them in the future but this was definitely a hiccup in their customer service."
1,This review is about my second experience at Tottie's. Our waitress was super nice and cute. She was also helpful and when she didn't know the answer to a question we had she went and found out the answer very quickly and didn't try to just make up some nonsensical answer to appease us which I appreciated.\n\nI had the Pad Kra Pao with beef with level 7 Thai hot which is the top level of crazy there (no biggie). The basil on top was all in a big bunch that I had to off the leaves myself which I didn't love having to do but I think was part of their presentation with a big cabbage leaf underneath as well so it was not a huge deal. I enjoyed my meal much and liked the heat. It was a good mix of veggies and I especially like the red peppers and bamboo shoots in there. The waitress didn't check on us till near the end of the meal and I generally like them to see how we like everything a few minutes after we get our food so that's where the service surfaced. She was willing to bring all the Tice we wanted to with our food free of charge and gave a bunch more extra rice in the boxed up food she gave to the people I came with who did not finish their meals. \n\nOverall really good meal and I'll most likely be back sometime relatively soon.
1,"For starters, the bar was awesome.  Very chic with great service and equally tasty drinks.  The snacks are very appropriate to get your palate ready.\n\nThen there was dinner with awesome music.  Rock during dinner was quite unique and not too loud as others have boasted.  The bread selection was divine and don't miss out on the Bavarian Pretzels - to die for.  Appies:  Steak Tartare, Butter Lettuce Avocado Salad and Big Eye Tuna (there were more I just lost consciousness after those).\n\nMeat - most of us had the American Waygu.  Amazing meat and cooked to perfection.  The sauces we ordered were a very nice addition to the meat.  Might want to just order a few as the flavors tend to get lost in the party.\n\nLastly, we had just about every dessert.  The Fuji Apple and the Strawberry shortcake were my favorites.  Hats off to the Chocolate Souffle as well - cooked to order and was spot on.  The service by our waiter along with Marino could not be matched.  I have dined at all of the Puck properties and this rates in the top 3 - maybe top 2.  Bring your wallet or expense account because perfection does have a pricetag.  If you are going to eat a fine meat meal once a year - this is the place regardless of the price."
0,"Overrated. Guys, don't wear tanks to this buffet cause they won't let you in they'll make you buy a $12 shirt unless you are staying at the wynn and can go to your room to change. Food was not that great and service was even worse.  The lady that was supposed to serve us got our drinks once and never came back to check for refills we had to get other waiters to get us more drinks.  We wanted to try this buffet going off the ratings and reviews on here and also spent more at this buffet than any other but were very disappointed with it. Studio B at M Resort and Wicked Spoon at Cosmo way way way better food and service."
0,"Upon walking into this particular Subway it didn't look very clean. Food on floors and tables not wiped down. I stood in line for 5 minutes and watched the workers gawking at me in an uncomfortable way, while whispering to each other. I walked right out and went next door to Senior Taco. Never going to that disgusting Subway again."
1,"I was pleased to find out about Fry Bread House East.  Not long ago I ventured to the original Fry Bread House in Phoenix and loved the food.  When I returned to Yelp to write it up I saw they had the East location in Mesa.  Happy to have great fry bread at a location that is more convenient for me.\n\nThey offer the same menu as the original restaurant.  Again I had the red chili beef Indian taco and, again, it was delicious.  At first glance the menu may appear pricey but the portions will leave you satisfied and stuffed.  Fry bread makes for a great taco base.  My only complaint is no free refills on the beverage and the cup is filled liberally with ice but, eh, I won't hold that against them.  The smaller mom and pop places need to find ways to make money and I'm sure this is a great saver for them.\n\nOn my next visit I have every intention of trying the desert style fry bread with the powdered sugar or chocolate sauce.\n\nIf you're in the east valley and looking to try something different, this is a place you need to check out."
1,"We live in Plaza Midwood, and we can get food delivered from there.  The person who took our order and the delivery driver were both very attentive and courteous.  \n\nThe food was really great - hot (temperature), perfectly cooked, well seasoned, and yummy.    The portions were large, which means a lot of leftovers.  We will definitely order from them again."
1,"Good portions, especially compared to the same type of establishment you'd find in NYC. On the pricey side, service was a bit slow on a Saturday night, but overall very romantic. Scallops with foie gras are highly recommended. Bring a flashlight for reading the menus, and of course your appetite."
0,"Payard is pretty good, but it doesn't live up to the hype nor the prices.  Granted, I only ate at the take-away counter rather than eat in, but if you're going to have a take-away counter its pastries and food should be just as good as that in the restaurant.\n\nWe had an overcooked almond croissant (amandines are my favorite), a good plain croissant, a mediocre ham and cheese quiche, and a very good croque monsieur (ham and cheese, essentially).  So it's hit and miss.  The coffee was so watery that we returned it to the surly server, who at least gave us more recently-brewed coffee that was still slightly watery.  \n\nDifficult to find in the labyrinth of Caeser's Palace, maybe Payard is worth the trouble and money if you sit inside.  But as is, it's an okay French place with just above reasonable prices.  There are other places to go in this town."
0,"Unfortunately, not a great experience. We still had to wait forever for a seat, then waited forever for our food. I ordered the same thing as I did before, bagel with lox. It was gross. Nothing was fresh. My red onion was translucent, like it had been frozen and defrosted. The whole thing was just unappetizing. Bummer. At least last time the service and the food made up for the wait. Not so much this time :/"
0,"Now that I have come clean to the Yelp community about my occasional dabbles with chains I feel it is best to cut right to the quintessential original chain.\n\nI myself very seldom get anything from McDonald's but I have kids that enjoy their french fries and the wraps they affectionately call \""Crap Snacks\""\n\nAdditionally my wife is not a coffee drinker and her preferred caffeine delivery method is diet coke.  So the fast food joints not infrequently get the business for the diet cokes.\n\nThe reason this particular McDonald's bears yelping is that it holds a singular record, one that I am at this point hoping it will maintain.  Once a record is set I sometimes loathe to see it fall.\n\nYou see, this particular McDonald's has been visited by myself or members of my immediate family not less than 12 times.  On not one of those occasions have they produced a mistake free order.  Not once.  It's really rather remarkable.  It's not like we routinely order dramatic variations such as \""No ketchup\"" or the dreaded \""Can you put Big Mac onions on that?\""\n\nYet they have steadfastly achieved at least one mistake on each and every order, without exception.  \n\nOn the occasions when we visit this McDonald's we now wait with baited breath while someone checks the bag and confirms that yes, indeed there is something we did not order in the bag or we are missing something we did order or something we ordered is not right.  Please, in the name of all that is Mass Consumerism in America, do not get this order correct!  We have standards!  There are bigger issues at play here!"
1,"$35 dinner buffet with crab legs and bone marrow?  I was sold.\n\nI came, I saw, I conquered the buffet.\n\nAll the items tasted were pretty good.  The crab legs were standard, some pieces were a bit salty but i guess that's how they get you. Salty+water = full. NOT ME!  Power through.\n\nThe shrimp cocktail are pretty large and fresh.  They put them in little shot cups so that you eat less. NOT ME! The prime rib is pretty tender and juicy.  I asked for the rare cuts in the middle.  Delicious. The burrata salad was a big hit at my table.  \n\nThe bone marrow was pretty straight forward.  Cut up bone with .... (get ready for it)......marrow inside.  Good if you like buttery stuff, you can also slab it all over bread, if you plan on wasting space in your stomach.  \n\nThe hot items are all prepared pretty well.  Good potato gratin, risotto, sushi (spicy tuna), tender mussells and clam dishes.  The desserts are pretty good and the gelato bar is always appreciated at the end.  Wish they had a bit more seafood, but I'm not complainin!"
1,"I love visiting this Starbucks location! :) It's one of my favorites to visit. The team is always super friendly, personable and always makes my orders correctly. When our office has placed large orders, they always have things organized and get our orders ready quickly. They go the extra step to help me carry all the drinks out to my car and I so appreciate them. :) Best Starbucks team in the east valley!"
1,"If you are looking for good ole' southern eats, look no further. Seriously. Stop. This is the real deal.\n\nI have been lucky enough to eat at John Mull's throughout the years. My most recent was when we had them cater for our company lunch. Best decision we had made in a very long time.\n\nThey set up in our parking lot and you could just smell the good food cooking away.\nWe had ribs, chicken, brisket, sausage, mac & cheese, baked beans, potato salad, macaroni salad, peach cobbler, rolls and assorted BBQ sauces.\n\nThe mac & cheese is simply some of the best I have ever had. It was cheesy but not greasy. It was ooey and gooey and the perfect balance of flavors.\n\nThe baked beans! HOLY MOLY! I am not a big baked bean person but these beans were delicious. They were mixed with ground beef and a concoction of seasonings that just kept me wanting more. \n\nOut of the meats, the spareribs were my favorite. They were tender and just delicious. The brisket was good too - juicy and smokey. The chicken was actually pretty good too. Not dry at all. The sausages, well who doesn't like a good old sausage.\n\nThere is never a reason to pass up on something this good. I promise. Good food, Great portions, Reasonable prices."
1,"My friend wanted to take me to breakfast and when she mentioned the place I was thrilled to try it out, being from out of town and judging by the reviews it was worth the try.\n\nThe interior was beautiful. I absolutely loved the decor, it was simple and clean. Even the bathroom was designed well. You order your food first and then seat yourself at a table. Beware of large brunch crowds. \n\nThe food alone was wonderful. The meals were perfection and prepared with the slightest simple yet effective touch. What really drew me to the place was the flight of cold brew, what a genius idea!! We ordered a mexican benedict and a BOMC. The benedict was exactly what I expected, its presentation was great and the chorizo definitely gave off it's mexican flavor. The BOMC was spectacular. The portion is enough for two and easily one of my favorite dishes, even though I haven't tried anything else.....it was just that good. The pork chop was tender and wasn't too seasoned so the pork flavor alone was enlightening. The waffle was a perfect sweetness and my eggs were as good as scrambled eggs can be. The portuguese donut it was paired with was cute, light and powdered with sugar. I didn't have much of it because I was already extremely full from the dish, which was bittersweet. I had a iced latte with vanilla and it was great, smooth and sweet. We also had the flight which will get you to that coffee high. I can't remember the names of the brews but the jalape\u00f1o one was interesting, though wouldn't be my first choice.\n\nI would recommend the restaurant to any breakfast or coffee aficionado. If I'm ever in the area again I would love to stop by. I hope to try some of their other establishments if ever the opportunity arose."
1,"I went to a number of Knights games through the years in SC but attending games there was a wee bit \""ho-hum.\"" \n\nApril 2014 - what a change! This is a beautiful field. I am really impressed with the new BB&T Ballpark. There is something for everyone here, lots of beverage and food options - just a fine night out in Charlotte. Go for date night, bring your family or just come on your own. And oh, about Charlotte - you can't beat the beautiful view of uptown."
0,"I like the Aldo chain of shoe stores because it is a pretty nice mixture of decent fashion, decent quality leather shoes, at decent prices. \n\nFor men, it's like Clarks or Bass with more style, or Kenneth Cole without the designer price.  \n\nThe two stars is for the staff/service. I didn't like the whiney voice of the person who helped us, she seemed off in her timing and attentiveness, should I say robotic sounding?\n\nHey, I helped earn my way through college selling shoes, and later was a junior buyer at a regional department store chain early in my career, so I know a little something about shoes. \n\nThe girl that helped us didn't. \n\nWe didn't buy anything, but I professionally reboxed and stacked up the pairs of shoes for them to easily put away. That includes putting back all the tissue, cardboard, plastic, etc. that comes inside the box of every pair. \n\nThe staff didn't seem to care less. Unprofessional. \n\nJust call me an old Shoe Dog.\n\nBut a better breed than Al Bundy, the loser Horn Dog."

All of those nights where my heels ate my feet alive... all of those days where the walk to Fashion Show Mall seemed like trekking to Egypt and back...\n\n.. you ALWAYS find these awesome treasures at the end of your trip. But I'm here to tell you if you are headed north on the strip, taking this little beaut is worth it! Warm, quick, and easy (much like many other things in vegas) the tram will get you there in a flash (hey-ooo).\n\nWe lucked out and didn't have to wait, but we were in Vegas over a holiday weekend and I never saw a line, however, stranger things have happened. \n\nRide it.

1,"My stylist was very knowledgeable. Yay, 13$/haircut!  She even knew about my natural curls & told me how that would work w/haircuts I wanted. Thanks!"
0,"I got a group on for this place because it was recommended to me by a friend even though the reviews were not great. I should have listened to the reviews. When I made the appointment, the lady said they would call me ahead of time to discuss what the theme of my shoot would be. They called less than 24 hrs ahead of time to remind me of the appointment and left  a brief message. The makeup is basic, heavy and ages you. No wonder they need to touch up the photos. The backgrounds are dirty and some are particularly ugly. When I mentioned to the photographer that I didn't like one and I'd much prefer another he told me to trust him. Well I was right I hated all the pictures with the background I didn't like and the poses I told him I didn't like. Then I did decide to get three photos. It is expensive.  The next week my friend went and got 4 poses for the same amount of money.  Maybe the longer you are there trying to decide the better deal they give you. I don't know.  Then they told me my photos would be ready in a few weeks. I waited and waited and finally called and they said they were not in yet and to just be patient.  Meanwhile they do barely any touchups and I'm not even getting prints. They just have to put them on a disc for me.  Also, it took me four times to call in because they never answered the phone and the voicemail box is full. Overall, very disappointed. I wish I had my money back."
1,"Given the location and the history of this place, you may have really low expectations.  That helps, but the food is actually quite good.  Friday night's ubiquitous fish fry, of course, but they have a respectable menu of Mediterranean specialties as well.  I'm fond of the Shwarma Platter, myself.  Some nights they have belly dancers for entertainment- that's really fun to watch.  \n\nWhat's a trip to a hookah lounge without an actual hookah?  Try the peach/mango, it's amazingly smooth and flavorful.  I'd never tried it before and was amazed at how uncigarette-like it is."
0,"Horrible service. Had a ton of staff but never got what I wanted. Never got my daughters drink, no refills and even asked for crayons on several occasions only to be ignored. Food is nothing special. Overrated. Not happy with our waitress."
0,"First time going here. Pull up to the attendant, he shakes his head at me complains that my car is covered in bugs (of course it is I just got back from a roadtrip - thats why I took it here) and gave me bad attitude. He charged me an extra 3 bucks for bug removal, Ive never heard of that before... Not a big deal, wait for my car to get washed, everything looked fine, except a letter from my car tag is missing that definitely wasn't missing before. I waited thirty extra min for them to fish it out of the gutters and all the manager does it stick it back on my car with tape... What a joke. I threw a fit, and he didnt offer me anything or even apologize and was a major a-hole. He told me to stop bothering him. You couldnt pay me to go back here.\n\nUpdate: You can ignore the response from management on here, I contacted him and got no response."
1,"You want New York pizza? Go to New York. You want the best New York pizza in Arizona? Go to Venezia's. Yes this family run shop was featured in Breaking Bad, and they have shops in AZ and NM. This pizza is better than any other pizza place that claims to have New York pizza. Trust me, I'm a New Yorker."
1,"Best Mexican restaurant I've been to!!! This place is way better then your typical Mexican restaurant.  They need help with the service though. Service was slow and very \""hairy\"" feeling, maybe they were understaffed. Other then that great spot."
0,Went on a Monday for lunch and it was not crowded at all. They also had a wide variety of pizza.\n\nI got the pepperoni and mushroom and it was not good at all. A little on the salty side for my taste. Sure the portion was pretty big but does that even matter if you're not going to finish it?\n\nMeh. Blah. And meh again.
1,"Took over entire place for the Greenbuild Conference this week. Jeff (owner) is awesome. Great breakfast delivered in a basket (hot quiche, hot muffins, fresh coffee, OJ, fruit). Totally affordable (we put three guys in each room and it cost us less than $90 per night per guy).  Rooms are casita style and pretty dark and beat up but served our needs."
1,I've lived in this area for so long and finally I went. This is the best Mexican food I ever had and they are nice and polite. The carne asada was high quality. The prices were just right . it's just good. The beans had cheese in them and were great.
0,First walking in I was hesitate . It looks really dirty and in poor condition . The service was horrible . We were seated and took about 20 minutes for someone to come and take our order . People who came in after us had their order taken before us. When we arrived there was about five tables that still had dirty plates on them . When we left they were still there. They had probably been like that for an hour . The food was good but the sides are portioned very poorly . I really don't recommend this place. Go someone where else . The Service sucks!!!!!
1,"Islands isn't just a restaurant...it's a lifestyle.  You can get anything here, from burgers and fries to soups and salads.  Great service and great food; who doesn't like that?  Islands is perfect for kids and adults!"
0,"Low quality food, I've had salads and their burgers, while not being terrible, it's not good.  Typical strip prices (relatively high) and quality comparable to a cheap grocery store deli."
1,"2 words \"" Oreo Overload\"""
0,Awful. tenders were fast food level. Burger was diner chain level. little to no flavor and the server recommended both to us. yuck. atmosphere was not fully there. all the stuff going on seemed lazily done and sort of in poor taste. If you're gonna be risque then make sure you go big with it..
0,Not a very good brunch today....the eggs Benedict got overcooked while sitting out on the counter. No one had bothered to take our drinks order until we flagged one of the servers down.\n\nOverall food experience: I've had better days with them!
0,"Not the worst by far from the best. If your name has the main dish in it you better stand out from everyone else including Mc Donald's pushing the same thing, especially if you're gonna overcharge. \nNot consistent enough for me to go back a fourth time.\nSorry guys find some other sucker to pay your rent.\nIf my fellow yelpers must go here to get ur poutin fix keep it simple, and whatever you do stay away from the braised beef!!!\nI don't know what that animal was, but it wasn't no cow!"
0,"Just like other reviewers, I also felt  that this place was small and dirty.  Bathroom wasn't clean.  It seemed like only regulars were getting good service, all the others were left with attitude and bad service.  Bunch of gym rats and meat heads are regulars here to look at the waitresses and flirt with them. I would advise against taking your family there.  Not a neighborhood family type of a place.  food was ok...too pricey for the service that they provide.  ."
0,"Went to have all you can eat sushi with Teri, Reggie, and her friend. Although the all you can eat sushi's are popping up everywhere in the southwest, it is in an area that is just beginning to develop so I don't know if that's why they didn't have business. Kinda weird because it was a weekend! There were only a couple other people in the restaurant. I think most locals have their all you can eat faves like Sushimon :). \n\nThe nigiri was ok, fish was cut thin and small pieces, but rice sucked. When the rolls remind me of something you can buy at a grocery store, it's a bad sign. They had alot of the crab mixture filling them up. One roll we got was covered in mayo and sauce which made it better. The cucumber salad had a dressing straight from the bottle and the tofu was not the way I was used to from other restaurants. \n\nFor being empty the service sucked. At other all you can eat, the waitresses are usually right there ready to take more orders. Also this waitress did not seem like she got her sushi training because she was having a really hard time answering questions etc. \n\nI admit I am a tad bit of a sushi snob, but I would not recommend this restaurant unless you have very low expectations for sushi! hehe"
0,"I'm currently staying there. The hotel doesn't have public microwaves. You have to pay $10 to rent one. They currently have  0 microwaves available to rent. I'm stuck with food that I can't eat. At the Hyatt, they have public microwave (a friend of mine is staying there currently). I recommend staying at the Hyatt... Much better than Sheraton. I never heard hotels not having microwaves..."
0,"Honestly? I'm just done with this Grimaldi's. The service absolutely SUCKS and last night's effort was definitely a perfect example of what's wrong with this location.\n\nWe had a 1 hour wait last evening, which was excessive given there were tables that were empty waiting to be filled for quite some time. Secondly, we ordered 2 salads but only received 1 of them. We waited so long for the other, the pizza came out first so we cancelled the other salad. No apology. No offer of making it up to us...nothing. There were at least 1/2 a dozen times when a server or a guest broke a dish or glass while we were there. It was almost to the point where people should have started shouting OPAH! afterwards! At one point during our meal, a child raised a plate over his head, smashed a plate to the floor (to which the parents did NOTHING--but that's another story) right in front of the server. The plate broke in a thousand pieces, several of which hit us in the legs. It took at least 15 minutes before someone came and swept up the remnants of the broken plate. That is unacceptable but......Did the manager come over? Heck no. He didn't even MOVE or turn around from his seat at the bar where he was parked watching the Spurs/Heat game. That's right. The manager parked his butt in a seat at the bar the entire time. He would randomly get up and go cut a pizza from time to time, without washing his hands first mind you, but he never came around to a single table, never looked up once during the parade of broken dishes, and could not have been any less involved in his shift. The pizza took so long to arrive that it was actually cold and the crust was soggy. \n\nDone. There's just no reason for this when Grimaldi's isn't a cheap visit at all. I've given too many chances and it's just not worth it."
0,"I don't even know where to start. I ordered the house fried rice and was told it would be here \""soon\"", after waiting more than an hour I decide to go outside my office to see if maybe the delivery driver got lost. Sure enough, there he was stating \""here's your food\"", passing it to me, then promptly leaving. I looked down at the tiny box he had handed me and wondered what my $12 had actually gotten me. Not much. I had about 2 pieces of shrimp, a ton of egg and something that looked like pork (even though it's advertised to only include shrimp,  beef ribs, and chicken). It was tasteless, room temperature and really greasy. I tried adding soy sauce for flavor but that did not help. About halfway through my 3rd bite I began to feel sick and decided to save myself the trip to the emergency room--I threw this \""food\"" away. Will not be eating here again."
1,Haven't ate here in years due to location but decided to have hubby pick this up for dinner last night.\n\nMu shu pork- amazing!\n\ncrab Rangoon's- Amazing\n\nChix and broccoli- pretty good broccoli a little mushy\n\nReally enjoyed dinner! check it out for some good eats
1,"For a chain I really like this place. \n\nThe atmosphere is very casual, and the food is consistently delicious. This is a great place to go with a large group as they have so many little rooms. The portions are huge so order with care... Location is perfect -- great place to dine before hitting the old town Scottsdale scene later.\n\nBar area is decent with a reasonable crowd around happy hour."
1,"I love a good sandwich place, and this one is definitely worth a visit! I went here on the high recommendations of Yelp and I'm glad I did.\n\nFreshest ingredients, excellent flavor and not just your ordinary sub/sandwhich place. I had their home made roast beef and was very impressed! By the way, if you need to feed a small camp of refugees, get the large... It's a monster!\n\nI highly recommend it to anyone that likes a good sandwich."
1,"Came across this place on a whim, but glad I stopped in. Defiantly has some unique burgers on the menu. I went with a pork and beef burger with Chinese sausage on a Taro bun. Also had some mushrooms on it. Good flavor and the taro bun actually had taro flavor to it! Bad part of the meal would be that the fries did not come with the burger, everything is ala cart.  I liked the sauce that came with the fries. Would recommend anyone to come here that's going to Vegas."
0,If this is what Mr Keller puts his name on he needs to maybe eat here one time. I would rather go to Red Robin than go back here. A medium rare burger that was brown all the way through and sweet potato fries that had sat under a light for who knows how long. 100% tourist trap Oh and the service Sucks too......
1,Local favorite. Wife and I been coming here for years. Breakfast special is my fav!
0,"Why do craft stores always smell like cinnamon? \n\nMaybe there's some scientific study the Michaels people commissioned where they found that the \""Scent of Christmas\"" causes otherwise sane people to spend obscene amounts of money on those rubber stamps and scrapbooking scissors. I don't know but it freaks me out.\n\nIt also makes me sorta hungry. But what it doesn't do is make me want to buy anything. \n\nAnd the woman in a cat hair-covered black velour tracksuit blocking the yarn aisle ain't helping things either."
1,"This was my first time here and my server Jacob was amazing. I asked about the dishes and he walked me through them along with telling me about the different spice levels of their sauces. I would definitely recommend this as a place to go for great food, drinks and service!"
1,The food was excellent and they were able to substitute some things and make me a special dish that was not on the menu. I had the king crab which was steamed and sprinkled with some olive oil and lemon.\n\nThe wine list was very extensive and the staff was able to help us pick the perfect bottle of wine. The service was great as well. The only reason that I did not give this restaurant 5 stars is because of the ambiance. It was quite quiet and a little dead. If you are looking for an intimate dinner then this is for you! I was expecting something a little bit more lively but overall it was a great restaurant. The prices were also very reasonable for the quality of food and service. We will definitely dine here again on our next trip to Vegas.
1,"Always amazing, great food friendly atmosphere! Feels like your at a good friends houses for dinner. Cash only and no alcohol but no cork charge if you bring your own bottle."
1,"We visited Bobby Q for the first time this week. The food and service was great. We ordered the ribs, chicken and brisket. The ribs were fall-off-the-bone delicious. The chicken was moist and flavorful. The brisket was tender and cooked perfectly. Our waiter was very attentive. We will definitely go back!"
1,Ribs are special. Dry or wet. And the smoked and BBQ chicken is great. All the sides are good and the selection of sauces is great. Try the corn muffins. Bet you can't eat just one. Would be a great dessert but it comes with the meal platters. Worth ordering an extra meal to take home. Very friendly staff. Large facility so usually get seated quickly.
1,Jay at Kick Ass Kakes is a cake genius and deserves a 5-star review. We had a destination wedding at the Sanctuary Camelback Resort and he created a couture cake that was truly a work of art. He really takes pride in his craft and most importantly loves what he does. \n\nHis masterpiece-du-jour was a 4-layer vanilla cake covered in delicious buttercream with alternating filling of berry frosting and tart preserves. It was decorated with the most stunning cascade of handmade edible flowers!\u00a0Guests were huddled around the cake table all night long!\n\nThe best part of his sugary-bliss creation? It tasted AH-MAZING!
0,"What a joke! Service is way too long for 1:00am (not pm) and basically empty. Still it took more than 15 minutes to bring out breakfast food. I got up and left, disgusted! Overpriced...$8 for a breakfast bagel! You must be kidding. I will go to Starbucks instead and pay 1/'2 that for the same plus coffee."
1,Calicos is the spot to be at Westgate. The night life here is awesome. The ladies are everywhere. I definitely recommend trying this place out. You'll probably run into me here. Good drink specials and celebrity guests. Can't go wrong heading to Calicos.
0,"Quality of food has decreased rapidly: constant change of management. Not responsive to constructive suggestions as simple as food not cooked, food has no taste etc."
0,"MUCH BETTER IN VEGAS THAN THIS PLACE!  Don't waste your money, my wife and I have been to many other great restaurants in Vegas and this certainly is not one!  First of, the location sucks as it is next to the buffet in the convention center part of the property.  Second, the entertainment is average at best and that is if you get seated in the only area of the place that could actually see most of it.  BEWARE - the other thing they don't advertise is that the entertainment is not FREE!  You would think it would be part of the obscene food/drink prices but NO, you get hit with a charge for Live Entertainment..probably mandated but they should let you know these things..Finally, the service was terrible..had to continually wait for them to fill our wine glasses, took 15 minutes to get the check and then approx another 15 minutes to get it finalized!\n\nThe only decent part of the place was the food and decor.  Again, it was \""decent\"" at best!  They push the caviar flatbread...we could hardly tell if there was caviar on it or not...just one big egg spread over top of everything else..."
1,"This place is great!  It's not at all how I envisioned it looking and I'm glad about that - the interior is really cool (great bar) and there is a nice patio as well.  The service was great and the food exceeded my expectations.  \n\nI got the roasted beet salad with goat cheese and these spanish almonds that I need to order online somehow, and the salmon with a panzanella salad (this was the special for the day) and both were delicious.  I tried the chicken and broccolini pizza which was really good, but will try the spicy rock shrimp one next time.  \n\nMy favorite thing was the chicken meatballs - doesn't sound really appealing but they're in an al forno sauce (tomato sauce and herbs - tons of flavor) and I hoovered at least 4 of them.  It's great if you have kids, but also want a dinner that is a bit more refined than the average pizza joint.  I thought it was very reasonably priced for the quality of food we ate as well."
1,"As an Oregonian, I'm a HUGE fan of our Portland International Airport. However, I can say that Vegas' peeps have a pretty nice airport. \n\nWhat I like about McCarran:\n\n* It's a huge airport\n\n* Slot machines!\n\n* Cute shops.\n\n* Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf!\n\nWhat I don't like about McCarran:\n\nThe garbage claim..I meant the baggage claim area is a bit depressing. I think either is the lighting or just the atmosphere made it look like an interrogation room area."
1,Fantastic juicy burger cooked to perfection. Order a beer and it is served in the coldest goblet you've ever seen. Can't wait to go back again. Staff is friendly and helpful.
1,"Second visit just a wonderful as the first!  We lucked out on Friday night and were seated within a few minutes.  Score #1!  Our server skillfully navigated us through the menu.  We started with the Yellowtail Sashimi and the White Fish Special.  I cannot do justice to the freshness and quality of the sashimi - superb!  Next was the Hydro Bibb Black Cod -the crispy cod was delicious! The BF had two of the tostadas - one shrimp with mango and one salmon with pico de gallo - both of which were devoured with joy!  While he worked on the crispy tuna roll, I was having a Harry Met Sally moment with my Salmon Belly - OMG!  Creamy, buttery bliss!  As I was trying to make my moment last, the BF was having his own with the Vanilla Cream Brulee ( I am jello) made with vanilla beans! Everyone is so warm and genuine!  I love Soho!!!!!"
1,Amazing!!!!! Fantastic food and great service!! Love it here and will come back next time I'm visiting!
1,Great food even better service!
0,"Horses and dogs defecate here constantly and there's virtually no enforcement of policies to prevent this from getting worse (at least with the dogs).  Often there's drunken people here on Sundays, and they're not exactly \""from the area\"".  They then meander up the trail to the smallest hill in their street casual clothes, laughing, and not watching their wandering kids.\n\nWeekends are horrible here because everyone finds the need to say hi to every single person they see going the other direction on the path.  It gets old, people.  So, avoid weekends if possible.\n\nTrails were much better before they made so-called \""improvements\"" in the way of widenening the paths.  Now there's an oversupply of overzealous mountain bikers who don't know that pedestrians have right of way, and are so lacking in dexterity that they can't seem to slow the bike without skidding down the hills.\n\nDuring prime weather months it is common to have a local pastor sing religious songs on top of the lowest mountain, with a guitar.  I'm not sure if I'm more bothered by the fact that he does this, or by the fact that other people are not bothered by this as much as I am."
0,"Bathroom broken. Almost nothing for condiments for hot dogs, only relish and packaged mustard and a few jalapenos. No onions, no sauerkraut, nothing. No cheese for nachos, not enough jalapenos for the nachos. Cheese machine was empty. \n\nAbout the only thing these days this store is good for is stuff that comes off the truck...but they have slot machines and energy drinks! If you need to use the bathroom, or are hungry, go somewhere else."
0,"Too bad I have to give them one star and cannot give them zero stars. I don't know how their food and drinks are, but their service is HORRIBLE. Eight empty patio tables on a weekday afternoon, and the hostess told me there is a 15 minute wait - would I like to put my name down on the list. The inside of the restaurant was not full - it was half empty. This is the most ridiculous restaurant I have ever encountered. If I owned the place I would fire every single person working there today for being complacent to this inane seating policy. Serve the customers you have - not the ones you need to text to remind them of their reservation."
0,"In the world of cakes, there's somehow an unspoken rule that if it's pretty, it's okay to be subpar in taste and moistness. In my world, this does not compute. It needs to be as tasty as it is pretty. Period.\n\nSo I can only give kudos to the artfulness of a Tammie Coe Cake, but nothing more. Cakes where you are told to remove the fondant and then eat it... that's not right--you should be able to eat it all--and yummily so. If you like the taste of fondant... you've got to be kidding me--Yucky!\n\nSo take my review or leave it. I just think a cake needs to be tasty and moist first and pretty second... less of course it's for a wedding, than it needs to be both EQUALLY. Who has ever said no to an ugly but great tasting cake? Not me. So I'm putting my foot down and saying I won't eat a cake or cupcake that isn't tasty to me.\n\nNow, I must state that I am more a fan of cake than frosting. Frosting is secondary to me. So if you are more for frosting than for cake, ignore my note and have at all the Tammie Coe's and Sprinkles of the world--and have mine... no really, go ahead.\n\nIf there IS frosting--for me and others like me, a little bit of frosting goes a long way with one exception: If it's Whipped Cream Frosting... then BRING IT ON! I like frosting's more subtler relative so if it's a Whipped Cream Iced cake, I won't make it a point to get an inside piece, or scrape off the icing at all as I would a basic frosted cake.\n\nAnyway, Tammie Coe's cakes or cupcakes don't do it for me. If I have to partake in one of her treats, I'd shoot for her pastries or cookies before cake or cupcake.\n\nAs for MJ Bread, I have no complaints there... their breads really impressed. I can't remember which CenPho restaurant I had my first taste of MJ bread, but I remember being V E R Y impressed."
1,"I like the fact that they have two drive thru windows, so there is almost never a big line. Up the street from where I live. Huge variety of coffees, I have only gotten the Snowy Mocha, Caramel Hazelnut and Mexi Mocha. Not a big fan of Mexi Mocha. But the other two are great. Coffee is a little pricey, although they are a little bit cheaper than Starbucks. I would say I am a fan, great place to grab coffee, lots of choices and the people who work there are friendly and seem like they love their job. That always goes a long way, considering I am in the F&B industry as well."
1,"Pros: walking distance from the crib. One of the few places you can get Rogue's Hazelnut Brown Nectar. And in 24 oz big-boy bottles, too. w00t! Unparalleled beer selection. Barstaff that is just this side of surly. Local art that is (usually) pretty good.\n\nCons: Umm, not open for breakfast? Can't really think of any.\n\nNow go drink some beer."
0,"I mean, I guess it's sort of a Madison Institution, right?\n\nBrats are basic, no-frills, and mediocre at best. You're much better going to another place that serves quality, local cuisine. Cheese curds are on par with Culver's...which is saying something (and not a good something, I might add). Fries are curly and pretty tasty.\n\nBeer is pretty pricey for a Madison dive. \n\nService is always excellent, bartenders nice. Cool outdoor patio. Food quality and prices makes this a 2 star joint, but it's important to note the service--which is, as said before, always great."
0,"We were disappointed overall.\nTo start, we had made reservations a week prior, not really knowing what time would be best since we were from out of town. We called earlier in the day to see if our reservation could be changed to an hour later and they told us they could but there would be an extra 45min wait on top of that. We scrambled and made it to our original time. \nThroughout the night we found it odd that there were many empty tables in the restaurant yet they couldn't move us to a later reservation w/out an extra 45mins wait...\nThe service started out great, we ordered a few drinks before we put in our food order. They were served in a fair amount of time, we were not in a hurry or it could have been considered slow bar service. \nThe server was very friendly, which was the only reason they got 2 stars instead of 1.\nWe had a 4 course meal which they managed to screw up. They forgot to bring us one of our appetizers. Ok, mistakes happen, we let it go. \nMain course came out and it tasted good, fresh. But we waited an eternity for desert. From when we finished our main platter it took about 20 mins for desert to be brought out. There was a table next to us that had the same problem, they waited even a bit longer from what we noticed.\nWith so many places in Vegas that are top notch, go elsewhere so you will not be disappointed."
1,"When I lived in Charlotte, this was one of my standard bars, especially on nice summer days and nights.  \n\nInside is a nice bar, a couple pool tables and plenty of seating.  Additionally, they have an extensive outdoor area with two more bars, tables and benches for sitting and ping pong tables for fun drinking activity.  There is also a front side patio for outdoor seating in a more lax atmosphere.\n\nThe food is also pretty good.  The crowd is from all walks of life which adds to the intrigue of this bar.\n\nDo yourself a favor and visit this bar, you won't be let down!"
1,Great experience. The staff provided exceptional customer service. Michelle especially was very attentive to our needs as she worked with friends planning to relocate.
1,"Support your local small business. This is an independent pharmacy on the Southwest side of town. They will value your business and treat you with care and compassion. Give them a shot and you won't be disappointed. They accept most insurance. Really fast, friendly service. I get all my prescriptions filled there now."
0,"Horrible!!! My wife ordered the filet, and I the Aged Bone-In New York. Both tasted like they were seared in a pan of oil, with no salt and pepper. I have been to many steakhouses, and this had to be the worse. When we complained to the waiter, he asked if we wanted steak sauce? Told him that we should'nt have to put  steak sauce on a $60.00 dollar steak. Go to Prime at the Bellagio. Go anywhere but here!!"
0,The first time I experienced this buffet was in 2009... and probably then I would have given it 3-4 stars.. but now.. something happened.. and it's not as yummy..\n\nI felt like the quality of the place has kind of gone downhill from my previous experience.\n\nThe foods were typical buffet foods.. the desserts were typical buffet desserts... nothing that really makes it stand out.. nothing that really tastes great enough for me to keep coming back..\n\nAt least it was clean..
0,"It was our first time there. The service was great at first and then it got worse as the night went on. Our drinks and appetizer came out pretty quickly but we had to wait at least 45 mins for our entrees to be served. We should had said something when the people at the table next to us sat down and got their food before we did. When our food finally arrived it was lukewarm. We ate a few bites and took it home to heat it up. We told the server about it and she didnt say much about it and just said she was sorry.  The sad part about it ! It was our 33rd Anniversary.  The food was tasty but cold. I might give it another try, maybe happy hour would be good. Very Disappointed!"
0,"I'd been hearing about DNA since it opened, and was excited when I finally had an opportunity to experience it for myself.\n\nThe ambiance is very original - the lounge area is decked out in orange, and the dining area is a split-level, very open air room. Lots of glass, and the designer light fixtures are out of this world.\n\nThe menu is focused and divided into three courses - an appetizer, and pasta dish, and a main. There were three of us, so we were able to sample a number of dishes. Although nothing was bad, absolutely nothing impressed us. And for the prices, we expected to be at least somewhat impressed.\n\nSame went for the service - one of our orders was mistaken, and I felt as though we were consistently chasing a waitress.\n\nIt's too bad because DNAs use of fresh, local ingredients, and their initiative to use the entire animal is awesome, I only wish it had been better executed."
1,Rita's reminds me of my visits to New York and New Jersey. I love frozen custard. This location has been around for some time but I barely discovered them about a month ago! Now I don't have to wait til I visit Jersey or New York again to have Rita's. The staff is very friendly and informative. They will let you try flavors until you are sure of your choice! Also ordered a pretzel at my last visit with my ice and I was very pleased. I believe they are even open late til 10pm or so. I will update this review when I confirm their hours.
0,"I'm sure the food would be better if they had more professional employees. I used to be a regular, now I hardly step in. The best times were when Mike and Sherman ran the bar. Mike is one of the most professional, upbeat, positive employees that ever worked there. Recently things changed and the old miserable bartenders were back in place of Mike. I'm sorry but Ofelia is a bitter old miserable person and she is extremely rude and she is slow. Omar has no personality and is boring. Now I've been coming here a long time on a regular basis but over the last couple of months this place has deteriorated, the quality of the food is not what it used to be and more over just the public display of unprofessionalism of the staff. I witnessed two female employees argue and call each other a b*tch in the dining area. The employees openly talk bad about each other in front of customers. I was in the bar once and Ofelia referred to Sherman in a derogatory racial slur as he walked away from the bar area. I've never witnessed such unethical business practices in a dining establishment.  The majority of your staff is extremely unprofessional. Your restaurant wouldn't survive a day in the real corporate world with the level of unethical behavior that occurs there. I stopped by today and I asked to sit on my regular section with Mike, I was told by your hostess that Mike no longer worked there that he was fired. Not only should that information be confidential from a human resources perspective but the smile on your hostess face sealed my decision to not come to your establishment again. I turned around and left. I have hosted numerous business functions there and now I will be hosting them at other places. I think your staff needs a complete overhaul starting with your management. A business is only as good as the management hired to run it and I'm sorry to say you suck at it."
0,"I bought my tickets through groupon for $14 each. Good deal! My family & I were going on a Sunday. I googled the waterpark to find out the hours. It said it opens at 10. As I was checking the website for what I can bring into the park i noticed it said 11. Then I checked the yelp reviews and yelp said they open at 10. I wanted to be there when it opened so I could get a shade area in the grass. At this point I was thoroughly confused so I decided to call and listen to the message. The message seemed to be updated since they posted the date and time their summer weekend hours started, which was 10. So we got there at 9:45. The parking lot was empty so I went to the front to see if hours were posted. On a chalkboard it said they are open at 11. As I was walking back to the parking lot someone who was operating a leaf blower told me it opens at 10. I explained that the sign said they open at 11 but he assured me they open at 10. I don't think he works for the company so I disregarded what he said. When I saw someone in a golf cart I asked him. He was wearing a big surf shirt so I knew he would have accurate information. He told me it opens at 11. I told him that I checked the phone message and that it said they open at 10. He shrugged his shoulders at me and said, \""well, we open at 11.\""  He absolutely didn't care about the inconvenience that I had experienced even after I explained it to him. He was actually very rude to me then drove away in his golf cart. The general manager, Bob, is in serious need of customer service training. He does not care about the customer, customer satisfaction or his job. \n\nBesides that, as soon as I entered the park I noticed that the trash cans were already completely full. It looked as though things were not cleaned up from the day before. The bathrooms were just disgusting. It was out of toilet paper but there was soap and paper towels. Each time I used the restroom I never once saw people wash their hands. They just walked out, which doesn't have anything to do with Big Surf but it just added to the feeling that this is a dirty place. My boyfriend told me that the men's bathroom was out of paper towels all day. No one went to clean or check on them for the entire day. The park looks like they need to do some major renovations. \n\nThe lines are not as busy as other water parks, so that's a plus. But there is also a reason why I suppose. I won't be back."
0,UNBELIEVABLY RUDE SERVICE. If you want to be ignored completely for simple things such as water please eat here. If you want to call to ask a question and the person that answers yells at you please call here. Enough said. Can take my love of pho else where.
1,"I don't understand why this place has only 3 stars. \nYes it's not 5 stars place, but it's very southwestern restaurant in old Cave Creek, with appropriate  menu.\nWe tasted multiply items and yes I will not comeback there for BBQ, but like chicken fried steak and even liver and onions, \nBut fried chicken it's die for , I can't imagine it's can be done more moist, and that alone make this place 5 stars for me"
0,"Not the place to go if you are looking for service...?? Or happy hour..\nSamantha was no joy tonight, almost felt like she was not on the same planet.  Maybe she was having a bad day.??? Maybe she just doesn't have a desire to be in the hospitality industry, I don't know but I expect more from the staff tending the bar and I won't be back to this location because of the \""service\"" I got tonight...."
0,"The barista ignored me for 3 minutes, then finally turned to me and said, \""ya\"". I ordered a 4 shot macchiato and explained how I wanted it and I ended up with a latte. Also ordered a chocolate chip scone and got a chocolate chip cookie, after I had to tell her 3 times."
0,"My family of four went in for breakfast. This is a very small but cute establishment. There was only one open table that was able to seat six and they wouldn't seat us. The hostess wanted to leave the table open \""just in case a larger party came in\"", rather than seating the customers they already had. They wanted us to wait at the front for a smaller table to open up. Once we convinced her to let us have the table the hostess was extremely rude and told us with a really sarcastic tone of voice that she would get our server. We ended up leaving before she came back because the customer service was just so bad. I would not recommend if you're looking for friendly service."
0,Another Chicken & Burger joint that has popped up over by Boulevard Mall...so I decided to give it a go.\n\nLocated inside the Seafood Supermarket I had NO IDEA it was a filipino fast food franchise..It simply READ Chicken & Burgers...\n\nI don't really have much to say on this one....I barely got past the smell of the burger to take the one bite I tried before spitting it out. Definitely an acquired taste because the place was packed and everyone else seemed to be enjoying the chicken meals not too many eating burgers:(
1,"Big portions, great price, good food.  I'll have to come back and try some new dishes.  There's a lot on the menu"
0,"I hadn't been to Fuddruckers for about 20 years... now I know why.  Cashier was nice and very helpful.  I ordered bacon cheese burger combo.  Fries were only warm, not hot.  Burger was not very tasty and it was full of gristle bits... you know the ones that stick between your teeth.  Lots of trash on the floor.  After we were finished, someone came to ask how things were.  I told here about the fries and she offered to get me more; I declined.  She offered a free dessert: I accepted.  In all, not a good experience, will probably be at least another 20 years before I go back."
1,"This is a real treat for anyone who wants to get some faith back in great restaurant food that is not overpriced, especially considering the quality of food they serve: organic meats, never-frozen fish, and generous portions."
1,"What a rare little gem this place is! Waterfront (lakeside) French bistro and wine shop in Vegas...a charming setting. I love dining on the patio where geese and ducks swim up to the open patio windows...just makes me smile! The setting is serene and romantic, and, the service and cuisine are great."
1,"It's neck and neck with Bacchanal buffet. Both are the best buffets I've had in Vegas . The Buffet serves traditional American food with a twist and more. The decor is sooo pretty and whimsical and the service is always great!\n\nCame here for BREAKFAST on our last day in Vegas and it was amazing. $21 per person is a great price. Their food selection was very impressive for breakfast. So many different kinds of parfaits, egg dishes, pancake station, fresh fruits, cereal station, the best California rolls, variety of meats, and they serve crab legs and the most succulent shrimp cocktail for breakfast OMG! Everything we had was delicious.\n\nMy favs...\n-Shrimp cocktail\n-lobster fritata\n-California rolls (best I've ever had at any buffets)\n-smoked salmon\n-banana and nutella parfait\n-watermelon infused with tequila\n-prime rib (amazing)\n-Thai chicken wings (wished i could eat more)\n\nTheir dessert selection was more of classic and traditional and not too creative and unique in my opinion compare to other buffets. But it's still delicious.\n\nI took off 1 star because of how the cashier area is set up. The people who already paid are crowded around the cashier area making it a bit difficult for the people waiting to pay to squeeze in. People behind us were complaining to staff. But other than that, I highly recommend this buffet!"

0,"Had a chicken burrito lunch special. Filling consisted of 90% cooked onions, 10% chicken.  Good service and good chips and salsa but serving the worst burrito I've ever had in my life is an automatic fail. The fact that this abomination of a recipe somehow made it on menu of a restaurant is pretty shocking. Even if there had been more chicken, the flavor was just horrible..."
1,"I broke the screen on my iPhone 5 and searched the prices all around town. This place had the best price so naturally I decided to check them out (they were also open later than most repair shops). I was so happy when I walked in! Nice and clean environment, very friendly staff. Tony is the one who fixed my screen. Later to find out that I also broke the camera on my phone and bent the entire frame! Wow...I was expecting to have to pay way more than I did. I ended up buying a tempered glass screen cover and paid less than I would have to replace just the screen anywhere else. He treated me very well! All in all it was a great experience. Check this place out, you won't regret it :)"
0,"I've been here 3 times and still I cant figure out why its so popular...\nThe pastries are slightly better than a Twinkie and their version of cappuccino is a burned milk latte with some foam on top (like Starbucks)\nIt's also overcrowded most of the time, so your drink may take between 5 to 15 minutes..."
0,"Small, cramped, and serving the same disgusting chicken that this chain always has. Unfortunately, the KFC on Indian School is also a pit, so if you're craving fried chicken in South Scottsdale the only good option you have is LoLo's.\n\nThe second star is because the employees were nice."
1,"So we're moving out of our house and trying to get everything cleaned up to make it presentable. After having some other services come in I have to say I'm sick of people coming in and trying press me to up charge my Groupons.  I want the service I paid for.  With Luiz, this was not the case.  While he did mention there was a possibility for a deeper clean, he wasn't pushy about it at all.  I opted for the Groupon cleaning and was very happy!\n\nAfter getting all set up, Luiz and his partner made sure to explaine their products and how they were chemical free.  Very important with my daughter and dog running around.  The total job took about 30 minutes and, if you look at my before and after pics, it was awesome!  We haven't had our grout cleaned since we've lived in our house.  That's 5 years of disgusting that he cleaned up in no time.\n\nI am big on customer service and I have to say, this guy had to be one of the nicest people I have ever met.  He talked to me the whole time while doing his job and actually seemed like he cared about informing about the History of Grout.  If we weren't moving out of state I would definitely use this company again for carpets, grout, and anything else they provide.  I highly recommend snagging this Groupon and telling Luiz that Patrick sent you!"
1,"I came here for my sister's 21st. We ordered the cilantro jalape\u00f1o hummus, smoked Ancho chili goat cheese eggplant dip, thai peanut black quinoa summer rolls,  and smoked gouda mac and cheese.  Everything was amazing! !!!!!!! Our server Heather was really nice too!! I definitely want to come back soon!"
1,"This is my second time coming here for lunch and it was delicious!\n\nTodd English Olives is located across from Tiffany's and really close to the side Valet.  Super easy in & out!\n\nWe sat our on the patio, when it was like 90-100 degrees.  There weren't any misters on yet and the fountains NEVER went off during our entire hour+ lunch.  Kind of a bummer.\n\nService was pretty good.  The server forgot my guests drink twice, but it was quickly replenished when we brought it up.\n\nI ordered:\nChilled Crab Salad\nmixed greens, asparagus, shaved fennel, cucumber, roma tomato, red onion,\nmandarin segments, red pepper coulis, champagne vinaigrette.....$17\n*It was perfect for a super hot day!\n\nMy guest ordered a flatbread and really enjoyed it.\n\nI also ordered a flavored iced tea that was really good (maybe it was peach?)\n\nI would definitely come back here- very good for a business lunch!"
1,"Everyone else has covered the burgers but I'm a shake fiend.  These are made from real ice cream in the stainless steel shake containers that are HUGE.  You can make any combo like amaretto + peanut butter +chocolate & no one bats an eye like how can you drink that...    The onion rings are ok, fries are standard, but if you don't have time to wait for your burger, don't come cuz the sign says they are not fast food."
1,The Diavolo pizza is the best pizza I've ever had! Way better than Bicanco! It's a must have is you like a little kick with your pizza.
1,Carl's cakes really should have more than 3.5 stars. I think partially the problem is a lot of reviews from bridezillas who didn't get their crazy expectations met. They admit to the great flavor of the cakes but then downgrade the stars because the shade of pink was wrong.\n\nAnyways someone had brought leftover wedding cake into my work lounge. I tried a small bite was amazed! Spent the course of the day trying to find out who brought this amazing cake and where it is from!  Turns out Carl's cakes and the flavor I tried was hazelnut apricot.\n\nI went to see what they offered at the market street diner in terms of variety. I was please that they have 4 or 5 cakes that you can get individual slices from but also a cooler with ready to go full cakes in a variety of flavors. I ended up getting a hazelnut apricot cake good for about 8 to 10 people for only 16 bucks. What a steal! Where can you get a awesome cake for that price nowadays. \n\nThey also do cheesecakes which I know will lure me back at some point.
0,"The people who work here are very nice, however they are very inept when it comes to closings. They never close any files on time and if your closing falls towards the end of the month, which most do, they are very busy and don't return phone calls or e-mails. If you are unlucky enough to be forced into closing at this location be sure to stay on top of them and be prepared to close late. Top 5 worst closings we've ever had and we close over 125 homes a year."
1,"I love this place enough to spend 75% of my lunchtime driving to get to it on occasion. Everything I have tried is absolutely delicious! I've had the gyro salad, and the grilled chicken salad.  Mmm mmm good! The sauce they use is very flavorful, and the pita bread is great."
1,"I think this could be considered a modern day juke joint.  Lots of fun though, great music.  Prices on drinks are okay, they had moscato so I was pretty happy.  The place was packed the two times we went on our 5 day vacation.  Bathroom situation is rough though, just FYI."
1,"I've been here three or four times, and in all those times I've only been disappointed by a single cupcake that seemed to be a bit too dry to have any real flavor. However, I can now say that that instance seems to be the exception rather than the rule. I always have to get a red velvet, and my new favorites after this holiday season are the salted caramel and pumpkin spice. It's like magic in my mouth.\n\nOne comment though - none of these workers ever forget to bring their enthusiasm to work. Normally I would list that comment as a compliment, but when the first thing I hear at 9:00 in the morning is \""OmG isn't life just MARvelous and OmG you are FLYING home today and you DON'T live here?! Well that's SO exciting and we will TOTALLY get you a bag that you can take your cupcakes in, OBviously\"" - let's just say it is a little overwhelming.\n\nAnd fair warning, you really need to love cupcakes to be willing to pay $22 for 6. But let's be serious, I'm definitely going again next week when I'm back in town :)"

I guess since I'm short, everything just looks bigger to me because I ended up picking out a child size club and didn't notice until we were 1/3 through the game and someone said, \""Why are you bending over so far to hit the ball?\"" I quickly ran over and changed it; No problem there, just a few laughs. \n\nBefore this, I've never gone cosmic golfing before, so I thought it was SO COOL. Everything was glowing under the black light, even our teeth. It was kind of funny because I wouldn't be able to see my boyfriend's face until he smiled or opened his mouth to talk. At the same time, it kind of sucked because I noticed how much lint I had on my sweater! There were neon green turtles, orange octopuses, blue gorillas, a lion with a crown, and jungle paintings on the walls. Sounds pretty awesome, right? It was!\n\nThere are 18 holes and four of us, so we were there for about 45 minutes or so. For less than 20 bucks for all of us, we got to enjoy a very fun (and different) mini golf experience. \n\nTips:\n*Make sure you don't pick out a child size club like I did\n*Go on a day when there's a special, so you get an awesome deal:\nWednesdays:  Family Night.  Each member of the family will receive a $2 discount.  Just ask!  \n-Thursdays:  Date Night.  If you are on a date, one person pays, the other is free!  Just ask!  \n*This place is in the same plaza as Create, so you can grab some gourmet burgers when you're all done\n*Make sure you don't wear anything with some weird stains that will be detected with the black light!"
1,"Rolled in last Saturday...still hot so we sat inside. Great atmosphere...service kind of slow however our waiter was very helpful. We ordered margaritas (platinum) they were served in a shaker A+ for that as we re-filled our glasses twice-good value. The chips were a bit stale the salsa OK, the flavored tortillas were great! I ordered the pork chops the wife a salad...the wife liked her salad and my chops were fantastic....the portions of both meals were huge A++. The overall dining experience with atmosphere was a solid 3-1/2 stars so I will round up because our waiter did a great job."
0,Clothes have never been fresh and crisp. More like you do at home with damp rag and a hand steamer. \n\nThey also want to charge to use a credit card. Almost 20% in my case and their prices are just not that cheap by any means. \n\nThey have never been friendly and will leave you waiting at the counter with out acknowledging you are even there until they are good and ready to help you. \n\nI've been there three times because I try to give people the benefit of the doubt. Well three strikes your out. Even my two stars is really too generous.
1,"Fun!  Purchased a groupon with friends and we all loved it.  I like how painting is paired with wine here.  Gia's steps are easy to follow and I'm pretty happy with my paintings.  The only thing is, it's so expensive.  I would only do it again as a date, for a fundraising event, or with a group of girlfriends.\n\nI've gone twice already.  Once with a groupon and once for an Alzheimer's fundraising event.  I really enjoyed the fundraising event because I like to spend money that I know will be donated to a good cause.  Go Gia!\n\nGia and her mother also sell cute attire and accessories.  A little over-priced, but they are a family owned business so it makes sense for it to be a little more expensive."
1,"The salads here are absolutely delicious and there is so many choices to choose from! The service was so nice and I enjoyed that the hosts and servers were all wearing their normal attire. The building was so unique and I loved the decor in the place. \n\nI got the Greek Salad, I highly recommend it!"
1,"Here's my take. First off the shit is free before 9 o clock or whenever they charge a cover so if you're a smart mutha fucka like myself you get your stamp then and then you're good for all night. Second, even when they do charge a cover it's only like $10 bucks, if you can't handle a $10 cover in Vegas then what in the blue fuck are you doing there? You got the \""Coyotes\"" up in there doing the dancing thing and they seem to have all genres of lady, black, white, brunette, blonde, thick, slim, tom boyish etc. There seem to be a good bit of international cougars in here like from Europe and Australia, they let em dance on the stage so you can see which one you wanna holla at and then when they come down you swoop on em and introduce yourself like a gentleman and offer the lady a drink. It's what the fuck gentleman do. Drinks aren't the cheapest but you can pre-game at the bar outside and then go in there ready to meet you a nice young lady so you can enjoy your evening and have a Vegas moment."
1,"I love that this place is just down the street from my office! The first time I ate here was the day we moved in and I was starving. I think the chicken cesar wrap was the best I ever had because of that fact, I've had it since and it's still pretty dang good for $6. Everything here is pretty basic food you could make at home but it's always better when someone else makes it for you right? Panini's, wraps, salads and sandwiches are all very good here and prices are extremely reasonable. \n\nI haven't tried many of the beverages but the smoothies are tasty and their white chocolate mocha beats Starbucks easily in my book."
0,"I had a little extra time before work this morning so I stopped in to have my eyebrows tamed (they really needed it). The threader seemed to know what she was doing and I was confident. I didn't experience very much pain during the session, except for a few times when the thread broke. She made good conversation, and it was a really pleasant experience until she handed me the mirror and I noticed blood spots on my brow; I've never bled from threading, even on occasions where it hurt like hell. I was kind of baffled, paid, tipped the threader and went on my way. \n\nI got into the car and went on my way; about 10 minutes later my eyebrows started to burn a little. 12 hours later, they're still very tender, and have seemed to scab over. Wanted to give this place 2 stars because the service was so pleasant, but this is the absolute worst threading experience I've ever had."
0,"Decided to give this place a try....First, let me say the bartenders could use a bit more personality.  With that said, we ordered a chicken cutlet sandwich and was told it was big enough for 2.  Well, yes it was, but was no larger than a large Subway.  the sauce was acidy and very spicy. Not hot spicy, but spicy.  SALTY as well.  The salad that came with it would have been much better with just a simple oil and vinegar dressing with pepper and salt.  The dressing was piled on it, making the lettuce soggy.  I think it was comprised of some sort of soured cream and lemon mixture. and SALT once again.  We each had one glass of wine and the bill was a staggering 46.00 with tip.  I could have gone to Russo's for a much better sandwich, for a lot less. Nope, won't be going back.  Too many other better places here in Vegas, on and off strip."
0,"Worst casino on the strip in my opinion, worst buffet as well. Only come here if you must so you can entertain your children."
1,"I've been bringing my dog to Ann Road Animal Hospital since he was a puppy, and have always gotten friendly service and wonderful treatment from the vets there.\nI love the walk-in service (no appointments) and Sundays is my favorite day to visit them. They always love to see Buddy and I will definitely keep going there as long as I live here in Vegas!"
1,"Both the beef chow fun wide noodle, and the mixed vegetable with lightly fried tofu, were excellent. The noodle dish was among the best I've had, which was portioned just right for three hungry people, and was free of any excess oil. The vege dish was a colorful medley of quality freshness and variety. Combined with quick and friendly service, I'll be back for more!"
1,"Archis is my favorite thai place of all time! I can go on and on about their food. Their tom yum, tom kha, pad thai, papaya salad, and thai tea are my favs!!! oh and their pad prik king (sp?) yum!  Ive tried other thai places, and i always come running back to archis!!\n\nthe only one complaint i have was a couple of times there was this one guy server that seemed like he was saying \""FML FML FML\"" in his head everytime he served us.  Seemed like he didnt want to be there or serve us.  so everytime I ate there i prayed i didnt have him as my server.  Other than him, everyone else is very friendly and the food is awesome!!!"
0,"Hands down the worst target I've ever been to. Grew up in this neighborhood and even in high school it was still a nightmare. Unorganized, dirty, never well-stocked and the patrons...YIKES. I know that probably shouldn't factor into my rating but good God, this is the one place I am guaranteed to be run over by a rogue cart of a mother of 8 kids under the age 10 who's letting one of those 8 wield the cart. Unacceptable."
0,"With so many sushi places in Vegas, you'd think they'd give better service to attract customers. To begin with there was a long wait to be seated, even after our table opened up. The server pretty much ignored our party. We had to remind them of our orders, the last two rolls took forever to be delivered to the table. Will not return here and honestly don't suggest it. On a positive note, the strawberry mochi was good."
1,"Considering that finding delivery in South Phoenix is nearly impossible, this place is a gem. We stopped in to get take out because they do not have an online menu, and we were rather pleasantly surprised by the quality and flavor of the food, not to mention the great prices... Under $4 for lunch??? Seriously!.  The staff was friendly and the food was quickly prepared and hot when we drove it home.  We would order from here again in a heartbeat."
1,"Vegan coconut cake...are you kidding me? Moist, crunchy toasted coconut shavings, thick creamy coconut frosting...I just shed a tear. Mandala Tea Room is such a delight! I am forever a slave to their desserts and teas."
0,"I was soooo looking forward to coming here. I even dragged my friend and his grandson here to share the experience. But when we arrived, I looked at the sparse counter with 4 styrofoam containers of who-knows-what sitting in the display case. I looked at the 4 parties in front of us who had obviously ordered and were growing weary from waiting. And... I saw a small tray of fried chicken under a heat lamp and one cook looking frazzled.\n\nCute menu board posted on the wall. But... I wasn't going to become one of those poor souls starving and rubbing my eyes as I waited 45 minutes for a couple pieces of chicken.\n\nSuggestion: get more help and make the waiting area more comfortable."
1,"I had the steak burger ($9) and it was quite good. They actually made it medium rare (I've had trouble getting anything rarer than medium in Pittsburgh when I order medium rare). It comes on a long soft, roll- it's definitely different, but palatable nonetheless. The burger had a nice char on the outside and was still juicy on the inside. It came with a mix of regular fries and sweet potato and those were a nice touch. I had a brown ale of sorts ($4.50) and it was not too malty and not too heavy. Service was quick and the staff was helpful."
1,"Best Sandwiches I've had in my life!!!! My friend and I came here after a crazy weekend. We heard about how good this place was from other people. As soon as we got there we knew it must be good cause there was a loooong line!! About 30min later we ordered what we wanted. I ordered the Tuna Melt and the Caribbean Jerk Chicken. My friend got the Meatball one and the Tuna Melt. After waiting anxiously for our sandwiches, our order was finally ready. I took my first bite into the Tuna Melt and it was so freaking good I almost cried. Crunchy warm toasted bread, soft flaky tuna with perfectly gooey melted cheese. Best Tuna Melt ever!!!!! The Caribbean Jerk Chicken was pretty good too but nothing compared to that perfect Tuna Melt. Earl of Sandwich..... I will never have a sandwich elsewhere. Definitely coming back whenever I'm in Vegas!! Hopefully this time I won't lose money on my way in..."
1,"Menu fran\u00e7ais classique un peu trop vaste,beaux vins,service courtois et competent,prix corrects.ce restaurant \u00e0 d\u00e9j\u00e0 connu des jours meilleurs,mais garde une exellente r\u00e9putation ."
1,"Typical comedy club with a 2 drink minimum. They pack a full house and put on great shows. I saw Anjelah Johnson and Mal Hall. \n\nWe had reserved seating as we accompanied family members. No seats are really better than others unless you are seated at the foot of the stage.\n\nSimilar to another review I had a server spill steak sauce all over my leg and arm. There was no apology or even recognition of their mistake. I didn't expect anything just disappointed there wasn't any acknowledgment.\n\nAfter the show I had a chance to go back stage for photos, small talk, and good times. The greenroom is quite small about 20x20 is all. \n\nA little tip is to arrive early and enjoy some drinks next door at the bar instead of exceeding your 2 drink minimum. Drink prices are a little over priced but the appetizers are worth the money! Got to try the Nachos!\n\nGreat times, enjoy the show!"
1,"These guys do a great job! Very good food and a very professional, friendly staff. Refreshing after the slew of mediocre restaurants that were there before."
0,"Like many people I've been here for the 99 cent shooters on Thursdays. They're tiny, and taste like kool aid. We tried pretty much all of them on the menu and I think you have to order 4 at a time. They're sickeningly sweet and just make you super thirsty.\n\nAlso had the nachos which were below average, cheese feels plasticy.\n\nThis place is often full and I'm sure it's fine for cheap beer and a get together with friends to watch a sports game, but it's not a place I want to hang out at. There are soooo many nice bars in Montreal, don't settle for this!"
0,"Topped with a Costa coffee and with a McDonald's as its foundation the Princes Mall isn't the most appealing shopping centre.\n\nSandwiched in between these mediocre high street brands are an assortment of clothing shops, whisky shops and beauty orientated stores.\n\nYou'll no doubt have a curious wander through the Princes Mall and then exit with limited buys and limited enthusiasm for the dreary interior."
1,"Been coming to TexAz since 1985, back in the \""Lonestar Steak\"" days. Never had a bad meal, had bad service just once in all that time, and 23 years later the prices aren't that much higher either. If I'm ever convicted of murder and sentenced to death my final meal has to be the Mulligan prime rib medium rare with mashed potatoes and that to-die-for cream gravy. I take friends here and buy them dinner just to see that look on their face when they see their plate for the first time. I've had everything on the menu except the catfish and all of it is great! I'd write more but I'm hungry now. See you there..."
1,"Very courteous and helpful. Made mailing my UPS and FedEx packages super easy. He even taped up my package for me free of charge. Stop at Target or the nearby Walgreens on your way if you want cheaper packaging. It's a business, you pay for convenience. Overall, a very positive experience."
1,"wow, i just tried the mocha cappuccino blended boba.  one of the best flavors ever!  you can definitely taste the mocha chocolate!"
0,"The food at this place makes cardboard taste like fine dining. Fantastic service, crappy \""Mexican\"" food. That being said, the first couple of bites were phenomenal - and really only because we went here after one of the EDC nights. Basically, we got back to our rooms at the Hard Rock around 7am...I showered/cleaned up, because there's just no way I can bring myself to sleep without taking a shower after EDC, then we all woke up around 10, cleaned up, checked out, then headed to Pink Tacos around 12:30. The last meal I'd had was breakfast...the previous day (don't judge! who has time to eat or sleep in Vegas anyways??!!?!)."
1,"Space Invader, Banksey, scrumptious coffee and baked goods.\n\nRelaxing and hip, Mad House (It's a Grind) Coffee is the perfect place to come relax and get some work done.  The Free Wifi is awesome (take note starbucks, you cheap monsters) and the coffee is brewed nice and strong.  Fear not lovers of frappe's and sweet drinks, they do those very well too.\n\nLooking around the shop, its clear that the owner put his heart into this place.  I love when the personality of the owners shine through in a business, and the artwork on the wall demonstrates this well.  Work by the street artists Space Invader and Bansky adorn the walls, along with some Keith Herring designs.  Not to rain on the Las Vegas establishments sense of art, but it was really refreshing to be in a place where Georgia O'Keefe prints or neon beer signs were no where to be seen.\n\nThe pastries here are very tasty.  I sat down to a pumpkin tirmasu and an espresso recently.  The espresso was wonderfully bold and satisfying.  The pumpkin tiramisu was creamy, rich, and fun.  I wished I wasn't by myself, as the slice was huge and I couldn't finish it.  \n\nThere is also a drive-thru and this place is 24 hours!  I forget the owner's name, but he was very nice.  He told me a lot of the artwork had special importance to him and his wife.  Things like this make a simple cup of espresso taste refreshingly fantastic.  \n\nThey say the pasta in Italy is so much better because you're in Italy.  I found the coffee to follow suit here, since the atmosphere is so warm, welcoming, and wonderful."
0,"By far one of my least favorite places I've eaten. We got there for happy hour after waiting a long time for our server to come and take our order we got chips, salsa & guacamole as well as the cheese quesadillas. The quesadillas were strange, they were in a light flaky flour tortilla which was then ruined by their strange choice of pickled peppers and almost too much cheese, the peppers made the bottom soggy. We were waiting for our entrees, which were... Ok, we sat in the bar area freezing to the bone. While eating, I was watching our server take care of bar patrons as well as the patrons sitting at the tables in the bar area. As a server, I've never seen such a thing, where we happen to be sitting I could see the hostess stand where there happened to be 3 people just standing around (waiting to greet customers), while letting the poor guy at the bar run his ass off while other customers had to wait for him to finish taking care of everyone in that area. How is this place run?!"
0,"***DAYCLUB REVIEW ONLY***\n\nIf GTL is your lifestyle...then you would fit in perfectly at the Marquee Dayclub. Just saying.\n\nI really love Marquee as a nightclub because the pool area looks so classy and gorgeous at night, but during the day I wouldn't be able to tell this pool apart from a frat house pool.\nMe & my friends LITERALLY stayed at the dayclub for less than 30 minutes. In fact, some of the poor guys in line said to us as we were leaving \""That great, huh?\"". \n\nThe pool area is just too small to fit that many people. Whats the point of going to a pool party if there's so many people you can't even get into the pool?\nMaybe if you had a table the experience would be better because you'd actually have a place to sit & lounge.\n\nIts like a really crowded public pool filled with guys. Sound like fun?"
1,Has anodyne coffee from Milwaukee (best I've ever had in my young life) makes a nice San Francisco BLT (BLT with guac) served with a side salad. Great place to read a book or study.
0,"Wednesday night, latin dance event.  There were about 40-50 people there for the opening night.  Good DJ who I know from elsewhere, we were having a fine time until suddenly the lights came on at 11:20 and management closed the place down due to \""not enough liquor sales at the bar\"".  \n\nWell okay then, alcohol was pricey and bartenders were stingy anyway.  Never again."
1,Many great dishes but the stand out for me: the freshie rolls! The best gluten-free spring rolls in Phoenix!
1,"Delicious, cheap, and generous portions! I used to go to a different sushi restaurant for all you can eat sushi but my boyfriend heard about this place from a friend so we decided to try it out. I'm so happy we did! It gets really busy but it's totally worth the wait and crowded atmosphere. They put a lot of fish in the sushi and the portion sizes are awesome! Their presentation of the food looks just as delicious as the taste! Overall, my new favorite sushi restaurant!!"
1,Good authentic Sonoran hot dogs. Prices for the burros were a little high but were tasty. Would frequent again.
0,We were very disappointed in this restaurant as the other reviews and photos looked so good!  We went for breakfast and the portions were small and lacked flavor.  We will not go back.  We should have stuck with the hotel's buffet.
0,Awful place. \n\nIf you are trying to go there for good drinks this is an OK place to go to but the food was horrible. The tapas ceviche was $10 which came with 4 shrimp and was topped with popcorn (I have no idea why). If they were trying to go for fun and innovative food this place completely missed the mark. The potatoes and chorizo came in an extremely small portions and where bland. Not to mention the paella which was $25 and the rice was not well cooked. This place takes small portions to a new level. Overall I left that place with $80 less and still hungry. Not worth the money and the food was a complete disappointment. The only reason this place is getting two stars is because of their drinks.
0,"Danny's, why oh why did you leave me waiting for my car without telling me it was done? I came here to get my car detailed and they said it would take awhile so I grabbed my book and waited in the main area. After awhile of waiting inside, the air was getting too stiff, so I decided to move out to the fresh air and deal with the heat. I waited on the benches where they dry the cars. I waited and I waited. Finally after waiting nearly an hour, I decided to ask someone. I asked a man working there and he looks around, points to my car that's behind me in a random parking spot hidden from where I was waiting, and says the car's been ready for 20 minutes. However, nobody told me! I was sitting there and they saw me waiting (and mind you, I was the only one waiting), but nobody told me my car was ready. Who knows how much longer I would have waited if I hadn't asked. I was pretty disappointed in the lack of customer service and sadly, I don't think I will return to this Danny's anytime soon."
0,"I walked into the store for the first time this week. It's nicely laid out, but no one offered to help me find anything after I wandered around the store for 10 minutes. No one acknowledged me when I came in or when I left, or ever showed the slightest interest in helping me. All the products are also really overpriced and can be found more cheaply at a department store. $10 for a bottle of nail polish? No thanks! I will not be going back."
1,"I've  reviewed another Cracker Barrel in the past, and this location lives up to the all-american constant that I've come to expect from Cracker Barrels.\nIts a tradition for my sister and I to have a meal at Cracker Barrel when I come to visit her, so we headed straight over there when I got off the train yesterday morning. I was pleasantly surprised to be seated without a wait- it was about 10:45 in the morning and the parking lot was PACKED (post-church crowd?).  But we must have come in at the perfect time because there was one empty, clean table- and it was ours!\nOur server was very nice, our food came out quickly and tasted great. You know how sometimes when food comes out really fast it tastes old like they made it earlier and waited for someone to order it? This wasn't the case. It was all piping hot and fresh. The odds were ever in our favor."
1,"After the yelp elite event (which was fantastic) I knew I had to return to Sammy's for a meal.  I'm glad I did.  I had lunch on a weekday and it was busy.  Not packed, but at least half full.  Very brisk business.  I sat in the kind of half couch tables that face the bar.  VERY comfortable and unique.  Had a good view of the TV, but you have to turn your head slightly.  Service was a little spotty as the bartender was busy.  This is why I usually don't sit in the bar area at restaurants when I am dining.  However, once I ordered, my food was out very quickly.\n\nI had the sliders with fries and added gorgonzola cheese.  Fantastic.  The bun is soft and toasty and did not fall apart.  This was particularly impressive as the burger was JUICY.  The patties are flavorful.  I could use a little more of the sauce, next time I order them I'll probably ask for more on the side.  The fries are good, thin and crispy with some nice seasoning.  \n\nCool design and atmosphere with a comprehensive menu.  We'll definitely come back."
1,This is by far the best Greek I've had. Our family visits here often. My wife is vegetarian and loves the spanakopita. It is really big and she loves it! I get the gyro with fries. Both are so flavorful. The fries have homemade spices on top. This appears to be own by a family. The mom is always in the kitchen cooking and the children help with seating and orders. We've done sit down and take out. Both are great!
1,"Expensive.  But worth it.  Beautiful fabrics, totes, clothes, throws, etc. Friendly staff.  Definitely worth a trip inside for a look!"
1,"My fianc\u00e9 and I dined at Mercadito not long after it's opening so I went in under the assumption that there would be some kinks that would need to be worked out, but that was definitely not the case. The staff was super friendly and our busser was very attentive. \n\nThe food was excellent (definitely try the guac with bacon... Mmmmmm bacon....). Enchiladas were hot and flavorful. Cocktails were great and the chocolate cake lava dessert? Fantastic! I'll be back!"
0,"At one time Spanish Trail was extremely beautiful, had spectacular up to date facilities, and served incredible food. It was classy and special. Things have changed. Certain times of the year Spanish Trail can be pretty, but they're slow to replace anything dead or overgrown. Facilities aren't up to date and don't get renovated as often they should. Things that do get renovated are usually things that don't need to be renovated. The food is mediocre at best and overpriced. Just because you enjoyed something this week, it doesn't mean it will be good the next time you order it. Anything really goes on the golf course, tennis courts and fitness center. I've seen dogs using the fairway as a bathroom, kids riding their bikes all over the course, and etc. If you want some classy, special or some incredible experience, then Spanish Trail probably isn't what you're looking for, but if you just want to play somewhere different then Spanish Trail is ok."
1,"Terri, owner of Paradox Makeup Artistry & Aesthetics, is an amazing artist. Every look is flawless, she really takes into account the client's facial shape and individual details to plan out the perfect makeover and then takes her time to be sure everything is on-point. Terri really listens to her client's desires and her bombshell makeovers are beyond astounding. She worked with me at an event this past weekend and not only did I get to see her amazing artistry on dozens of clients but I myself got a bombshell makeover. She is a whiz at eyebrows and contouring! I got more compliments that day than I ever have. She's a professional through and through and a sweetheart too. I would not hesitate to hire her in the future and I highly recommend her."
0,"Here's a suggestion, if your restaurant is dead and there's someone waiting to place a to go order, how about u tell the staff to tend to them instead of performig their unenthused dance routine for nobody.  Poor prioritizing!!"
1,There was something wrong with my meal that was completely out of the staffs control and they did not hesitate making it right.  The assistant manager even came over and went above and beyond.  I will continue to visit this wonderful restaurant.
0,"This is the worst place ever!!!!!! The people are ugly. It costs way too much. The place is dirty wouldn't be surprised if you could get an STD by just sitting in one of there nasty seats. The drinks cost way to much and on top of the $30 cover there is a 2 drink minimum. The biggest waste of time in Vegas.\n\nAnd FYI not \""gay friendly\"" just if your wondering"
0,"Yep, 2.5-stars is about right.  The best thing about this 24hr joint is the design.  Oh-my-God is it a feast for the eyes.  I mean if you're going to shell out for some meh late night food, it might as well be in the swankiest place right?  Service was good, but the food...not so much.  Overpriced?  You bet."
0,Haven't event gotten my food yet the service fucking sucks I don't even know why I didn't leave and go upstairs to McDonald's they have better service than this shit hole!
1,"completely forgot about this place until just now! came here about 4 months ago. my boyfriend was running in the Rock and Roll marathon so his mom and i decided to eat breakfast here. now when we got here it was prob like 6am?? since we had to drop him off for the race, so there was really no one in the restaurant. they had a lot of ppl on staff which was good-even tho it wasnt that crowded. but prob once the breakfast rush started to come in. we both ordered the protein pancakes. now it comes with 2 but our waitress told us we could just get one since they are really big and have a lot of good stuff in them! we also ordered fruit on the side. now when she said \""big\"" i was thinking like Ihop or Denny's size, but they really are BIG!! like huge. prob the size of a large dinner plate. it was really good tho, and very filling! i would def come back again to try their other food!!"
1,"One of the best places I've eaten in a long time! We split the new york strip steak, roasted asparagus, mashed potatoes, then the funnel cake for dessert. Everything was so delicious and cooked perfectly! Service was excellent and if you can, get a seat outside cause it's a great view and they even do a show. Definitely coming back here next time we visit!"
1,"One word...AMAZING!\n\nFour star moved from their location on Henry St. to N. Broom, but the experience hasn't changed. \n\nTo me, there's no better video-rental experience than walking into, and perusing the isles of an actual store. \n\nFour Star has an amazing selection of movies in their new two-story spot (equipped with an ultra rad spiral staircase).\n\nYou can sense the passion the employees have for what they do, and they're always more than willing to help you find what you're looking for. \n\nIn the age of Netflix and piracy, Four Star stands as a testament to the old school of video renting, a school I hope to forever be enrolled."
0,"If I could give 0 stars I would. They always take a really long time to make crepes.  The ingredients are not fresh.  My last and final visit I had the older Asian guy making my 3 crepes. He was very rude.  He made on crepe handed it to me then rang other guests. Walked in the back, made the drink orders for several other guests. Then, made the second crepe and again same thing with the 3rd crepe.  \nThey need to get training on how to make crepes.  My advice is go to Bellagio and watch how they make crepes."
1,"The best sushi in the valley. The owners are great. They give tremendous service and always make you feel at home. We usually get sushi and a couple of rolls when we go, and they are so fresh. We like to try a new roll every time and they have yet to disappoint us. It is a small place, so we try and go on off hour times, so we can sit at the sushi bar and talk. Because KC is the only sushi chef right now, he was training a new one the day we were there, The place fills up quick. I've read where people say the service is slow, but sushi is an art and even when it's busy he get the food out in a timely manner. Doesn't any restaurant slow down when they get busy? I would recommend Sushi Catcher to everyone. It's a great small family business."
1,"I had somewhat high hopes, and I like their logo, the building and the restaurant design. The service was a bit odd - the server seemed confused, and they were out of some drinks and food. We pushed on and each had a bowl of ramen - mine was pork based with garlic and kimchi - similar to what I've had on Honshu near Korea. It was OK - and certainly nothing like authentic. The edamame was above average. Worried about their survival as Arizona needs ramen shops of every quality."
0,Cab showed up 15 min late for ride to airport. Driver asked for a jug of water to put into his rad because the cab was poorly maintained. AC did not work. Driver asked me if I knew where the speed cameras were. Driver blasted talk radio on the topic of suicide?? Short trips... Maybe. Longer trips.... I'm looking elsewhere.
0,"DO NOT COME TO CANTERS. STAY AWAY!!\n\nthis is probably the whackest sandwich i've ever had. look at my reviews, I feel terrible giving out single star ratings and usually add-on a few in a desperate attempt to salvage the review.. but in this case. i'd give it zero if I could.\n\n-$12.75 FOR TURKEY ON RYE TO-GO.\n-TWO PIECES OF HARD, STALE BREAD AND A FEW SLICES OF TURKEY.

0,Way overpriced food which isn't an authentic Mexican restaurant. Mexican food is one of my favorite cuisines but this restaurant didn't deliver. Food is ok but won't recommend it.
1,"Absolutely wonderful! Went here with a friend, shared fried pickles, she got the Plain Jane burger and I got the Three Little Pigs sandwich, and everything was delicious! My sandwich had what I believe was bacon, ham, and some kind of fried pork on it with swiss and an egg over easy on huge grilled bread, and it was incredible! The fried egg really made the sandwich. The fired pickles came with some kind of spicy ranch sauce, and they were great- seasoned well, thick, and a great portion to share for two for only $5. Totally recommend!"
0,"Came here with a group of 5 near closing time. They were happy to take us but I could tell they weren't ecstatic. My friends are also crazy and decided to order a lot of food. We started out with calamari and stuffed mushrooms for an appetizer. Then, ordered the lobster, steak, and a pasta dish. My friend intended to order a second pasta dish but the server recommended us not to. My friend has been here before so he was aware that he was ordering a lot. He wanted variety, not necessarily quantity. A few minutes after she took our order, she came back out with her manager and she told us that what we ordered was ridiculous and warned us against it. It was nice that they did that but kind of annoying too. We already got warned the first time. \n\nAnyways, the food was great. Lobsters were huge and the steak was cooked perfectly. The only thing that annoyed me about eating the lobster was that it was so messy. I was wearing a white dress and got red sauce splattered all over myself. Do not wear white. We also weren't given lobster shell breaking utensils. They brought it out but left it sitting at the table next to us. We didn't realize until halfway through our meal. Oh well. \n\nNeedless to say, we had a crazy amount of food and ended up taking home boxes of food that fed my family for the next few days. I definitely would not have changed it though. It was a lot of food but each dish was huge. I'd rather have variety cause I know I definitely would have gotten tired of eating the same thing the entire meal."
0,Service was OK.\n\nUnderwhelming Gringo Mexican food.\n\nChef specialties don't come with rice & beans...\n\nCheese crisp was greasy even for a cheese crisp.\n\nI kept thinking I could have eaten here and had much better food for less:\n\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz/el-ranchero-chandler
0,"I really want to like this Native New Yorker as it is close to my house.  I have been to various locations around the Valley and generally enjoy the food and atmosphere.  This location though is woefully inconsistent in both food quality and service.\n\nSince this location has been open I have been disappointed that one week food quality is great but then the next time food is either under or over cooked.  Specifically the Chicken Wings, it's a roll of the dice wether your wings will be undercooked and slimy or overlooked and dry. The wait staff tells me this is one of the biggest complaints they get.  Unfortunately after years of complaints management can't seen to get it right.\n\nLook elsewhere if you want good quality Chicken Wings (Wingstop #1, Buffalo Wild Wings #2) or any other Native New Yorker."

0,"If I was rating for the food I would give a 4 however having been there twice over the past year - and with no plans to go back - because of the staff. \n\nThere is almost no eye contact, never a smile and you feel as if they think they are doing you a favour. It makes for a very uncomfortable meal even though the food is good. After the first time we made the excuse that perhaps they were having an off day however when it happened again we realised it is their default postion."

0,"We ordered two salads this morning and the waitress snarled at us, took our menus and through them on the front desk behind her.  Apparently the waitresses have to make the salads. At one point she told the table next to us when they were not ready, that she would be back then as I have to go make salads.  Based on this experience I will never make another cross country flight to KMSN nor would I recommend anyone go out of their way to only to be treated so poorly."

1,"WOW!  What an awesome concept!  World of Beer is a fantastic place for us beer snobs.  Located right on South Blvd and Bland street.  There is street parking or there are spots if you turn onto Bland off South, in the parking garage behind WOB.\n\nThe interior is inviting with a very long bar, high-tops and low tops.  TONS of tvs to watch the game.  There is also a small patio with comfy seating outside too.\n\nThere are two menus - one of drafts and one of bottles.  The menus are organized by beer type!  Genius!  \n\nWe stopped by here yesterday and grabbed a table outside.  Folks had their doggies runnin around - it was so relaxing and chill!\n\nI had a great half and half ($6 bucks) - perfectly poured.  If you get hungry there is food available for delivery - see the spiral menu in the back.\n\nThe one complaint was that one of my friend's drinks was not charged properly when she got the bill.  Once she pointed it out to the waitress however, it was taken care of right away.\n\nWe will definitely be back!!!  :-D"
0,Don't ever more to this place!!!! They have major bug problems! Spider infestation!!! And right by the airport and right by a train so u can always hear both! Also right next to sunset park so there's always a lot of homeless!!!! My apartment got robbed!!! There was like 10 other robberies and they never got security! U think they would! It will be a huge mistake moving to that sht hole.

1,"Don Pancho grills their carne asada over charcoal. Need I say anything else? Yes I do.\n\nEverything is prepared to order. It comes out hot and delicious. \n\nThe restaurant may seem older, BUT it is kept very, very clean and tidy. The owners are very kind and enjoy talking to their customers. \n\nThey offer you complimentary chips topped with frijoles and white queso fresco. The frijoles are silky smooth and savory. The chipotle salsa is unbelievably good. Deliciousness all around!\n\nItems my family and I ordered:\n- Chimichanga w/ Red Chilli Beef - spicy, hot deliciousness. Not too spicy, but Br prepared to fill your drink cup frequently. An overall great item. \n\n- 3 Carne asada taco plate - these are smaller street-style tacos. The carne asada is well-seasoned, smokey, and tender. It comes with a wedge of grilled onions which adds a great depth of flavorful. - Carnitas quesadilla - crispy tortilla, not too cheesy, and the carnitas are crispy and flavorful. \n\n- Birria - I'd come here solely for the birria, which is only served on certain days. The broth has great depth of flavor from the many spices, and when you add the lime and onions, gets even better. The meat is fall off the bone tender. \n\n- Carne asada burrito plate - The burrito only contains rice, asada, and some onions. That is all that it needs anyways. As stated before, the asada is awesome! The rice has great flavor, and the frijoles is well seasoned and creamy in texture. \n\n- Tripa taco - Worth trying. Crispy, clean taste with no bitterness. Great option to the asada. \n\n- Cabeza taco - Very good. Tender and moist. It tastes like stewed ox tail.\n\n- Lengua taco - another great option if you want to try it. Very, very delicious. \n\nYou won't go wrong with anything on the menu. Be adventurous, try anything and everything. \n\nI am definitely going to be a repeat customer, and will be recommending my friends to come here."
0,"I don't like leaving negative feedback for anyone and always try to give the benefit of the doubt.  I understand it's a busy time but there is no excuse for bad manners.  That being said... Worst customer service ever!  Over they years I've used many different car service companies for business travel and this one has the worst service.  I was booking travel for a week out for my boss and submitted a request online; 24 hours later still hadn't heard a peep from them.  Next day I called to make sure they had received the request and get a confirmation number.  They guy basically told be he'd get to when he'd get to me and that there was time.  I gave him the benefit of the doubt and waited for a return call... nothing.  One and half days later  (today) I call again. I needed a confirmation number for my boss who was leaving this afternoon for other portions of his travel.  The same guy basically yelled at me and said he'd get back to me.  I tried to tell him I need the number today due to other travel.  Finally I just said \""Forget it, if your customer service is this bad I don't want to use you.\""  He could have politely said he's super busy but promised to get back to me.  If this company can't return a phone call in a deceit time frame, how can I rely on them to actually be reliable for a pickup? Not to mention that I wasn't even sure they could accommodate my request.  To bad for him... I work for a CEO of a major company and my boss will be traveling to Phoenix a lot over the next year and beyond.  He just lost a big chunk of change."
0,"Meh. I've tried True Food Kitchen twice now and both times have been quite underwhelming. Not anything terrible, just bland, and boring. I had the panang curry with shrimp, and the boyfriend had the chicken sausage pizza. My curry was more like yellow curry with a lot less flavor. And the potatoes were kind of crunchy, too. Pizza was fine, nothing special. \n\nThe first time I went (for take out) I got the shaved turkey sandwich which was pretty much flavorless.\n\nEven writing this review is making me feel flavorless and boring. Sorry guys. \n\nI am really torn between 2 and 3 stars, because our server was so amicable, and our drinks were good (albeit reaaaally slow). But overall I have a much more 2-star feeling about this place. Meh."
1,"good food and portion size with good prices.  Only reason I give 4 instead of 5 stars is the ambiance of the restaurant - a little outdated for decor, not a place I would typically bring people visiting."
0,"What a disappointment of staying at #bellagio ! Thought this will be the most famous hotel in Vegas, it turns out to be the worst experience! The hotel room sucks and small, with the same price but lower, we got a way better room and view in #cosmopolation next door. Yet, the service is really really bad! We call and ask if we will have somewhere to microwave our food and can if we get folks and spoons, then I was being transferred from front desk to room service to dinning service, by the end we have been told that we need to pay for the folks and spoons! Last but not least, everything in the room is charged for money, no free water nothing is free expect the wifi, oh wait! We actually pay 28$ for wifi which is included in the resort fee! #theterribleexperienceever"
0,"US Airways has to be the most god awful airline to fly with. Forget checking in any bags if you want to save money, because they with charge you an arm and a leg if you have extra. Every time I have flown with them my flight is usually delayed due to some mechanical issue, I know big fun right? Their flight attendants are not my favorite either, they usually have some sort of bossy attitude on top of being a little lazy. I do not recommend this airline to anyone."
1,"Always have a good experience every time I get my hair cut here. They also send out coupons, making their service even more affordable. I love the online checkin option, allows me to know when to show up- I don't think I have ever waited more than 2 mins. I definitely recommend them !"
0,"We used to love coming to this place. Their food is super yummy! BUT eating out at a restaurant is partly so we can be served rather than serving ourselves at home. Today, the only time we saw our server was when she took our order and delivered it. My boyfriends water cup was empty from halfway through the meal til we left.. we never saw her and wasn't even there to deliver our check. We had to ask one of the other servers ourselves! What made it worse was that the server checked on the tables around us but our table!\n\nNot coming back to this place again :( I would rather go to the original location or boiling crab"

1,"Staying in town with some friends and read a few reviews on Helen's. Decided to try it and from the moment we walked in, I felt like I had been coming in for years. Lupe the hostess was so nice and told us everything about the menu and even gave advice about where to watch the Bronco game while in town. \nNow about the food, Orange juice was big enough to serve 3 people and at iHop this would have been 12 - 15 $$$. The portions are big enough to share and they will let you replace pancakes for toast and biscuits and gravy etc.. Anything we asked for was perfectly fine with them and made quick work of it. If you live here or are in town, stop at this pace because it's worth it! It's not fancy so if your looking for 5 star hotel food with oatmeal at $14 bucks a bowl, this is not your place. If you're looking for a killer comfort breakfast place with super nice people and killer prices, this is it! \nEnjoy."
0,This location is CLOSED. It's an empty building.\n\nI am only putting one star up because I have to in order to post.
0,I took a group of 12 friends there based on the recommendation of a friend.... It was some of the blandest Thai food I have ever had. \n\nThe Panag Nua was tough and lacking in flavor. It was a true Panag curry but it just seemed watered down. The meat had been just sliced and tossed in. Normally good Thai places have nice chunks of beef that they let stew in it all day so the sauce permeates it and the meat just falls apart. \n\nThe Yum Yai salad had almost no sauce and what litte sauce it did have lacked in any flavor.\n\nThe Tom Ka Guy soup was watery and heavily lacking in taste. The chicken in it was dry and huge chunks that were just not right for a soup. It also lacked a decent amount of mushrooms.\n\nThe Kow Pat Moo was totally flavorless for a Thai fried rice. It was more like over priced panda express Chinese fast food rice.  This is a huge failure. I mean how hard is it to toss nam plaud and sugar into some rice? \n\nThe Phad Thai was soggy and had more the consistency of spagetti with marinara then a thai fried noodle dish. \n\nThe saving grace was the moo sautee. It was nice and small like you would get on the streets of bangkok. It did taste good but then again that's the staple of Thai places and you would have to go out of your way to screw this one up.\n\nAll this being said my friends liked it BUT none of them have ever tried Thai food before much less GOOD Thai food. I think this must be the case for a lot of the positive reviews here. An other negative reviewer pointed out that there simply no Thai people in there this does tend to be a good indicator as to if a Thai place is good.
0,"One of my favorite places because they host so many events that I enjoy.\n\nBarrett Jackson Auto Auction\nArabian Horse Show\nParada Del Sol Rodeo\nGood Guys Car Show\n\nHowever, it's not an ideal place for large events.  The parking is atrocious.  Anybody who's made the trek to one of these events knows what I'm talking about.  The lots are dusty, dirt lots and oftentimes there's no organization in the lots....you're left to fend for yourself where to park.  Plus the walk to/from the parking lots is far.\n\nAlso, traffic flow is awful.  You have to dodge cars between ropes with flags that delineate the lanes of traffic and pedestrian walkways....not really safe.\n\nThe bathroom situation here is really bad too.  There are too few permanent restroom facilities.  Certainly not enough to accommodate the huge events they host here.  The restrooms are like the public park restrooms you see around town....small, concrete structures with a handful of stalls.  Instead, you have to use port-a-potty's....which are nasty.\n\nOverall, there are some great events here and in my opinion, the city should put some money into making this a top notch facility for attendees of these events.  However, I just read an article in AZ Central that said Westworld will lose $3 mil in 2014, so I'm not sure any of this is possible.\nhttp://www.azcentral.com/community/scottsdale/articles/20130125audit-westworld-faces-million-deficit.html\n\nReturn Factor - 100% (because I enjoy the events that much)"
0,"2 stars for having a clean salon and my nail tech was really nice. Well, it was her first day at that location, so I think she had to make a good impression on her new bosses. She was nice, but my nails ended up thick and my gels chipped in a day (grrr).\n\nMissing stars for stupid charges. I went to replace the polish on my gel manicure. Now, every other salon in town DOES NOT charge you for gel soak off if you are getting gels again! Oh no, this salon will advertise \""$23\"" gel manicure and throw in $5 soak off if you currently have gels. Really stupid! Sure I understand if I was getting a regular manicure instead, the soak off charge would be legitimate, I almost feel like it's borderline \""bait and switch\"" ! I wanted to say something, and inquire as to why the ridiculous charge, but didn't want my mini spa day to put me in a bad mood. Well, it did anyway because I left there feeling overcharged and unappreciated. \n\nI would avoid this place if at all possible. There are a few more salons within a one mile radius, give them your business."

0,"I had previously reviewed the MGM Grand in Las Vegas and gave it four stars. Well, after staying there for five nights and experiencing all the bullshit we went through, it got dropped down to two stars. And that's ONLY because the staff there was friendly.\n\nSo we lock in the rate of $50 per night in February to travel in May. We book a king bed. When we get there--\""we're all out of king beds, we can upgrade you into the west wing for no charge. But a lot of people don't like the west wing, so if you don't like it, we can move you guys tomorrow.\"" Okay fine, we go to the west wing..even though I've been told by many people the West Wing rooms are shitty. So we get to the room, it's a dingy piece of crap. You walk in and literally walk right into the bathroom. Plus the room is SMALL!  \n\nSo the next day, we call the front desk. They say we can move between 2 and 4pm. So I check back at 2 they tell me to check back at 3:30. I call back at 3:30, \""okay we can move you to a king room (WHICH IS WHAT WE ORIGINALLY RESERVED!)--however it will be an hour before a bellhop can get your bags.\"" Are you f'ing kidding me!??! An hour!!?? Christ, I know the hotel is big, but still! We wound up carrying our bags from the West Wing to the front desk. Anyone who has stayed there knows that's a long freaking walk!  We complained to the front desk and told them at this point, we'd rather be staying at South Point (where we usually stay.) They got a manager and upgraded us to a suite.\n\nSo we get to the new room, turn the A/C on full blast and head out for our anniversary dinner at the fabulous T-Bones Steak House in Red Rock (read my review for that!)  We get back to the room around 11:00pm and it feels like we walked into a goddamn sauna! I call the front desk to let them know our A/C is not working. Okay,  we'll have someone right up. Couldn't give me a time frame. So now it's midnight, we're both tired so we call back and tell them to forget about it. Unbelievable. The A/C works, but it worked half-assed. The TV sucked as well, they're not HD TV's and the picture was very fuzzy. Also, our room safe was competely useless since the battery on it was low, so we couldn't use it. We also had no Do Not Disturb thing for the door, so I made one myself. If I called the front desk to ask for any of these things to be fixed, I'd probably be still waiting.\n\nOh it gets better. The kicker was the next night when we get into the elevator. There are like four people on the elevator, we are on the 11th floor. The four other people get off at 6. The elevator goes to 10 and then DROPS two floors. My wife and I had our lives flashing before our eyes. The elevator made a creaking noise and just dropped! Reminded me of the old Edge at Six Flags Great America.\n\nWe went to the Rainforest Cafe here one night, it was ok, nothing special. The lines for the breakfast and dinner buffets were absolutely ridiculous. We waited over 30 minutes for breakfast on a Tuesday morning and over 45 minutes for dinner on a Monday night. On Friday, we went to the Rio Buffet (The best I've ever had, again read my review for that) and waited all of 2 MINUTES. Take that! \n\nAgain, I only gave this place two stars because the employees are very friendly especially the dealers in the poker room. Stay away from here. Go to South Point instead."

As soon as you involve customer service or management you can kiss any hope of resolution good-bye. They are unprofessional, to the point of almost being illiterately so, I mean just dumb people. And I want to apologize in advance to illiterate people, no offense to you.\n\nAfter my first review they came back to my house. I had just come in from out of town and they had some deal with their kid and couldn't make it. So, they took it upon themselves to reschedule. When they came back they were obviously in a hurry and did a slop job. Complained, rewrote my review, had management harass me to change my review, sent them out again, finally got my floors clean. Okay, done.\n\nWent to reschedule to have them come out and clean again. They apparently took me off the monthly schedule I was on without me knowing. Called in, told the woman to make sure maids knew the door would be open for the next cleaning, I would not be there. Maids come over, knock and knock, call, text message. I'm in a meeting I can't get out of to take any calls, or return texts so they leave. No cleaning. I call in, they say they saw that for the NEXT appointment I had. I didn't even know I had a next appointment. So, rescheduled for the next day. THEY NEVER SHOWED UP.\n\nCalled back up and talked to another illiterate person who put me on hold to answer another call. Uh, okay. Came back and said she'd check it out and call me back. NEVER CALLED BACK.\n\nI called for two days straight at varying times of day and THEY NEVER ANSWERED THE PHONE.\n\nThis company is crap. Seriously. If you have no problems you're probably fine, but the second you have one you have just encountered the Keystone Cops. Bumbling, lying, rude, ignorant people where you are sure to get no resolution.\n\nI can assure you as an avid reviewer, a conscientious consumer, a person who expects great customer service: this company only cares about good reviews. You are persona non grata if you have problems. STAY AWAY, there are a million good cleaners in Vegas, this is NOT one of them."

0,"Horrible experience! Attitude and cruel. Disabled and woman of maturity, never in my years had a company move me with contempt seething through argumentative and disrespectful lips. I warn and please beware! Charles was the man in charge and the purpose for the words I write. I am so upset after the discriminating and hurtful experience. The boxes were packed and had been shipped fom WI. The few items not bedbug items contained were to be boxed in 2 wardrobes bought from them. Despite all, the bashing continued. I cut the job only half performed to get them and negativity away. My back was on fire after lifting n packing. I am disabled w spine degeneration disease and a senior and he crossed so many lines of discrimination, customer care, and common decency and respect. Hired C2moving (5) to complete the job.

0,"This Walmart is the worse Walmart I have gone to & I've been at different locations throughout the city. I tried to return my bfs cable cord & Jamie asked why I didn't want it & I said it doesn't work with our game box. I honestly didn't know what to say because it wasnt mine in the first place then an old white man decided to jump in my convo & tell her that it works. Who asked you in the first place? My bf  Mentioned a cable man giving us a cord to go with our Internet so why can't we return our extra item? I don't know why he was in my business anyway... He didn't pay for it. Asshole. So, Jamie proceeds to check my item THOROUGHLY.. Says that I have to grab another one all the way in electronics which was at the back of the store. Really?! You can't call one of your other employees? What kind of customer service is this? I'm pretty sure if the asshole who jumped in my convo didn't say anything she wouldn't have made me walk all the way across the store when I had my receipt and everything attached anyway. Plus, I asked the manager of CS.. some black woman where it was and she said Electronics.. Didn't bother to point or direct where it was... I don't know what kind of customer service Walmart gives... But then again... Look at the other reviews on this location."

By 12:30 we were dead tired.\n\nEveryone always talks about the stairs... yes for ladies if  your wearing heals it is a pain but we stayed on the main floor so none of our girls complained. The EDM floor had plenty of room because it opened to the outside so not to much problem with crowding.\n\nThe drink prices are vegas prices so no surprise there. Now back to arriving early. We started the party waaaay to early! One of our friends drank a little to much and we had to take care of her.  She was climbing on stuff and laying down so the bouncers got kind of mad but you can't blame them. by 12:30 we left....We didn't get to see Chuckie.

You lay on a recliner that is on a raised platform and your lash person works behind you. It is peaceful and relaxing.\n\nIt is often difficult to get an appointment so book in advance. They charge you $9 when you book and the balance at appointment time,"
1,"I didn't try the food, so that is the only things holding back another star.  Went there for girls night out and had a blast.  The band was amazing, crowd was fun, staff was attentive.  It was just a great night!  I would recommend."
0,"$19 for an over-cooked and virtually tasteless burger. The menu describes it as some type of exotic beef. I've had far better for $7.00 at Alphys in Arroyo Grande. Might have been better if the waitress - Monique - had actually cared. When I pointed it out, she huffed and said, \""what would you like me to do, take it back?\""\n\nCan't remember the last time I left a ZERO tip. Poor food is not the fault of the server. In this case the food was only exceeded in its poor quality by the server's attitude. \n\nAnd to continue the rant - it takes a ton of attitude for a restaurant to think its food is so tasty that they don't need to put salt & pepper shakers on the table. The chef at Cowboy Ciao must think his poop doesn't smell - but he's wrong.\n\nI travel for business 10-15 days a month - eat in airports nearly every day I'm on the road. Cowboy Ciao is right up at the top of my worst experience list."
1,"I've been going back to Peter's yard after a year or so of abandonment (this was due to work being so far away but now I'm back over the road) \n\nGoing to do this in Pro - Con form (I'll likely have more pros than cons so this may get a bit interesting towards the bottom)\n\nPRO - The flat White is AMAZING, as is the cappuccino  \nCON - There is usually a pretty HUGE queue and it can be tough to find somewhere to sit.\n\nPRO - The food is delicious and filling and YUM YUM YUM. Breakfasts are really good. \nCON - It is admittedly also quite expensive. This is ok sometimes but occasionally I felt a little short changed. \n\nPRO - It's an amazing building that feels airy, bright, sunny, magic and warm\nCON - Because of this it's REALLY busy sometimes and can be hard to find a seat as already mentioned. They also have NO WIFI (sin)\n\nPRO - They do really good pots of tea that are excellent value for money and do do takeaway coffee\nCON - They took away the honesty box for takeaway coffee because tramps kept stealing it - This means you have to queue for it and that takes ages - defeating the point of it being a \""quick\"" option.\n\nPRO - It's independently owned and I love it because they are doing something different and interesting and creating a strong brand.\nCON - I find it really hard to find nice fitting trousers in most high street shops now a days. usually no bum/legs are too tight. WHAT SHAPE ARE MOST MEN NOW FFS?\n\nPRO - The outdoors bit is really good. Lots of space - good sun in the morning.\nCON - I hate that there are cash machines in some places that charge you to use them. It really really annoys me. The ONLY one at Aberdeen Central Station charges you \u00a31.50 - can you believe that?\n\nPRO - It's a lovely place to sit and read a book/tether your laptop to your phone and work.\nCON - I imagine it wouldn't be a great place to be in an earthquake.\n\nSo overall. Amazing stuff. I recommend checking it out and eating crispbread and cheers MMMMMMmmmmmmmMMMMMMMMM"
1,"Wow. Okay- I wrote my first review about this brewery years ago. Here is my amazing update:\n\n1. This is seriously one of my favorite places in Charlotte. I am greeted with such happy people whenever we swing by. \n2. My amazing Chihuahua, Bruce, is adored as much as he should be. They recognize his greatness. That, obviously, makes me thrilled (check by the register for a small portrait of Bruce!)\n3. REMEMBER HOW I COMPLAINED ABOUT PARKING? That was dumb of me. There is so much parking now.\n4. REMEMBER HOW I COMPLAINED ABOUT FOOD? That was dumb of me. This places almost always has a food truck. Seriously- if you want food- there is usually food.\n5. The beer is still incredible. They are passionate about brewing a good beer and they are successful at it.\n6. COMMUNITY- they are always involved in something with the community. Sometimes it is art. Sometimes it is NoDa related. Sometimes it is to help people. But they are always doing something by either creating a community space or giving back. I'm a social worker and a sucker for that."
0,"Very bad experience...be careful. While the newly remodeled hotel looked nice and didnt smell like smoke...we waited 4 hours for our room to become available. Good thing we arrived on Friday for our Saturday wedding. Some of our other guests, including my folks were not so lucky. They had to arrive on Saturday due to work schedules...also waited for 3+ hours for their room for a wedding that was to begin at 6PM. Just as my niece was about to use the lobby bathroom to get ready...my parents room became available. It all worked out.....but God forbid you complain about it.....they offered us $100 in free food which lasted 15 seconds...lol....so when we tried to complain, we were reminded several times that we were compensated.\nWe will NOT return or recommend that hotel.....with that type of customer service, they do not deserve to be in business!"
0,"Stairs are a joke: Walking the stairs is fine.  Walking behind some slow moving drunk girls is not.  Especially when the hallway is so narrow and they look like they're learning to walk in heels for the first time.  It seemed like all the smart girls brought extra flip flops with them in their purses.\n\nCrowd is a joke: It's only been open for 6 months, but it already looks like AZN night at a club in Hollywood (see Saturdays at Exchange LA).  The crowd is NOT good looking.  I'm not the handsomest devil myself, but when you're in Vegas and you put a little effort into how you look, you can get a pass.  Half the people looked like they weren't even trying. \n\nMusic and venue were pretty awesome, but let's face it.  When you're in Vegas, you're looking for a good vibing good looking crowd, which was lacking at Marquee (though it certainly wasn't when it first opened). 1 star for the outdoor/pool patio.  Reminds me of Pure before it went to s**t.\n\nThe architects did a great job in terms of keeping people inside and not going back to their rooms to restock on alcohol and other things, because this place is impossible to get in and out of.  \n\nSecond shining star: Experienced a friendly staff (bouncers/doormen) for the first time at a Vegas club when not buying a table.  \n\nI'd go again only if my friends were dying to check it out, but never on my own accord."
0,"I am bewildered by Seksun's good or even decent reviews. It was right around the corner from where I was, so I came here for lunch. I ate the sushi off the conveyer belt (though there was only rolls, edamame, and desert on it) but I didn't enjoy it. The rolls come around with only three pieces, which would have been nice because I could have tried several things, if there had been any variety of sushi or if it had been edible. I tried the Flash Star Roll, and it just tasted off. Then I tried a Spicy Tuna Roll but I couldn't even finish it due to the fishy flavor. The rice was also very gummy. In the end, I thought I would be safe with the edamame, but even that tasted like it had sat around for ages. I immediately got the check and left hungry. The server was prompt with my bill, but I was one of only two tables in the restaurant that was occupied. My bill was less than $7 but I would never come back here considering the other and far better sushi options in Chandler."
0,"Saw W&W last Monday using my free vCard pass. It was an ok club. The wait to get in wasn't too long, but we were in the VIP line. \n\nThe drinks were expensive and weak, which was expected because its Vegas. The type of people there were mixed, but I did notice a lot more older people than I thought there would be (like people pushing 50). \n\nMy main problem was that their main dance floor was small. At one point, they weren't letting people go on the main dance floor because it was overcrowded, which was disappointing because I came there to dance, not to stand around with my overpriced drink. \n\nWe left right when W&W were done because there was simply nothing that excited us about this club. Very over-hyped for sure. Don't pay full price and try to get on a guest list because its not worth paying that much money."
1,"Great show. Very good seating. Amazing stunts and diving. I liked better than \""O\"" (my wife thinks the opposite. Make sure you leave time for walking the casino it is great."
1,This place is very friendly and relaxing. I've been getting my lashes done by Emma since April and she's the best! I've had my lashes done in the past at different salons and was not satisfied.  Highly recommended!
1,"Great relaxed downtempo atmosphere.  Hip and classy while casual and unpretentious.  Impressive selection of beers, but nothing local.\n\n\""Blasted brussels sprouts w/ arrugula pesto\"" sounds great, but were too bitter, hard, and oily.\n\n\""Pesto brie french fries\"" were fabulous, but needs more pesto and Brie (and less oil) for a plate of fries that huge.  This is NOT a small side plate."
0,"I moved here from LA so I know my sushi, apparently unlike the other reviewers of Goyemon. Many classmates had recommended this place but it was more than a disappointment. The eel must have been a week old. The food smelled and had zero sauce. My rolls stuck to the plate they were so dry. We got AYCE and were lost as to what to order because the food was just so bad. Literally, I've had better sushi in a mall food court. Zero stars!!!\nBest sushi in Vegas is Sushi Twister in Henderson."
1,"This is a long overdue review, but after having attempted to slow grill my own ribs over weekend, I decided I needed to show appreciation for one of the masters in town.\n\nWhen I first noticed the funky little box of a building on Indian School a little over a year ago, I wasn't sure what it was, let alone what to expect.  After walking in to the no-frills and being ignored for a bit, I was ready to walk out.  I'm glad I changed my mind.\n\nYes the service can be a bit slow and some times appear surely, and the decor is bare bones... but this is because they are dedicated to putting all their energy into producing the finest bbq this side of the Kansas. One can imagine places like this spread out through along the highways and small towns in the mid-west and southern states, packed with BBQ loving locals.  Once you get to the counter and get down to the business of placing your order, the service is extremely friendly and helpful (especially for a Canadian transplant, who didn't know the first thing about real BBQ culture)\n\nAfter getting my order home, all I could say is FAN-TAS-TIC. Smoky, tender pork ribs slathered in an amazing barbecue sauce --  sweet, with a deep yet subtle 'tang'. Frankly, I don't remember what sides I ordered, as i was lost in the meat, saucy goodness.\n\nOverall, a great experience, and while I've yet to return, I will be back one of these days.  After having tried Stacy's, all I can say is I'm a BBQ convert.  Since that fateful day, I've been busy checking out other BBQ joints as well as perfecting my own sauces and techniques (which has given me a deeper appreciation for the mastery of what Stacey and his staff do).  I'll be back."
1,"The Curve is a Madison gem! I would call this place a diamond in the rough because you can't simply judge based on appearances. Once inside, you will experience the greatness of true American diner food. Do not expect a frou-frou breakfast or lunch but instead an excellent but basic American menu. This diner serves hands down the best French toast I have ever tasted! If you enjoy poached eggs, make sure to come before 9AM; otherwise you will have to get them basted (just as delicious). I would also recommend their omelettes, especially for you Wisco chedder lovers. Keep an eye out for their home-made corned beef hash as a special on the weekend. I wish this were offered more consistently but totally worth ordering if on special  Do not order corned beef hash during the week though because it's not home-made and probably from a can. If you're craving lunch, the burgers are a must! I would rate this place in the top 5 for Madison's best cheeseburgers. This place is perfect for those who are looking for their regular, weekly diner. Bring Cash!"
0,"I feel like Will Ferrell in Elf on seeing the sign for World's Best Cup of Coffee: \""You did it! Congratulations! World's best cup of coffee! Great job, everybody!\""\n\nAnd really, the Voted Best Sandwich in America sign is just like that.\n\nIt wasn't busy, but the girl at the counter seemed to be struggling. I overheard someone ask her what goes in a salad and her answer was \""I don't know, salads aren't my thing.\"" Then I watched her incorrectly ring up the man in front of me, who politely pointed out she was overcharging him. Eek.\n\nI got the turkey sub, which isn't your typical deli sliced turkey, but more like the stuff you have after Thanksgiving. I like it in concept, but it had a funny sweet flavor that wasn't working for me. The toppings on the sub were nothing special, and overall my sandwich didn't have much filling or flavor. I was eating at home, so I dressed it up myself.\n\nThe two stars come from the shop being tidy and the speedy service."
0,"I love Paradise Bakery and have always had a great experience at this location, but not today.   The employee that helped us was clueless (later found out it was her first day...and believe me, it showed)...it took her entirely too long to locate the sandwiches on her order form that we were trying to order.   She served me chicken noodle soup that was broth only...sorry, we paid $10 for 2 soups and would like more than broth.  I discussed the situation with the employee that delivered our new soup and he only gave me the excuse of her being new = fail!  Make sure your employees are fully trained and representative of your brand even on your first day...it will go a long way!"
0,"I came here on August 31st, my husband ordered three tacos, and we decided to eat there. There was no one else in the joint, and we waited about 5 minutes. The tacos came, and my husband tells me he ordered them soft, so I told him I would go and return them. I told the girl who was working and she said \""he didn't say soft\"" I was taken aback so I told her if that was the case I would pay extra for giving us soft tacos. I think I was very nice. She then says \"" if I do that, I'll throw those ones out\"" so I say \"" so I'm stuck with these.\"" Which she turns around and starts talking with her crew.  What makes this worse is I contacted the company with no response. It's one thing to have a rude crew, it's another for a company not to care. Terrible, I should of read all the reviews first."
1,"Banger is no less than 5 star on every single visit. They create some phenomenal brew, have excellent customer service, are dog friendly AND non-smoking. How can they get any less than perfect ratings? \n\nEveryone here rocks. From the guys at the door checking id's, the bartenders who know their shit, to the owners giving tours, brewing beer and making sure everything is running smoothly, every single person I have encountered is a rockstar. \n\nThey run lots of cool promotions that are definitely worth checking out. Happy hour runs Monday to Friday, 3-6 and features $5 pints. The brew here is WELL worth the $6-$8 price tag, but $5? Yes please! Sign me up for that. They have Banger Bingo on the first Wednesday of every month, periodically they have a \""pints and paws\"" fundraiser and every Tuesday (my personal favorite) is 2 for 1 growler refills. \n\nCheck this place out. Drink local. Drink Hop Bang Boom. Breath smoke free air. Eat dill pickle popcorn. Play Bingo. Bring your dog. Just get down here."
0,"We were there between lunch and dinner, around two or so.  We wanted to eat in the regular dining room that had a menu but there were no seats. We were forced to eat in the larger dining room that had the all you can eat food.  Expecting some kind of buffet, I was disappointed when we were served a platter with greasy beef ribs with too much barbeque sauce, two pieces of dry ham and cold greasy chicken.  The beans were good and the cole slaw was OK.  I would definitely not go back."
1,Came in for dinner a few nights ago.  Service was really fast.  Food was fresh and delicious.  Like other reviews say the sauce is unreal recommend asking for some extra on the side.  I got their gyro combo and will back soon for another.
1,"We had a good meal.\n1. We walked up without a reservation (=never happen in NY)\n2. Pasta was cooked flawlessly. Flavors were balanced. Portion sizes were \""very healthy\"" (and not small)\n3. Service was timely, attentive given how busy they were. Nice staff.\n4. Priced appropriately. Given that there are other places that charge several hundred bucks a person on the strip, Rao's pricing is commensurate with the food service/quality. Consistency is key."
0,"A lovely idea for a business and I was looking forward to trying this place when it opened last year. However, when I went along and tried some of the beers on offer, I was totally shocked at the prices being charged. Prices vary from around \u00a36 to nearly \u00a310 for a litre of beer! That is way more expensive than pub prices (as an average), so I fail to see how this business can be a success going forward. Yes, I understand that dealing in small batches of beer and regularly changing the beers on offer, will add cost but if you get yourself to somewhere like Stewart Brewing at Loanhead you get draught beer to take away in bottles, in exactly the same way as Growler Beers of Morningside but Stewart's are around half the price with draft beer ranging from around \u00a33.80 to less than \u00a35. There can be no justification for this kind of extra cost being charged by Growler Beers and I think the owner needs to rethink his strategy, as every time I pass the shop, it is empty. It looks like the high prices are keeping the punters away! Oh and by the way, Stewart Brewing do some excellent beers!"
0,"I'm not sure what happened to this place, but over the last 6 months it has taken several steps in the wrong direction. The quality of the food is the only reason this is a two start review, and not a one star. The service is getting slower every visit, and the pricing fluctuations are ridiculous. The once $.99 breakfast biscuits are now $2.99. Two hundred percent increase in less than 6 months!"
1,"We are originally from Chicago and are hot dog people so we were excited to try a hot dog dive.  We had 3 different specialty dogs with locavore's, The Chicago, Mexican, and Italian.  All were great even though I was disappointed that there wasn't an open fire charring the hot dogs.  The Chicago was close and the other two were very good except that they were out of guacamole for the mexican.  I would definitely go back if I can get downtown during mid-day."
0,"Didn't think I'd be reviewing a McDonald's like most people have been saying on here, but I'm finally annoyed enough to write. First off, I walk in and there's a guy texting on his phone behind the front counter and behind the shift lead. If this Corporate location is attempting to make McDonald's look more upscale and professional, then the employees should be the part as well. Texting in front of customers is unacceptable, whether on break or not. If you're on break, you should be using your cell phone in a non-public area, out of view of guests. Second, the shift lead that took my order rang up the wrong special order on my Crispy Chicken Classic because she was distracted by engaging in conversation with co-workers... which should stop completely when a guest is present. I think this location lacks accountability of its employees, and soon, it will become a free-for-all if a stop isn't put to it."
0,"Too expensive on most products. Example: new release of AC/DC's Rock or Bust, $16.99. At Walmart, $9.99. I used to enjoy going to Best Buy, but they have changed their store's into something I don't recognize anymore."
0,"Crust takes almost exactly like cardboard and the toppings are icky.  I can't imagine why anyone would order from here.\n\nAlthough I did make a second order from here one time - New Year's Eve in fact - but that was only because the cab we had booked never showed up to bring us back home from downtown.  So, I walked here, ordered a pizza to be delivered to my house, then tried to make the delivery guy drive me AND the pizza.  Pretty smart, huh?  Too bad they wouldn't let me though.  So I canceled the ordered and kept on walking.  And walking.  And walking.  It's a long way to east Urbana from downtown Champaign.  In the cold.  On New Year's Eve."
1,"Decided to go to this place since i drive by it 10 times a week and i must say,  WOW,,,  very good burgers..  I have found my new favorite burger joint,,  move over In & Out,, you've been benched..  They use fresh ingredients and you can tell..  I did'nt give them 5 stars because i've gotta hold out for the perfect burger although it may not exist... I just wish there was more than 1 location.."
1,"Got the Feast for 2. Very good! The hot link was awesome, the St. Louis ribs were also good! I would like to try more of the menu! Service was great, nice atmosphere."
0,"I came here with my girlfriend on a Tuesday evening and I honestly never even knew this restaurant existed. We had found a groupon which was $65 all you can eat surf and turf + salad bar, plus 2 cocktails and 1 dessert. First off, it says $65, but after tipping (we tipped according to how much it would have been without the deal) it cost us about $95 total. It still isn't a bad deal because I think our total would have been about $140 (not including tax or tip) anyways if we didn't have the groupon.\n\nIt was pretty busy when we got there so that was a good sign I guess. The waiter was very attentive and showed us the details of our deal and what we got. I was thinking that we get two free cocktails regardless of what they were, but actually there is a list of 4 to choose from. This includes a mojito, 2 brazilian cocktails, or a margarita. My girlfriend chose the margarita and I chose the mojito. I feel like the mojito barely had any alcohol in it, but the margarita was super strong haha.\n\nThe salad bar isn't really that big compared to Via Brasil and Texas De Brazil. Regardless, I enjoyed the roasted mushrooms, pasta salad, beets, and cheese bread (amazing, might I add). I know my girlfriend loved the mashed potatoes and the cheese bread too.\n\nOk, now the meat and seafood. The shrimp isn't peeled, which really bothers me for some reason. They do taste good though after you peel them and whatnot. The mahi mahi didn't taste right to me, and the salmon was OK - nothing too amazing about it. I think the best of the meats were the bacon wrapped filet mignon, bacon wrapped chicken, beef tenderloin and spicy sausage. My girlfriend really REALLY liked the bacon wrapped chicken though haha.\n\nFor dessert we had the Tiramisu which was pretty good.\n\nLast but not least, service was great and our server was on top of everything. He kept our waters filled up and was very attentive, which is a big deal for me.\n\nOverall I think this place was OK....nothing too spectacular or amazing about it. If it were up to me I'd probably just go to Via Brasil especially since it is only 5 min from my house. I don't think we'll come back to Pampas."
0,"This place has a nice concept where they charge the same price for any article you bring, I believe $2.50 so the price is nice. Where they are lacking is with their customer service I had two different times where my clothes were not ready when they were supposed to and the girl working told me to just come back, I asked if they will be ready by the next day and she said, \""tomorrow, next day, just pick your lucky day...\"" They have no idea how to treat their customer and how to handle a situation where they are at fault. I will not be going back and will be be telling everybody I know about my terrible experiences there."
1,great spot
0,"The best thing about Mac's is the beer selection.  Customer service is always a disaster.  They should forego the servers and make it self service.  We can walk up to the bar or to the food window just as well as any of their servers can and we'd probably have a better experience if we were taking care of ourselves.  \n\nOur food arrived before our drinks.  I don't know why it takes fifteen minutes to get a coke and a (screw top bottle) Yeungling.   It wasn't that busy but our server was handling tables both outside and inside which seems like a poor decision by management so I don't blame her.\n\nThe pulled pork is bland.  It was helped a little by the bottled BBQ sauce at the table but you'd think it would have flavor on its own.  And the Brunswick stew, which I used to like, has gotten watery and greasy so I won't be ordering that again.  And don't try to order anything unique, like slaw on the side or no onions.  They'll get it wrong and it takes twice as long to fix it while they look at you like it's your fault.\n\nFinal complaint is they say sandwiches come with one side but I've had to point this out to the waitress because they'll try to charge you for the sandwich and additionally for the side which is an extra $4, so watch your bill closely.  \n\nWith the number of BBQ joints in town you'd think management would care a little more about customer service but in spite of themselves they're so popular they don't seem to give a you-know-what which is just sad..."
1,"Great store, very clean and laid out well. Staff is great at helping you get dressed for any events or if you are just looking to update your closet, this is the place to go. While you are in be sure to get your makeup done downstairs and head over to the cafe for a bit of lunch. The pop overs are heavenly!"
0,"After a flying cross-country, waiting a lengthy bit for baggage at sky harbor in Phoenix, and enduring the public transportation to Zona, we arrive to find our room unavailable. Our reservation was null and void for night 1 and we were shuttled off to another hotel. Their sales team and a third party booking agency overbooks the rooms and their patrons arrive unexpectedly to be moved like cattle elsewhere. This is the second time this is happened to us. They did it to us in February 2014 and now May 2014. This is poor customer service and frankly I do not think management at this hotel can be trusted"
0,"Even though they are friendly at this location, nothing can make me give them a another star.  I order the chicken lunch special and it was terrible. First of all the box was big with only a lil inside... ok I get its going to be cheaper, but it was like I ordered a kids meal.. the piece of chicken were so small and prob equivalent to 1regular size chicken strip, what a jip!!!  The gravy taste like nothing,  really wishing I had some ranch for my dry overly breaded pieces of freezer burn chicken strips... This will surely be the last time I order for here, I will stick to their imitation ice cream when I am in the mood for a  artifical sugar high"

0,The Luxor Facade....\n\nGreat looking building architectural wise...i don't know about the inside though...wasn't to impressed. As soon as I entered to check in the time share crew mobbed me. They took up about 20 minutes of my valuable time. The front desk was not so friendly either...the lady was not interested with making us feel welcome. It was like every time i asked here a question she gave me a puzzled face very awkward...so i told myself whatever not gonna trip and proceeded to my room but then it gets worse....\n\nThe elevator fiasco....\n\nThe elevators were well hidden but i got lucky and found the right one. My luck ran out quick though....didn't know I had to use my room card to work the elevator. The front desk should give you a heads up on that one. I ended up going in and out of the elevator 2 times trying to get to my room. The 3rd time was a charm got back in the elevator and the power went out...we were trapped in pitch black for 5 minutes. We had to get into another elevator again....fighting the elevator was one thing but it gets worse again....\n\nThe Egyptian Stench....\n\nSo I finally find my room....I open the door and I get a whiff of King Tut's Grandpa. I thought I was in Motel 6....the smell was terrible. The room was so out dated...the bathroom looked better. I stuck my cellphone charger in the outlet and it fell out....the plugs were so old. This hotel needs to hire a good interior decorator seriously. The casino was kinda weak depends on your age I guess....I like loud music playing when I'm gambling....not enough restrooms so they were packed. If Luxor's management is smart they'll make some changes...if not they'll continue to be the armpit of Vegas. They won't be getting my money anytime soon...
0,"Absolutely awful. There are no Sonic's anywhere close to where I live, so when we got the chance to visit one when I went to Las Vegas, I was looking forward to it.\n\nHowever, I hate the fact that you can't walk into the place...I get it, it's a drive-in...but absolutely NO option to go inside?! Kind of silly in my opinion.\n\nGetting to the food...nothing special. I would have rather have gone to In n Out.\n\nOverall, generic experience, \""eh\"" food, and awful atmosphere. I don't recommend this place...especially if you have a hangover."
1,"When I first moved to Phoenix, I was walking around the Esplanade and saw this place.  I had lived in NYC for years and had lived on Mercer street where there was a \""Merc Bar\"" so thought I would go in and see if there was any connection.  Sure enough, this place is the 2nd location of the NYC Merc Bar.  Since I live across the street I come here fairly regularly.  I'm usually a wine or beer drinker and my only critique would be the limited selection of draft beers and very small wine list.  To their credit, their three beer tap usually has both Stella and Guinness, two of my favorites.  Nonetheless, I still have not found a wine there that I really love.  Not many people realize that they do make some excellent cheese plates if you need to snack on something.  And the bar always has both goldfish and pretzels.  If you are on a date, the really great thing is that you can grab a cozy table in the back and talk if you don't want to deal with the bar scene."
0,"I thought I was going to really impress some friends when they discovered the highly touted \""famous\"" chocolate fountain feature of our surprise Sunday brunch. \n\nAllow me to help manage YOUR expectations, so you're not as disappointed as I was: Yes, there is a chocolate fountain and it is included with your $8-13 brunch entree; but, buy your own(probably identical) model at Wal-mart for $40 and save yourself the heartache of a disappointing meal. \n\nGranted, we came for the \""famous\"" chocolate fountain but we were prepared to enjoy breakfast first! Another disappointment. \n\nI had the breakfast burrito and could only stomach the beans. The potatoes tasted like they'd been in the freezer too long. The eggs in my burrito were chewy not \""lightly\"" scrambled in the slightest.  The machaca had decent flavor but it was further ruined by the enchilada sauce that tasted straight from a generic can!\n\nOne of my guests had pancakes. Sadly, these were neither light nor fluffy, instead they were chewy and tough just like my eggs.\n\n \""The myriad of accompaniments you can serve with the chocolate fountain are only limited by your imagination\"" in theory, but at Aunt Chilada's this past Sunday, your choices were dry chunks of cantaloupe, flavorless honeydew, pineapple cubes, (shall we say \""aged\"") marshmallows, and the unimaginative standby: strawberries. Oh! And, crispy lady fingers. \n\nFull disclosure: I did not tell our server how much I hated my burrito or the pancakes and she DID ask how everything tasted. \n\nTruthfully: I was weary from the disappointment. It's one thing to send back an entree but to say everything was unsatisfactory?! I just won't recommend it or plan to return."
0,Coffee sucked ass! Bagels I took home because they were so hard I could beat the kids with them.....lol
1,"Just went here for lunch and I'm not sure how I'm writing this review because I am in a certified food coma right now. This place is the buffet version of AYCE Sushi down to the miso soup station, edamame, seaweed salad, and dessert but better because there are no limits on anything (including time;)... We started out with the fresh sushi station where sushi chefs are making sushi right in front of you while you choose your pieces and then moved our way all the way down to the hot food section. The hot food section is nothing special really. It's the sushi you come here for. Also TIP OF THE DAY: Try their iced green tea!!! Delcioussss!!!! Anyways weekday lunch is 16.95 while weekend lunch is 17.95. Weekday dinner is 26.95 while weekend dinner is 27.95. Worth it!"
1,"five out of six times, the food is good.  that sixth time, not so much.  I'll give them four stars for the effort."
1,"stopped in before a movie, had 25 minutes to eat and get out of there. Server was great he brought us everything we needed and was professional about it. Beer was nice and cold and food was above par. All said and done made it to the movie right on time."
0,"I've been here twice - with non-local friends of course who insisted to eat here. I got good health insurance and a gym membership, I'm covered. Right outside the restaurant is an old-school ambulance and a sign on top that says \""350LBS EATS FREE\"". A glutton's open invite to a free, well, heart attack. People have had heart attacks while eating here - surprise! CASH only!!!\n\nServers are dressed up as slutty nurses and the guys that work there are dressed up as doctors. Diners put on a hospital gown. If you look like you weigh about 350lbs, they'll weigh you so you can eat for free and get heavier.\n\nBurgers: single bypass, double bypass, triple bypass or quadruple bypass (one patty, 2, 3, 4 patties) cooked in lard and you have an option to add bacon. Fries are of course, cooked in lard.\n\nDrinks: soda, milkshake with butter and alcohol.\n\nBoth times I've been here, I've gotten a single bypass with bacon, fries and a water. I don't care if it's toilet water, there's no way I'm drinking butter! The patty is cooked well-done (boo!), the bread is nice and soft, and the bacon is crispy. The fries are made with real potatoes...woohoo! It's alright...\n\nWould I take anyone I love and care about here? Heck no! I'd rather bring them to one of those trendy yuppie chow places! :))"
1,Above average fried chicken and ribs delivered right to my office. I liked the potato salad and the mac n' cheese but I think everything would have been much better if eaten at the restaurant. 30-min in a foam box doesn't do this type of food any favors.
0,"Beware: The following review contains spoilers. \n\nHandy capped dude gets turned into a vampire.\n\nThat's about it.\n\nWow. Just wow. We spent the entire time that we managed to stay there trying not to burst out into laughter. \n\nThis show..well...IT BITES. It BLOWS. It SUCKS and the cherry was when we were trying to slip out of the show one of the performers walks by us and growls at us. \n\nYes. We couldn't help but start laughing then.\n\nThe only pros? Boobies. But you can see those all over Vegas, they seem to grow on trees. \n\nSave yourself the torture and just lose your money at the slots - it might be a better time."
1,"Love wine? This is the event for you.\n\nRundown of what you need to know:\n\n-This is an event that IMO the VIP is not worth it. You don't really get all that much more. Some access to a VIP tent that has some cheese and samples of a few other wines. $25-26 for general admission is a great deal to enjoy a day of sips.\n\n-Bring chairs, blankets, etc and enjoy the day. This is a day long festival and Symphony Park is a great place to spend an afternoon. There's live music, food options for purchase and some different craft type tents to explore.\n\n-Parking is free. However, it's hard to find a spot if you don't get there early. The restaurants block off their parking areas and the mall is just busy in general. This is a drinking event. Take a cab or Uber.\n\n-I know it says you can bring kids, make it a family day and what not. However, people get super drunk. Wine drunk. Holy people watching drunk.\n\n-The crowds are not very good at the whole concept of making a line to get a sample after hours of consuming wine. You're going to get a little annoyed. Good thing you brought that blanket, right?\n\n-Seriously, drunk should be in 72 pt font here.\n\nI had a good time meeting all the different vineyards and vendors. I don't know a lot about wine. I buy based on what the label looks like. So, it was good to learn a little bit along the way.\n\nJust like Beer, Bourbon and BBQ (the same people put this on), I think this is a festival that gets a little bit better each year."
1,"As a person who regularly stays at the Ritz-Carlton Phoenix, I consider 5 stars a big deal.  I stayed here, with my mom, for one night before staying 2 nights at said Ritz-Carlton, and I was upset that I didn't stay here the entire time.  The rooms at this resort far exceeded my expectations.  It's usually a timeshare type of place, so the full kitchen and separation of the bedroom was expected, but the enormous and luxurious bathroom was not.  I mean, the tub can easily fit two people AND has jets, and the shower is big enough to have a decent-sized party in!  Also, the sofa has a pull out, so the rooms are very accomadating.  This is by far the best place I've ever stayed in the Phoenix-Metro area.  I have a 3-night stay booked for the first weekend in September, and I can't wait!"
1,"I don't know what it is we East Coast-ers did, exactly, but it must have been pretty bad for us to miss out on a burger joint like In-N-Out!\n\nI blew into Scottsdale with my mother recently, and she insisted that the first thing in my mouth absolutely HAD to be an In-N-Out burger.\n\nShe wasn't wrong.\n\nI'm a little sad, thinking that I'll have to say goodbye to such fresh, glorious burgers when I head back to Atlanta for school.\n\nThe Big Mac WISHES it could be a Double Double. \n\nThe fries aren't that great--then again, I haven't tried Animal Style yet--but the burgers are more than meat enough for me. ;3"
0,"Food good.\n\nSoda/water warm (you gotta add ice)\n\nRestaurant dirty (you gotta clean the place...if the bathroom is dirty, I don't even what to know what the kitchen looks like)\n\nClean the place and it might be a 3 to a 4."
1,Getting away from the greasy hullabaloo of Plaza Midwood for a quick and healthy lunch (with Jared!) is easy at this Subway location.  It's large and just enough out of the way that there's always a seat.  It also happens to have nice bathrooms.  I can't remember the last time I  was at a Subway with nice bathrooms.  And they definitely get points for cleanliness.  \n\nHowever I'm withholding a star because the customer service can be sub-par.  The sandwich maker and cashier simply don't seem to want to talk much.  Maybe they were having a bad day when I visited.  I promise it's not my fault!
0,To the barista that made my drink I saw you drop my cup and didn't give me a new one. Luckily I don't drink off of my rim that I wont complain and mess up your long line of drinks. Which btw wouldn't be so long if all your partners were actually working!!!
0,"I ordered shrimp fried rice ,the shrimp is not fresh . rice is burned . severs terrible . everything is so expensive! I never come back there!"
1,"Swanky yet comfortable bar adjacent to the lobby of the Delano (formerly Mandalay's THE Hotel) on the south strip. Nice environ with knowledgeable bartenders serving craft beers and mixologist cocktails. It's tucked away, allowing patrons to mingle in the shadows while enjoying a nice drink or two. Not a destination in itself, but a good place to catch a drink or two while waiting for the real Vegas festivities to commence. Also note: Franklin. . .at the Delano. . .like the former President Roosevelt."
0,Your cage wait time is the reason I won't mess with you! NO MORE' u guys are progressively getting worse.
0,"Slow, no refills and sticky rice was so hard I gave it back and he told me that's how it is and returned it to me, if I didn't like it then why the hell would you give it back?"
0,I called Ted originally on Wednesday 7/23/14 to come out to the house to fix something on the pool pump. I set up the appointment for 10am the next morning.  I wanted the pump fixed prior to leaving town for a few days. No call no show. I tried calling the number but went straight to voicemail. I left him a message to call me back but didn't hear back until later that afternoon. So he apologized for not being to come that day. When we got back from the trip I sent him a message to see if he would be able to come to the house again. He replied that he could come Tuesday 7/29/14 at 5:30pm. NO CALL NO SHOW AGAIN. I finally left him a message not to bother coming out and that we will have someone else take care of it. EXTREMELY UNRELIABLE EVEN AFTER 2 APPOINTMENTS!!  I would not use them. A complete waste of my time.
1,"I absolutely love this hotel. When my boyfriend and I checked in they asked us if we wanted watered bottles, which was really  nice. The look of the hotel was very pretty..when I walked into our room there was a light, nice smelling scent. The room is definitely cleaner than most hotels I've been to. The decor was very pretty as well. In the morning we got free breakfast that serves from 6-10am. Their breakfast was beyond what we were expecting. Very delicious with bacon, eggs, bagels, etc. I definitely would recommend anyone who's stopping by Scottsdale to try this hotel. Completely in love with it! Oh and one more thing, we booked through Expedia so our one bed-room was only 40 dollars (tax included) for a Friday night. How cheap is that for such a nice hotel? Definitely go there!"
0,Wondering if the two pair deal is too good to be true?  It is.  \n\nI went in on a Thursday afternoon.  Two people were working and there was only one other customer in the store.  One employee greeted me and then returned to he desk to play on his cell phone.  I shopped for about a half hour trying on frames and finally left because no one would help me.  \n\nThe moral of the story: no one will help you if you are standing by the $79 frames.
1,"Best sandwiches in town. This has become myfavorite sandwich shop.   Love the theme,  reminds me of my  youth.   Great friendly staff"
1,"THE BEST BURGERS AND FRIES EVER! Everthing I have tried from here is amazing. The 4 stars would be a 5 if I didn't have to stand in line (outside) to wait for a table, then stand in line to order cafeteria style at the bar AND again for food, then have a server get me a soda refill and leave me feeling like I am supposed to leave a tip. If this place offered a comfertable place to sit while waiting and table service it would be a 5 star for sure."
0,I found the experience today less than desirable as Kyle who was making my drink with his long hair hanging down over his eye's.  As he was making the drink shaking his hair and who knows what was falling into my drink. You would think management would have him wear a hair net. I will no longer order drinks if Kyle is working with his hair dangling over my drink.
1,"Okay so its defiinitely not our famous Taiwanese Shaved ice shop: Class 302 in Rowland Heights, CA...**WHich is to die for!*** But I would say its up there for Las Vegas...If you aren't near Class 302...have the luxury of stopping by this neat creamy shaved ice dessert place and get $15 hour long leg massages across the street... you should surely give this place a try... (This place may be a 2.5-3.0 for all who fits this category)\n\nTheir milk tea: plenty...refreshing and tasty.  Boba was soft.\n\nShaved ice: a bit different..Had Taro flavored shaved ice, with fresh fruits and mochi bites.  The serving was a bit smaller ...two people could share but that's stretching it a bit.  Lots of fruits and mochi.  It was pretty refreshing.  \n\nI also had their chicken wings...it could have been better as it was a little on the salty side.  I couldn't finish it.  The skin was not consistent...it was crunchy in some places...and burnt in others...The bf ended up eating it all so none went to waste. :)\n\nIf i still reside in vegas...I would be back...because you have my heart for shaved ice.  Keep up the good work! :)\n\nHad to dock a point off because once you' ve tried CLASS 302..you'll know exactly why.  \n\n\nSorry! ...but happy desserting Yelpers!\n\nTK"
1,"This place is definitely in the shadier side of town. Just on the other side of the parking lot is a motel, which has a wedding chapel and seems like the rooms get rented out by the hour. Also, as a hint to those who have a hard time finding it, the place doesn't seem to have lighted signs, which in stark contrast to all the places around it.\n\nAs for the food, we ordered the Thai Papaya Salad, Pad Thai with Beef, and Red Curry with Chicken (~$29 total) as take-out. I really was expecting mediocre or worse. However, it was better than I expected. Granted it wasn't the best I've ever tasted. But, it you're looking for some reasonably priced Thai food near the Strip, this is a good place to check out. General flavors were there. The papaya salad had good flavor and kick, though a bit on the soggy side, which might have been due to the time between cooking and consumption for take-out."
1,"I have previously eaten at the Simon before and the food was exceptional. This time around I set up a business dinner with Simon Restaurant about 2 months ago with Julie for our Cloud b business dinner on Sunday, September 7, 2014. The room they placed us in was beautiful and overlooked the pool. The ambiance was great. The waiter and staff was very friendly and on top of everything making sure our glasses were never empty. The food was amazing from the wok chard edamame to the calamari with ponzu sauce to the pasta to the curry chicken to dessert which included cookies, brownies, and cotton candy. Except for the Meatloaf. It was a bit dry, lacked taste and the bbq sauce on top was too much. The mashed potatoes melted in your mouth but I think the show stopper was the dessert! I think everyone's eyes were bigger than our tummies. Of course the kids enjoyed it! I'm giving the Simon, on this review, only a 4 star. The chefs forgot to send us the fries which were on our menu. I spoke to the waiter and he spoke with the manager and they said it would be taken off the bill.  Julie went out of her way to add our logo to the menu. Everyone enjoyed the family style dinner. Overall, great experience and would recommend for a wedding dinner or business dinner again."
0,"I've had Subway many times before moving to Arizona so I know they have good sandwiches. However, I will never eat at this particular Subway. My husband ordered two Turkey sandwiches to go and it was literally the worst sandwich I ever had in my life. Stale bread, and something definitely funky with the turkey, cheese, and lettuce. Like they used old ingredients.  I was sharing my sandwich with my 3 year old but after tasting it, I threw it in the garbage because I was afraid that we were going to get sick. Will not try anything from there again."
1,My picks:\nHandcrafted Jalapeno Margarita (with Don Julio)\nChef's selection of cheese plate\nCaramel Cheesecake Cr\u00e8me Br\u00fble\u00e9\nCh\u00e8vre Cheesecake\n\nAsk for Jason when sitting at the bar.  I can eat appetizers and deserts here any day and be happy the happiest person on earth.\n\nChef Lee has transformed this Phoenix classic into one of my favorite hidden treasures.
1,"Saw reviews and sounded good.  I ordered the Chicken parm. I highly suggest this dish.  Not oversized but just enough for me (but I'm not a big eater).  This is the first time I've ordered this so I have nothing to compare it to but it was delicious!  Lemon drop martini.... kinda bitter.. they use their homemade lemonciello or however you spell that.  Had very good service and that's a big thing to me.  The veal with creamy sauce and mushrooms is what my hubby got... very creamy and veal very thin... he was still hungry when he was done and he's not a big eater!  But he said it was very tastey.  My aunt had a fish special with black olives and capers - she said fish was done perfect but the dish was a bit salty (olives and capers might be why).  My uncle got some eggplant dish with a lot of cheese... was just okay... very cheesy.. so if you like cheese... go for it.  It was just a nice, local, italian place.  Not too fancy, very comfortable, reasonable size dishes.  I'd give them a shot."
1,"This place has some of the best tacos I've had in a while.  I had the suadero and carnitas.  Both were tender and delicious on freshly made corn tortillas.  You must try an elote, Mexican style corn on the cob.  It was perfect and flavorful, buttery, cheesy, limey, and spicy. They also have authentic and perfect Guacamole. The salsa bar is one of the best: salad and vegetable accompaniments, hot black and pinto beans, and a tasty array of salsas.  The service was perfect; these people are so kind and helpful and treated us like family. The place was immaculately clean.  Try it!!!"
0,"We came here for a bday party and on a consistent level, the service was terrible. I guess we had a server AND a food runner because after being completely ignored for 20 mins we finally flagged down (we later found out) the food runner. She said she wasn't our waitress but would take our order. When we asked her opinion about the food she told us, \""the food here sucks\"". So we just picked a cheese crisp. After waiting 15 minutes for the beer we ordered, we flagged down the server who said, \""oh, don't order from her, she's just the food runner\"" WTH? It took forever to get any kind of service and everyone walks around there like they are lost. The only time we go there is if someone is having a party which is too bad because the concept is good but the food and service always sucks. Stop hiring the girls for their looks and get someone in there with a brain."
1,HUGE fan of the food! Everything is really good here.  I do wish the atmosphere was a little trendier....it's such a great local place. HIGHLY recommend!
1,"Best sisig ever! It's my guilty pleasure. Soooo bad for you, but soooo good! So who cares?!\n\nThe bartender is on top of it & super friendly. Love all the staff here. \n\nI love coming here on ballroom night. Which is Thursday's, I think. It's nice watching everyone having a good time."
0,"First off, I'm not one of those two star reviewers. You know the kind: \""It cost so much!\"" \""I don't get the food, I like hamburgers.\"" \""This place is too fancy, so here's your one star.\"" That's not me. I am a foodie. Check my other reviews for proof. So, given this disclaimer here's my two cents on L'Atlier...\n\nOne word: \nHalf-assed.\n\nPre-game:\nOur group of nine ate here this last weekend. I made reservations in advance. They required a $75 reservation fee (non-refundable and not applied to the meal) . That's a first. And because we were a large group we were limited to tasting menus only. Fine. Ain't no thing - this place is #2 on Yelp. I'm excited! I love food!\n\nThe experience:\nWe were smashed into the wall. There was not enough room to get into our seats. Once the table was moved so all the ladies, in their lovely dresses, could shimmy in, they were trapped - the whole meal - full bladders and all. The service sucked. They already had their guaranteed 20% gratuity (because of our party size). So, we endured a meal full of empty glasses, missing silverware, and a wonky table.\n\nThe Food:\nAverage. We had two vegetarians with us (the restaurant knew about this ahead of time) and when the amuse arrived they were served foie gras mouse. You can't take the time to whip them up a gazpacho shooter? Two of the courses (in a row) had the same pesto sauce. Not a big deal, but the primary components were so bland all you could taste was pesto. \""Sir, for your fist and second courses this evening you will be having pesto.\"" Come-on! Most of the dishes were one note. In general the meal was uninspired. \n\nIn summary:\nWe left disappointed. Michelin should revoke their one star. I know it's harsh, but it's truth. Do you hear me, Bibendum?"
1,"Low prices, good car, adequate service, easy enough to get to, I thought they were fine. I just hopped the \""regular\"" car rental shuttle to the rental center, and then hopped the Fox shuttle to their place. Easy.\n\nI picked up the car at 8 p.m. on a Tuesday and dropped off at 8:30 p.m. on a Sunday, so perhaps they weren't as busy as other times of the day.\n\nThe staff were friendly enough and got the job done. \n\nFive days for just over $200 with unlimited miles. I'll go back there again."
0,"horrible food.  tacky, dirty atmosphere.  honestly i'll never go back, the food quality is incredibly subpar."
1,"I heart pizzas! So the girls and I were starrrving before a night out and we needed a quick bite (since we took like 4 hrs getting ready lol) \n\nPizza Place was perfect for that, such a cute place. I had a cheese pizza.. (yeah I'm boring) the rest had the pesto pizza which I think they enjoyed because we were all super quiet munchin on our pizzas...The crushed red peppers weren't all that spicy so make u sure u pile a lot on!  P.S. and the pizza slices are big! \n\nDefinitley good for groups and kids! They have tv's all around a inside you get a great view of on of the Wynn's waterfalls. :) The Wynn is gorgeous."
1,"8/23/14. Yea!! We went back and they are open.. The Owner talked with us and they had an Emergency. Im glad they are still here!\nI tried the Green Chili Plate that has Pork, rice, beans and Flour tortilla. It was Delicious!! My husband had the Carne Asada Tacos and Bean and Cheese burritos. Loved it!!\nCant get enough of this place we will be back. They may be small But they know how  to Cook Mexican Food and the Customer Service is Fantastic!!"
1,"I usually get my eyebrows threaded on my visits to California but I couldn't wait for my next trip any more. I found a great deal on groupon, 3 eyebrow threading sessions for $11! This is a steal since usually their eyebrow threading is $8 per session. The lady who did my eyebrows and my friends was the owners niece. She was so sweet and she told us she was going through cosmetology school. Her service was EXCELLENT! Super kind and professional. She made my friend and I feel so comfortable. My eyebrows look awesome and my friend and I were in and out in under 20 mins or less. We went on Saturday around 11am (3/1/2014). The salon was clean and tidy. She shaped my eyebrows so good and didn't over pluck. I will definitely be returning!! I highly recommend this salon :)"
1,"This location has been re-born as a really comfortable hang-out.  NICE open patio for the bar, choice of couch seating and low top or high top tables.  \n\nWay to support the local breweries with a very solid offering of brews from all over Arizona!  \n\nNice menu, not to full of itself but interesting enough to make us ask a few questions.  The Yucca Chips are nothing more than a crunch delivery system for the guacamole which is tasty!\n\nHusband says YES to the fresh, flavorful, juicy burger - even the bun was good and it stood up to the toppings!\n\nApple pie tasted homemade except BETTER because my crust sucks and their's did not!    GOOD DATE NIGHT PLACE or place to meet up with friends and hang!"
1,Absolutely the best sushi I have ever had!
0,"I want to give places the benefit of the doubt. Especially ones that have positive reviews, have been recommended by locals and have been around awhile even with heavy competition close by and a fairly pricey menu. So when our first round of drinks took 15 minutes to arrive, and our old fashioned was made incorrectly (a place like this with an expansive bar should know how to make an old fashioned, yes?), I reminded myself that the food was supposed to be awesome. We were on vacation, with good friends and were prepared to have a great evening so I really was not looking to spoil it for myself. \n\nAnd then our waiter opened his mouth. I asked for some explanation of menu items, many of which had either no explanation or description or was a puzzling mess of adjectives and much-too-hip-and-cool titles.  When asked for some help to decipher parts of the menu that - while it appeared to be in English - might as well have been written in a foreign language, our waiter started in with a host of racist remarks - like maybe he could find his Vietnamese friend to interpret for me, or go get me some dim sum instead. When I didn't laugh, he asked what I wanted an explanation of but I was so over it. He returned to the table after a few minutes, likely feeling slightly remorseful about his inappropriate comments (or more likely trying to resurrect his shrinking tip potential) and started rattling off at 100mph a verbal dissertation of a few menu items. No one at our table could understand much of what he said. I guess he was having a bad night and unfortunately it did rub off some on us. One bright star was the manager who came by to drop off a list of breakfast and lunch places he wanted to recommend after having had a conversation about this with our friends before our arrival. We did not mention our waiter - no one wanted to have a negative conversation and further spoil what was supposed to be a fun evening.  \n\nAs for the food, well, it's hard to be fair given the bitter palate created by the waiter. I had the mini mushroom pan fry (serious potential, but slightly greasy and sadly under salted) and a salad (which was \""fine\""). My husband had the swordfish (butter sauce was yummy), our friends the bison meatloaf and the filet mignon. Both were pretty good. Desserts earned higher praise, allowing me to move Cowboy Ciao up to 2 stars - bread pudding, ice cream trio and the birthday cake were all delicious and a satisfying end to an otherwise disappointing experience. \n\nI would not recommend Cowboy Ciao to anyone visiting the Scottsdale - there are too many fabulous restaurants in this area to waste time with poorly trained staff."
1,"If you're big into driving to the middle of nowhere for Cuban food (in a strip mall) (in the desert)...this place is great. (Like, who thought that their target market of Cuban foodies was as far west in 85045 as you can get before hitting the reservation??? Hmmm.)\n\nRopa Vieja...delicious. Slow cooked cuban style shredded flank steak done right. Even had a bite of \""The Infamous Cuban Sandwich\""... Everything an infamous cuban sandwich could boast of. Really...yumx2.\n\nI don't think they could have done any better with this space...ambiance fit for a far superior location. \nSo, where were all the people??? \nFour stars because the food was fantastic, the service outstanding and the Mojitos near perfection...but, lacking were any other humanoid forms to share the experience. Funny, but I guess I enjoy fellow patrons in encounters of all things cuba, mojito or vieja...\n\nMarketing people...look into it. \n\nWill go back another night and try again."
1,"Normal Starbuck's store.  The barista was efficient, the order was taken promptly, and the wifi for my iPhone was quite convenient after being in a back country area where there was no coverage."
0,"It's no Pita Jungle, but Pita Pit it's an okay place to grab a bite to eat in Happy Valley. Their selection is kind of small, but they let you create your pita (kind of like Subway). The service is really friendly, and generally they're not that busy (at least when I go about mid-day). \n\nOther than letting you customize your pitas, there's not much else special about Pita Pit. Taste/Flavor factor is maybe a 2 out of 5 stars. Portions that I've gotten are fairly large, but I've heard of people not getting that big of a pita before.\n\nSo, Norterra...when are you going to get a Pita Jungle?! Seriously."
0,"Brought my 8 yo daughter for princess party activity I found on their website, But when we arrived the employee didn't know anything about it! We ended up paying to paint an object but even when I told the girl we'd never done this before & required assistance she was only marginally helpful. I spent $40 and left irritated. Thank goodness my daughter enjoyed the painting part."
0,"If only I could give a 0 star,  this place is dirty,  smells and the hotel is very old. The dealers,  oh how rude they are...  They actually laugh at you when you lose money.  Never going their again!"
0,"Another Frozen Yogurt Joint.......... \n\nThey have similar setup as most places now days, serve your self, $.39 cents per oz . \n\nOriginal Tart and a handful of other flavors. \nI tried a sample of the Taro flavor, it was interesting. \n\nThen decided on the Original Tart and Blueberry. \nThe Tart was not tart at all and the blueberry which wasn't sugar free and all natural was way too sweet, go figure. \n\nI did not enjoy it and I was bummed. \nThey did have fresh fruit though :-) \n\nThey are brand new maybe things will change. \n\nI'm sure there will be people who will enjoy this yogurt but it's not one of my favorites."
1,"Four on a good day, three on others.\n\nIt's a really nice custard, where it goes down to a three is day and time of day you show up.\n\nThis last visit, I was first in line when it opened, so, full selection of flavors for the day. And had flavors that were not vanilla or chocolate. The other flavors were very good. \n\nAs others said, if stuck with vanilla, meh. Wrong day and or late in the day, the flavors they have left might not be inspiring.\n\nSo get there early in the day, and don't add extra stuff to it: order a plain cone or cup, and you should be happy."
0,No coffee maker no mini fridge bad internet terrible customer service as radio went off in room adjacent to mine late evening hours and it took security over half hour to come turn off after I called several times and had them hang up on me
1,"I have been here twice and for the most part I have had a lot of fun. A few things you should know beforehand. First, go earlier in the day if you don't want to be absolutely destroyed by teenagers; especially if you have younger kids. I took my girlfriends six year old daughter and she had a hard time competing with teenagers who would shoot her relentlessly for the points. After the first game, I got her to follow me around and she did a lot better (Perhaps they felt differently about trying to pick on someone who is 6'5 and 250 Pounds and I could explain to her how to play). Secondly, it helps to have an understanding of how the game works. Most people score a lot of points because they can hit all four bases of the opposing colors. Even if you only have two teams playing, there are three colors and the other two colors opposing bases can still be shot. (I learned that after game 1). Despite some of these issues my girlfriend's daughter still had a good time and the staff did a great job of catering to her. They also try and break the teams up so it wasn't us against teenage laser tag assassins.  Kudos to them for that. All in all, it was a good experience."
1,"Make sure you go earlier in the day, when the cupcakes are fresh.  If you go to late in the afternoon they tend to get a little dry...but either way they are SCORES better than cupcakery and freed's bakery's cupcakes.  The peanut butter cup cupcake rocks."
0,"We didn't get to try the food. I read the reviews and thought that there was no way that they would charge $8.00 if you are sharing your plate with someone else, but they really do! The waitress was an older lady and extremely rude when she sat us like we were burdening her. Then when we ordered 2 entres for 3 of us to split she said \""get another order and take it home or they will charge you $8.00\"". My husband said that he just wouldn't eat. Then the guy comes from the back and tells us the same thing, if we didn't order another plate, he would charge us 8.00! It was the rudest thing I have ever heard. I'm Italian and Italians share! It's just what we do! We got up and left. The prices are pretty high anyway and then to charge a large amount just because you aren't hungry is ridiculous! I won't go back. I don't believe this restaurant will be in business for very much longer. No one wants bad service. We are a friendly town and when people come in that are rude like this no one wants to patronize there."
0,"I have a 5 year old unit and am on my 4th blower motor. 2 summers ago I had them come out to repair the blower motor on a 3 year old Carrier unit. The tech took forever to fix and even had to call out another tech, they didn't finish until after 10pm and even then the repairs weren't complete because they had to order a defrost board. The part was supposed to be replaced with manufacture warranty parts. A year later the blower motor failed again, this time I called another company, The other company tells me that they didn't use a manufactured replacement part and that the part they did put it was to big. So called efficiency to come fix the motor, luckily it was still under their 1 year warranty. 1 year and 2 months later the blower has failed again but this time all they offered was 15% off repairs."
0,ZERO STARS!!! DON'T EVER TAKE YOUR PET HERE!!! I just picked my dog up from caspers after a 5 hour wait. When I arrived my Mini Yorkie was completely shaved down and didn't even have hair on his face! Yorkies have a very specific way of grooming. I told the girl we shouldn't have to pay because it was seriously and embarrassment of a grooming job!! The owner came out upset (extremely money hungry) saying they would just do a better job next time. I asked her again for a refund she was extremely upset and literally threw my money back at me and my wife and told us to never come back to her shop!! I was completely shocked at her behavior especially when the girl who groomed our dog and the owner herself BOTH ADMITTED that they did a terrible job. Never in my life have I been treated this way! Especially when they made the mistake. Please don't bring business to this terrible woman you will thank me later! And so will your dog!!
0,"I've never eaten at Hardee's.\n\nI've been to Hardee's twice. Once was waaay back in 2008 or so, when I went in and ordered some chicken tenders. They told me they were out of chicken tenders (?) so I'd have to order something else. Pass. I've been avoiding it ever since.\n\nYesterday, boyfriend and friends wanted Hardee's. I figured it was time to let bygones be bygones, so I went to Hardee's and ordered the three-chicken-tender combo basket with curly fries and a drink. The girl behind the counter was efficient but rushed, which is kind of what I expect from fast food employees, so I'm not really fazed by that. My friends were already seated and served, so I filled my beverage and sat with them. I made sure my number was prominently displayed near the edge of the table, as directed.\n\nBoyfriend finishes eating basically as soon as I sit down. This is normal.\n\nFriend A finishes his burger about five minutes later. Still no sign of my food.\n\nFriend B finishes her meal. By now it's been ten minutes. Hmm.\n\nI notice that people who were three spots behind me in line have been served and have FINISHED at this point.\n\nI check my receipt. It's been fifteen minutes. My friends need to get back to work. I flag down the next passing employee, who happens to be the manager. I ask him what had happened to my food. Manager disappears, comes back three or so minutes later. Apparently the person who put my tenders in to cook forgot to set a timer (??) and they burned, so rest assured, they were going to make me new ones and they should be ready in another five minutes or so.\n\nNo.\n\nI tell him to cancel my order and give me a refund. He was sincere and apologetic, which I appreciate, but at this point I had been in the restaurant for over a half an hour with no food. I'm patient for the most part, but there was no offer to comp the meal, just.. \""Hey, keep waiting and we might feed you in another few minutes. Maybe!\"" I understand that they may have been understaffed and that it was the lunch rush, but how no one noticed that one order wasn't filled for 15 + minutes just boggles my mind. I took the money from my refund and went next door to Taco Bell, where I was served terrible but tasty food very promptly and with much kindness. I really love the Taco Bell on Neil. It's clean, friendly, and the girl who works the register during lunch is awesome. I even make substitutions and deletions to my order, and they have NEVER gotten it wrong. So, the moral of this story, in short - save your time and money by skipping Hardee's and go next door to Taco Bell."
0,"I will give Dr. Francois a 5-star, she's great! Very sweet and caring.  The front staff a 1-star.  They are the opposite of Dr. Francois.  I called to schedule an appointment and I told them I was in the neighborhood and could drop off my doctors order.  They said no, just have it faxed, when I mention that I didn't have access to a fax and can still drop off the order they told me to call my doctor and have it faxed. They are so unwilling to work with you and make it easy for you to schedule an appointment.  Also they said that once they receive the order that they would call me but that never happened.  I'm a busy person working full-time now with my second pregnancy, a toddler, school...they need to remember that people are busy and don't have time to wait by the phone to see when it is convenient for them to call you.  Still no follow-up!  I went to Amomi with my first pregnancy and two years ago it was the same story with the front office staff.  If they're that busy they need to get more people up there.  I don't think customer service is their number one priority.  But when you are expecting you would think that this type of service would cater to its patients.  So my review includes my previous experience and now my second current experience, still not impressed."
0,"Had egg drop soup, salt pepper pork chop, lettuce wraps, Chinese broccoli... Wasn't impressed by any of it."
1,"Upon landing in Phoenix the first thing our children said was \""let's find an in and out burger!\""  New York doesn't have in and out burgers and they hoped by being \"" out west\"" they could have the treat they remembered from other trips, and they were not disappointed.  Delicious hamburgers, shakes and fries. Fast service even with a line. And a Target nearby for us to gather necessities for our trip. A great way to begin our National Parks adventure."
0,I purchased a Groupon to us this vendor. \nThey are rude and they left my home in a mess. They came in with dirty shoes and no coverings for them and left dirt in my home. The guy is rude and when I did not want to upgrade he got even ruder. \nHopefully by adding this review they will learn cheap service on an offer such as this will never gain them repeat business.
0,"Quite a disappointment. Service was very polite and friendly, but the kitchen was painfully slow. 3 different kinds of oysters but our waiter couldn't tell us the difference between them. The frog legs were tasty but very oily. The crawfish and trout was really salty. My boyfriend got the ribeye fillet and couldn't finish more than a few bites because the reduction was way too rich and pungent. \n\nBest part were the pretzel rolls, wasn't worth a $140 bill"
1,"So excited that there will be a new place to go in the Lakes area. Have eaten here twice and everything we tried was amazing. My daughter loves the fries, so have even gotten them to go to take to her. I cannot wait to see what the inside looks like when complete. With support from the community, I think this will be a great \""go to\"" place for years to come."
1,"Jime rocks. Didn't know about this place at all, but saw it walking by. Decided to get a tattoo and went for it. Jime drew up a sketch quick and then had me out of there in about an hour. Amazing experience and amazing tattoo. I wish our tattoo places in my city were as accommodating. Next time I'm in Vegas, Jime is my \""go to\"" artist."
1,"Places seem to come and go at this location I missed the last one.  came like the day after it shut its doors so I wasn't going to be left out this time.  Glad I went,  Had the Stand Cheeseburger, fries and a Banana Shake it was all good.(Love the HUGE straws) looking forward to making it back to try some of those Tacos!!  \n\nLets see if we can keep this place going and break that bad location mojo."
1,"There are two sections of Payards - there's a quick fast food side that's decked out in fancy chocolate covered artsy interior design that's eye catching from the casino.  Then if you walk a little further in, there's a cute little restaurant area with hair back booths and a circular kitchen right in the middle where the chefs prepare your food.  We had to wait about 20 minutes for a table - group of 8 girls in a small restaurant during brunch time - it's bound to happen.  \n\nWe planned on going to the Caesar's buffet in a few short hours so our intention here was a light breakfast so we save the valuable real estate for later.  Well - that didn't happen.  Not even close... before I could even stop myself I ended up ordering their fish of the day - Sea bass. And I am so glad that I did!  It was delicious - seared perfectly on the outside so it's crispy and flavorful while the fish meat was juicy and moist.  Even the bed of ratatouille and sauce pair perfectly with the fish.  Having nibbles here and there of other plates, there wasn't one that I didn't find absolutely delicious in it's own way.  Highlights include their parfait (I'm not a huge parfait fan, besides the mcdonalds variety, and this one had just a hint of orange juice in the yogurt that bumped it up to a whole new level!) and  lobster benedict croissant.   \n\nThe service was mediocre - they were short staffed that day and I believe I saw the waiter roll his eyes when one of the girls only ordered a fruit cup.  Even so, I'd definitely come back to this place for the food - delicious!"
1,"I like Firebirds.  It is was it is.  Nice environment, reasonable food.  Servers are usually pretty good.  Bartenders are always dead on.\nOnly complaint.... PLEASE take your thumb out of my food when delivering it!!!  Use a tray if you have to.\nNew location is beautiful too."
0,"Overpriced.  Pretty good selection of rolls, but if you prefer nigiri sushi you can do much better.  Very nice modern decoration and ambiance.  The service is good.  The place is very clean."
1,"First time here last night and had a great experience! Our server did a fantastic job in my opinion she was very attentive and personable.  She wasn't overly formal which is a weird pet peeve of mine. Our waters were always full, drinks refilled and table clean.  \n\nOnto the food. We started with the zucchini appetizer which was all kinds of amazing! They were lightly dusted with parmesan cheese and served with a lemon aioli of some sort. Very delicious. My boyfriend thought they had a little too much batter, but I thought they were perfect. We asked for a side of marinara or meat sauce with the app and our server gladly brought us a little of both. They too were very good! Very different from each other which I thought was nice.\n\nI ordered the Chicken Francese, I think that's how it's spelled, with angel hair pasta instead of the potatoes. It was a lemon chicken with a parmesan crust and what I would describe as a light creamy mushroom sauce. Idk but it was good! Not too lemony or heavy on the sauce and the perfect portion. I saved one chicken breast to take home because I wanted some later.\n\nMy boyfriend ordered the rigatoni d which he was really disappointed with.  It had an odd sweet flavor to it. We took most of it home with us and never touched it after that. \n\nOverall it was a good experience! I definitely will be back to try something new!"
0,"Went her on 4/21 paid $20.00 for a awful car wash when the guy drying my car held up his rag we walked ove open the door and the door jams were still filth , dash was still dusty when the mgr walked ove and I should him he says we only clean that stuff with a detail needless to say he did end up doing mine I'll never return here !!!!"
1,"Sunday evening my hubby & I were looking for a place to have dinner & The Vig came to mind so off we went. It was pretty early, about 5:45pm, so we beat the dinner crowd. We were seated in a comfy booth with a view of their open area patio. I know this is such a girl thing to say, but I love their bathroom sinks! \n\nFor starters we got the crab & artichoke dip. It was rich & creamy & just the right amount for 2 people. The spiced pita chips that came with were a yummy pairing. I also got a cocktail, captain appleseed. It smelled just like apple pie but was a bit too strong for my liking. For our entrees; my hubby got the rubin's cuban sandwich with a mixed green salad & I got the horseradish crusted tilapia that came with a crab stuffed portobello, asparagus, potatoes & a roasted red pepper sauce. Hubs loved his sandwich & salad, everything tasted extremely fresh. I also loved my fish & every single side, I cleaned my plate which means I was hungry & it was delicious! Even though I was stuffed, I had to get dessert. I got the bread pudding with vanilla ice cream to go. We dug in later that night & it was pretty good, big enough for 2-3 people.\n\nTotal (not including tip) for a cocktail, an app, 2 entrees & dessert was about $57. A lil pricey but the food was great so I'd say it's worth it!"
0,Wish I could 0 stars ...will rob you of your hard earned money. I took it for a check engine light and they charged me 200 without even fixing it suggesting it to take it to volvo sr...an oil change mechanic fixed the check engine in 10 min after retrieving code ..it was some kind of cap that he needed to tighten which lead to some leak. And it was free of cost.
1,"I don't have a lot of experience with cars or car repair places. I never owned a car until moving to Phoenix. I went here when my husband's car needed some work and vowed to bring my car when the need arose.\n\nWell, 3 months and I'm not a customer. I got a discount on services because my husband referred me. This place is so freaking cool on the inside. The lounge is clean, comfortable, and visually appealing. The staff is hard working and honest. I'm referring EVERYONE I know to 180."
0,"Extremely overpriced for what you get. You end up paying nearly $50 if you get bottomless mimosas. That really isn't as great as it sounds. I'm sure their dinner is better. But their lunch selection is not all that special. Maybe it's because they serve a lot of breakfast foods, and I'm not a huge fan of those types of food. Their banana hazelnut toast was interesting and fresh, but a huge portion to say the least. Their omelets were fresh and made to serve so you can customize it in which ever way you'd like. I'd say my favorite entree there would be the bleu cheese pasta. But that was about it. Their soups were boring, salmon was dry, and chicken skewers looked cool but were really just cold and tough. I just felt like it was a dressed up hometown buffet.. nothing special. I probably could've done more with that $50 out on the floor of the casino because I didn't have much of an appetite for their food."
0,"This was technically the Clarion hotel so I think the name is wrong on the page. \n\nI'd like to start by saying that I'm not much of a complainer, but if could have given 0 stars, I would have. \n\nSo we are on our way up to room when we passed a vending machine with water underneath it. I assumed it was leaking and brushed it off. I don't care that much about little things like that especially since we were just sleeping there. After a great hockey game and a bar crawl, we came back to the hotel and got ready for bed. There was absolutely no hot water for my shower. So cold I wouldn't even consider hopping in really quick. It was late so I let it go and decided to try again in the morning. When I woke up it was the same thing. At this point I was fuming. I NEED a shower man!\n\nSo I put on my angry pants and headed down the hall towards the elevator. Right in front of the elevator door there is a water fall pouring out of the ceiling from the third floor. \""What the hell....\"" is pretty much what I was thinking at this point. Well there was my shower considering I had to walk through it to continue on my quest. As soon as the elevator doors open to the first floor, I see the hallway is flooded. The carpet is squishing beneath my feet all the way to the front desk where other angry people had beaten me to. Apparently a pipe had burst the day before and they had neglected to tell us that when we had checked in. I was so mad. I managed to get 70% off our bill and I made her call to check us in at another hotel. I would have insisted the whole bill be paid for but I'm really bad at being mean to people. All in all, I will never stay here or any other branch of this hotel again."
0,The food is alright but the service is horrible. Trying to get someone's attention to ask a question is next to impossible. Ordered wings and bread- had to wait almost 25 minutes to get them. In the end I had to get someone's attention for help and found out the food had been ready for a while they just forgot to call my name. By the time I got to eat the food was barely warm. My suggestion- try barros instead.
0,"Went back to Aureole after about 2 years and a very good meal. Mandalay Bay has become rather seedy like the rest of the strip. Entering the restaurant one is \""greeted\"" on a very cool level by a maitr D' speaking to a helper. They continued their conversation for a few minutes before seating us. Not an auspicious beginning. The menu arrives and it is their most expensive, the tasting menu. We asked for their other menus, a prix fixe and an a la carte. They seated us in the Swan Court which used to cost an extra $10, petty no. They don't charge that now but you have to have the tasting menu there. When I told them, in less coarse terms, that they were nuts, they said I could stay there with any menu. Whooppee. The 4000 bottle wine list has 2 Beujolois, none of them high quality. The wine is horribly overpriced, I would guess 400% over cost. A pleasant young man acting as sommelier hung in and finally bought us an OK Spanish wine for $75. We ordered a la carte. A foix gras we ordered turned out to be seared, not a pate. They rectified that. If you are very strong you can get what you want. The service was good, the food excellent. Bottom line the place has absolutely no class. There is nothing elegant about it or the hotel. Upon leaving we asked them to call the valet to get our car ready. That was against their policy for some really inane reason. As I said, no class at all. We will never return."
0,"At first glance, the place was really nice. We walk up to the girl up front and asked for a table for 2, inside. She tells us 5 minutes, which was fine... until we start to notice that a good 7 other 2-4 person groups just arriving and being seated way before us even though we were there before them. A bit confused, I went up to the counter and asked if we were forgotten-- the look on the girl's face let me know the answer. Her mouth wide open in a confused daze, she looks at another waitress for help. Luckily, the other waitress, without saying a word, leads us over to our table. Now... I wouldn't have been so upset over this... had either one of them apologized. Not one apology was uttered; instead, the girl in front had looked at me like I was pestering her all night. So that started me off on the wrong foot already.\n\nOur waitress was not bad, and we put in our order. The food arrived, and I guess somewhere along the line, someone thought white rice = brown rice. By this point I was already too ticked off to even want to deal with waiting any longer, so I just accepted the wrongly-ordered meal. \n\nLuckily this place's food was good. That's where the 2nd star comes from.\n\nThrough all this, not one apology was issued, and no offers to make up for the lousy service.\n\n2 stars -- terrible service."
1,"The service here is truly outstanding. The only \""bad\"" thing is that it can get pretty busy and since they give each customer's tires lots of individual TLC, the wait time can get a bit long at busy times. The good news is that you can plan ahead by scheduling an appointment on their website to drastically reduce your waiting. I would highly recommend coming here for any tire needs."
0,"I went there last night with some of my gal pals.  I had been there a few weeks ago with a guy and thought it wasn't bad.  Alas, this time out, not the same.  Two of the women I was with said the server was rude.  I thought, hmmm, not possible cause when I was there prior, the server seemed nice.  Well, unfortunately, they were right.  She seemed in a hurry and we had to practically chase her down for service.   When she came, she acted rushed and each time rushed off before the words were completely out of our mouths.    The appetizers we ordered off the happy hour menu were mediocre at best.  So sad that it was a complete disappointment to all of us.  I was hoping for better. ..."
0,"I should preface this by saying I'm a bit of a hotel snob. Maybe not \""snob\"", but due to work I've honestly spent multiple years of my life living in hotels, which is more than most people. I've had great stays at inexpensive places because they keep things clean and care about their guests, and I've had lousy stays at expensive places because they don't do these things. Aria falls somewhere in between.\n\nActually no, Aria falls on the lower end of the spectrum.\n\nThe non-hotel parts are great. The restaurants are nice and overpriced as expected, the casino is lovely, the shops are overpriced as expected, etc. If I didn't actually stay there, I probably would have given it 4 stars.\n\nHowever, the room quality was lousy. First off, there was a big section of peeling wallpaper in the corridor leading to my room. Really? Tape or glue would solve that until it could be properly fixed. I'm shocked that a hotel would allow that to be in the guests' sight, especially when it tries to market itself as luxurious.\n\nThe room itself was \""meh\"" at best. The bedside tablet to control the room is such a gimmicky joke, and might have been slightly impressive 12 years ago. It's a slow, laggy system with a lousy user interface, and it's completely asinine to use something such as this for simple functions such as changing the channel on the TV or turning the lights on or off. Unfortunately I was stuck using it to change the TV channels because the remote was dead. Speaking of dead, so was the minibar. It was maybe a few degrees below room temperature at the most. If you're going to use convenience to tempt me with soda, sparkling water, and various alcohols at 500% of retail, they at least need to be nice and cold.\n\nI ordered room service exactly once and the food was absolutely lousy. I would have thought they could manage a decent bowl of ramen (there are world-class ramen houses literally within a few miles of this hotel, so people around here should know what it's supposed to taste like) and it was beyond disappointing.\n\nThe kicker is that my opinions are this low when it didn't cost me a dime. Corporate expense account for the lot of it. Had I been actually paying to stay here, I would have checked out within a couple hours of check-in. I can literally say it's barely worth staying here for free. It seems like if you want to drop the cash for one of their upper level suites you can have a great experience, but after this initial experience I'm not going to give them the chance when I come back for pleasure instead of business.\n\nTo be fair, the Aria did stand out for me in one area, and one area alone: the staff. Everyone I interacted with, from the front desk to the waitstaff to housekeeping to the valets, concierge, casino staff, convention area staff, etc. were all pleasant and professional. The staff are the only reason why this place gets a generous two stars instead of one."
1,"I came in town for the week and stopped by this Coffee Bean location. I love the location at an outdoor mall. Coffee Bean is hands down better than Starbucks. I always stop at one when in CA or AZ. I love the Ultimate Mocha blended drink with coffee beans. This is similar to the Java chip at Starbucks but it taste so much better then at Starbucks. So if your in town, I recommend paying this location a visit and enjoy their coffee. At the same time catch a movie or shop while your here. I wish they would have more locations in Texas."
0,"This place is horrible! I've been getting my nails done for years and this was the worst experience I have ever had! First, there were two people working they sat the three of us in boiling hot water for pedicures, didnt ask how the water was and left us for 30 mins. Finally the two started on two of us, my mother in law never had a pedicure before and 6 mins in to hers the lady left and did an entire manicure on her friend that walked in. Who does that? Thats the worst thing you can do in customer service!! When the lady came back to finish, 20 minutes later she didnt apologize or anything! The lady finished mine, without a foot or leg massage and went to my husband with the same tools she used on me!! Gross!!! When I asked her to remove my gel on my fingernails she told she didnt have the time and I could do it myself! Rude!! This place is dirty and has the worst customer service ever! They should've paid me to sit there and deal with the rudeness and crappy service we got!"
1,"With my relatively new vegetarian preferences, I'll try just about any restaurant with tempeh on the menu. Aux Vivres rewarded me nicely.\n\nGreat rice bowls, sandwiches, smoothies, and desserts! Food portions were just right for me. I loved the BLT, buddha bowl, thai bowl, bombay banana, mango lassi, and chocolate smoothie. Food disappointments were the veggie lox sandwich (done well but not something I would normally crave) and the cafe frappe (the flavor wasn't quite right for some reason; maybe too much soy milk).\n\nDuring my recent vacation in Montreal, I sat at various times at the counter, in the dining room, and on the terrace. I visited for both lunch and dinner, and never had to wait, although the dining room was often near capacity. The interior of the restaurant is nice, although the layout is quirky, and one of our tables was right below an air conditioner that gave us the chills. The servers were almost consistently friendly, and service was quick."
1,HUGE portions!  Food was very good as well!  One of the better BBQ places in town!
1,Its been hard to find authentic Thai here in Scottsdale but I love Thai Basil - The tom yum soup and Pad thai are both delicious and appropriately spicy - Im averaging once a week since I discovered it!
1,"We just had to come back cause the original experience was so good. We both did the Saturday Build A Burger. Hubby got green chilies, I got green chilies with cheddar cheese. Both yummy, but ya know what, these burgers are sooooooo good they stand alone! !! No need for any garnish, just perfect plain. Most of the time,  I order garnish on the side because the burgers are just not that great and I need the add ons.  But, boy, these burgers are big, juicy, seared on outside and perfect -- best word for them -- perfect.\n\nOrdered the sweet potato fries cause of all the Yelp recommendations. Boy, am I ever glad!!! Great dusting of salt with chili powder for a subtle bite, but pair that with the Thai Sweet Chili sauce and WOW! !! Best ever!!!\n\nWe're going for the Bread Pudding for dessert, so hold on for that review...\n\nWell, now,  that is bread pudding! ! Hubby just remarked, \""Oh, wow, probably the best I have had\""\n\nThere ya go... another GREAT experience at Thirteen North! !!"
1,"So yeah visited a buddy in Scottsdale and stopped into Shotgun Betty's for a few suds, great atmosphere I almost felt like it was a movie setting, drink specials and reasonable beverage prices!  It is a tad bit gimmicky but the music kicks ass and the staff is very friendly and ridiculously hot!!!  We had a good time and will stop in next time I'm in town for sure."
0,"To be fair, I gave this place one star because they have so many beers on tap. Great selection too.\n\nNow, the food was a grade above dog food and the service was awful. We stopped in here to watch the finals and our first server told us she did not want to repeat the beer list cause \""there were so many\"". Last I checked, if you work at a bar and your customer asks what kind of beer you serve, you answer cause thats your job. Would it make it easier on you if we just got up ourselves and checked? I mean come on. This server wanted to close out, so we had another chick come over, one who was more concerned with telling us how it was almost her last shift and she was moving back home than providing good service. She was not the sharpest tool in the box either.\n\nEither way, I spend my money at places I enjoy, food and service are important. I can go anywhere in this town to get beers on tap. Needless to say, I will not be going there again."
1,"Best acai bowl in Arizona! Jamba Juice acai toppers don't count...I think they blend grapes into theirs which really thins them out. Thrive makes them perfectly and uses fresh, ripe fruit. I would come here everyday but my wallet would protest. It is a bit of a splurge for a broke college student but definitely worth it. Friendly staff and great acai bowls!"
1,Best Authentic Italian in Vegas!\n\nHeard about it from friends and on Food Network.\n\nGreat atmosphere & super attentive and friendly wait staff.\n\nTheir lasagna & scampi are out of this world & on occasion they have different chefs specials from time to time. \n\nHave been 10 plus times now & looking forward to many more.
0,"Let me start with the service, it was great. My wife's steak was also wonderful, my steak was at best horrible, it had a bone in it and was 50% gristle. I visit Sullivan's quite a bit and understand that both are owned by the same company, however I will not return to this Del Frisco's"
1,"Had a rare only person in the house night, so I decided to treat myself.   \n\nI have passed by the Panda for years, and have always wanted to stop by, but my wife is very picky about Chinese food.   With only me, I had the perfect opportunity.\n\nI stopped in on the way home on Tuesday, July 3rd, to order and go.   Entered, and found really nothing to write home about the interior decor.  But I am of the mindset that if the decor is not great, the food usually is.  (long experiences with Mexican restaurants in the west)\n\nThere were several people in the front area, either waiting for their food or waiting to order.  But nobody sitting down.  It was early in the evening, though.\n\nI love General Tso's chicken, and most of the time, it is not that spicy, to appeal to a wider audience. \n\nI ordered the dinner special, which came with fried rice and an egg roll.   I could see thru to the kitchen behind the counter, and was able to watch as my food was prepared.\n\nIt came quickly, and I took it home.  As I was leaving, there were more people coming in.\n\nI got home and grabbed a beer, and got into my order.  And the General Tso's was spicy!!!  The way it should be!!\n\nIt was a generous portion, and the fried rice was flavorful.  The egg roll, well it was an egg roll, but I love egg rolls as well!\n\nBe mindful, this was just a review of one dish.  I do have to go back and try more!"
1,"Being from Los Angeles, we have so many trendy burger places popping up that use all sorts of random, fancy ingredients.  These places tend to be 'hit or miss' with me, as I never know if I am going to like their secret ingredients that make their burgers so special.  What I liked about eating at BLT Burger was that most of their selection was made up of standard ingredients that you can find at most burger places.  BLT Burger separates itself from other places by using high quality products instead of obscure ingredients to create unique, tasty flavors.  \n\nMy meal here consisted of a BLT burger and sweet potato fries.  The burger was very good.  All of the ingredients tasted fresh and very flavorful.  The sweet potato fries were a bit too shriveled, and I would have preferred for them to be chunkier.  However, they were still very good, and my wife kept raving about them.  \n\nI also noticed a lot of people ordering shakes, and I probably would have done the same if it wasn't such a cold day.  They looked amazing, and seemed to be a very popular item.  The next time I go back, I will get a shake for sure.\n\nI really enjoyed my meal at BLT Burger.  It was nice to have a really good burger with out all of the trendy hype.  I can't wait to have BLT Burger again the next time I am in Vegas!"
0,"i had thought this was going to be great really!!  had this on my TO DO list 4ever.  Finally went, on a monday. Menu indicates \""MONDAY MADNESS 1/2 glasses of wine\"". (see rvws below - monDAY - not for an hour or so). so i ended up ordering 3 glasses of wine - bill: all full price!! Was told only after 3:30. is it just me? A Happy Hr is usually 4-6 (or there-about) but monDAY is \""DAY\"", as in during the DAY.  not a happy hr (or 2) special.  (rudely told: the web indicates this - {I never looked}, the inside blackboard says - {i was OUTside!} & inside the bill  folder- {umm, it was under a survey & AFTER my bill arrived???})\n\nFLATbread was THICK, like reg. pizza, & had 1/2 cup of canned parm. cheese all over = can u say: dry, boring, mundane?\n\nbread STICKS were huge, thick, doughy things  - my kids make ones from pillsbery dough which tasted same.  These were size of croissants, certainly not sticks - never seen any breadsticks that remotely resemble these in my life.  Should be called Pilsbery Dough Plate Special - i swear that's exactly what it was.\n\nI seriously hate to provide a review like this, not to mention a confrontation which ensued when my bill arrived, but it was awful.  I could write many more upsetting details which occurred, but i won't - it would be petty.  Suffice to say I couldn't seriously think on going back.\n(i should  point out that eventually i did recieve the 3 glasses at 1/2 off, but the bill did not reflect any break on the 'flatbread' not 'breadsticks')"
0,The staff here was friendly but the food was sub par. There were a lot of weird twist to the breakfast plates that weren't explained on the menu when you order. Pancakes were probably the highlight on this menu after trying the spot out 4 different times.
0,"Eh...so so.  Service was speedy but...they are running so fast they're doing sort of drive by service so you can't get their attention if you need something, and there were a number of things I would have asked for. Won ton soup made with water not broth.  Won tons weren't wrapped properly so they fell apart and veggies were far too crispy in the soup.  They didn't serve it in a proper little bowl with a Chinese soup spoon.  It was a regular old American soup spoon.  Not fun.  They wrapped the moo shu pork for you, and then gave you sauce to dip it in which takes all the fun out of wrapping it yourself.  The plum sauce was so salty it was not enjoyable.  I needed a gallon of water to drink after a few bites of that, but I couldn't get a server to stop running past my table.  No tea offered to start???    I saw a couple drinking tea out of coffee mugs.  That is just WRONG! at a Chinese restaurant.  I don't recommend Flo's."
0,"I stumbled upon this place when it first opened up in Dec. 2008, then I tried to come here again. \n\n-- decor -- decent, chic\n-- convenience -- I don't see how anyone can find it, given that you'd have to walk a really long distance from the Palm casino to get here, plus, other than the ppl who stay here in at \""Palms Place\"", almost nobody knows about this lounge. \n\n-- deserted the nights I visited, but it's cool if you are into the privacy."
0,"I came here on a Sunday afternoon. It was moderately busy. The price was OK, $9 for my meal. But I think the experience could have been better.\n\nFood: Pork and beans with sauerkraut. Flavor was good, but not very spicy and heavy on the BBQ. - 3.5 stars\n\nService: Slow, they unapologetically forgot my order - 1 star."
0,"The casino is very nice as is the pool. The dealers are friendly and inviting. The hotel on the other hand was sub par. The room smelled of stale smoke even though it was a no smoking room, the hallway constantly reeked like cheap cologne, there were no amenities in the room such as a fridge or coffee maker and the ac turned on and off every 5 seconds. The room never reached a cool temperature. I recommend playing here but not staying here."
0,"A month later, a Manager called me from Mastro's, apologized, and informed me that they updated their music.   He told me he was sending me a coupon or voucher, to make up for the bad experience and bad food, but 3 WEEKS LATER HAVE NOT RECEIVED ANYTHING.  City Hall again, has dropped the ball."
1,"Bobby Flay ROCKS.  I had the New Mexican Spice Rubbed Pork Tenderloin, with bourbon ancho chile sauce and sweet potato tamale with crushed pecan butter, which was AWESOME.  This entree also comes with another side, which rotates.  When I first had it, the dinner came with roasted kernel corn with Cojita cheese and a squeeze of lime.  It all was so, soo good. \n\nAll the food is fantastic.  Great atmosphere.  It's a little expensive, and \""proper dress\"" is required.  (Ex -  they made me remove my baseball cap, or I wouldn't be seated.)\n\nLetter grade:  A"
1,"I've been going to Showboy for quite awhile & I really don't have anything bad to say! They definitely have the best cupcakes in Vegas and their custom cakes are nothing short of amazing. I've had 2 custom cakes done for kids birthdays; in both cases, I've been supremely impressed at the value - amazing work for very reasonable prices. In general, the frosting are not over sweet and compliment the fluffy delicious cakes quite well. My favorite flavors - the Pinup (cherry cola), the Big Top (orange sherbet) and the salted caramel. Anything chocolate is deep and decadent."
0,"My husband and I wanted to eat soul food while in Vegas, so I found this place and ate there on Tuesday night.  I guess there is a difference between soul food and southern cuisine. \n\nWe were expecting a soulful joint filled with soulful people. The place was PACKED! But only a handful of Black folks were there.  The \""blues\"" singer was some young hippy-looking kid, backing him was a brotha playing guitar and another brotha playing the drums.  The \""blues\"" singing was so DANG....LOUD it was crazy!  We looked around and the people were hee-hawing.  \n\nThe service was slow as a snail.  The waitress was very kind, but we waited over 20 minutes before we acknowledged at the table. \n\nI ordered a catfish po boy sandwich.  My husband ordered fried chicken with white gravy  (YUCK!!!) over white mac and cheese (YUCK!!!) and we shared a bowl of collard greens.  \n\nThe sandwich was suppose to be on a toasted hoggie bread and fries.  The bread was cold and dry, the catfish were those cheap-azz nuggets, slices of tomatoes and a piece of lettuce leaf. How do you put the round nuggets on the bread?  A palm size of fries. $17.99  \n\nChicken tasted good minus the gravy and mac and cheese.  The noodles were too thick to be used for mac and cheese.  You must have sharp cheddar cheese (orange)  in mac and cheese, not some mild white cheese.\n$17.99\n\nCollards were seasoned with bacon and that's all!  No garlic, no seasoned salt or vinegar. And it was COLD! $6.99\n\nDon't even ask me about the drinks, what a JOKE!!!\n\nThe dessert menu didn't have any pound cake, sweet potato pie, buttermilk pie, cobbler; none of that true southern cuisine-soul food.\n\nMy husband asked the waitress were there any Black American ole' school cooks in the kitchen?.  She said, \""Yes, two\"".  He then said, \""There is no way they cooked this food.  It is TERRIBLE!\"" \n\nI know soul food.  I create soul food and I grew up on soul food and THAT is NOT soul food! YUCK!!!!!\n\nIT IS OVERPRICED TOO!!!  $77\n\n\n\nOh! we didn't know until later that \""BB King's Blues Club\"" is NOT..NOT..NOT his club!  They just have his permission to use his name.  That's how they get so many people to patronize that place."
0,"Unfortunately I am unable to comment as far as actual LASIK because Schwartz Laser Eye Center canceled my appointment one week before I scheduled to fly in for the eye evaluation and surgery.  If you are thinking about flying in from out of town to visit Schwartz, I do not recommend it.\n\nI live in Los Angeles, and decided to have LASIK in Phoenix because I have family out there who could drive me to and from both appointments.  I booked a flight, took time off of work, and had a family remember request both days off of work so they could drive me to the appointments.  I received a call yesterday that they needed to reschedule because Dr. Schwartz was going out of town.  I reminded them that I am specifically flying in for this appointment (and she even confirmed this information was in my file... meaning, they knew about this prior to calling me), but the receptionist just said \""I know, we are really frustrated too.\""  Right, but the receptionist didn't just waste a couple hundred dollars on a flight and ask family members to take time off work.  \n\nTo top it off, I received both a text message and an email this morning confirming my appointment for next week.  Call me crazy, but if you are going to cancel appointments last minute, you probably don't want to send out confirmations directly afterward.  \n\nI'm shocked at the level of customer service I received from a doctor that is in the business of performing elective surgery (that can cost upwards of $5,000!).  It seems as though other people have had great experiences with Schwartz... I just wish I could've been one of them."
0,"This is a pretty bad...okay a really bad Indian restaurant.  It was a horrible experience, I don't even know where to start.  The food was bad, the server had no knowledge of what was on the menu and the interior was like a fast food restaurant. Plus...being from the south I'm not knocking a southern accent, but I don't want my server to say \""hey y'all what's in this dish?\"""
1,"First off going into the restaurant its your typical hole in the wall small Pho shop. Greasy floors, funky lighting, and the TV on some random channel that no one but the owners are watching. It's to be expected and only adds to the experience.\n\nPrice of the bowls was cheaper than I expected so that makes up for the pricey sides. Now here is my biggest gripe with most pho restaurants in Arizona and for the price of the bowl you don't get the quantity that makes California a haven for pho. Especially since Arizona is competing with those half off pho specials in Garden Grove. However, I was pleasantly surprised when my Pho Xe Lua was actually a train. Most other places in Arizona I'm usually not full after one bowl but here I was starting struggle near the end. A bittersweet surprise at best. \n\nWith the exception of the meatballs, the rest of the pho bowl was bland. The broth was a little too \""mn\"" as they say in the Vietnamese language. The beef was a little too rough for me and wasn't as flavorful and the rest of the bowl seemed out of balance too much tripe or too little meatballs, my OCD self had problems trying to get even proportions of meat throughout the meal. \n\n\nTl;dr\n\nQuantity greater than Quality at Pho Nhat"
0,Terrible service. Never anyone around to help. Food was just ok  fries soggy. Took 10 minutes to get mustard for out burgers. Beers were flat.  Will never come back. So many other great places in Pittsburgh. This place is a complete waste of your time
1,"This is the best deal around.  I've never had a bad massage/masseur!! For $25, you truly get a relaxing, therapeutic massage.  Everytime I go when I have major stress or kinks in my back or neck, this place 'cures' it!  I sent my parents when they were in town, and as skeptical as they were (seemed too cheap), they walked away totally happy.  It's clean, quiet and they know what they're doing."
0,"Food was great,  Service not so great.  \n\nHad to eat in the bar as they did not have any tables available due to reservations supposedly.  However, the tables still were nowhere near full when we left.  Waitress was lost half of the time and so I just gave another one my card to pay the tab.  Looked at the receipt later when I got home and realized the prices in the menu were different than the prices on the receipt.\n\nThis is basically my fault for not checking but at the same time if the waitress was not so busy I would not felt like it was going to take forever to get the bill and get out of here and just gave them my card.\n\nI ate here once before and it was great but on Saturday it was less then great.  I am mixed about whether I will return.  The service is much better at Houston's and I have never had to wait for a table or eat at the bar no matter how busy they are.\n\nI should mention that the food was excellent though.\n\nThe bill came to ~$100 with tip for dinner for two\n\nMight recommend others to try it but make sure you check your bill unlike me. Its about principle not the cost of the item."
1,"I LOVE Glass Nickel pizza. Is it the \""best pizza in Madison\""? I say almost. The Thai Pie is my absolute favorite - it has a peanut sauce with mozzarella over it along with peppers, chicken, and broccoli. It's amazing.  In fact, most of their specialty pizzas are freaking delicious and you cannot go wrong with them. (My second favorites are the Fetalicious, Veg Out, and Alfredo Pizzas) I also adore the fried macaroni and cheese.  It's 9 parts tasty, and 1 part \""omg, I'm eating fried macaroni and cheese and I'm going to have a heart attack at 40.\"""
0,"AVOID!! AVOID!!  IF YOU WANT TO BE FOOD POISONED, GO HERE!! AVOID! AVOID!\n\nFirst of all the female manager is an absolute JERK!  She has an attitude of arrogance with a side of rudeness!! Wonderful combination!\n\nI've been going to Jamba Juice in ALL locations including California and have NEVER experienced ANYTHING like what I experienced here!\n\nEvery time I've ordered an extra boost of whey or soy protein and another \""free boost\"" they offer, IF the drink is made correctly and with the FULL INGREDIENTS, there is ALWAYS too much drink for the cup you ordered so the server automatically gives you the bigger cup to hold all the extra... WHEN I'M PAYING ALMOST $5 FOR A SIXTEEN OUNCE DRINK, YOU BETTER BELIEVE I WANT ALL THAT I PAID FOR!!!\n\nThere have been times that I've had to ask the \""newer\"" servers to put into a larger cup but for the most part, HAVE NEVER HAD A PROBLEM WITH THIS except when I went to the GREENFIELD / MCKELLIPS Jamba Juice and had to deal with this manager.\n\nShe actually INSISTED that any drink left in the mixer was Jamba Juice's and not the customer!!  She REFUSED to place all of the drink in the larger cup. I have gone round and round with this manager moron at least 5-6 times AND obviously the \""customer is always right\"" doesn't apply here!  \n\nI finally got fed up and told her I went to the Jamba Juice on Gilbert / University and talked to them and they just shrugged, saying, \""We always give the customer a bigger cup... they've paid extra, so we feel it's theirs. We don't quite understand why this manager is doing this, but that store is a separate franchise and are probably not following the Jamba Juice way.\""\n\nI went back on Saturday and there the manager was at the cash register. When she saw me, she immediately turned and went to the back room and didn't come back. Another server had to come off the mixing line and as she walked to the cash register to help me, looked through the door window of the office (I could tell she was puzzled as to why the manager abruptly left).  I ordered and did my spiel about putting the extra in the larger cup and she nodded.\n\nAt the same time about 10 people came into the store and got in line to order and immediately the manager came out to wait on them... hmmm, I wonder if it is me?\n\nI watched the gal make my drink and she placed it into the mixer.  I turned away and looked out the window to check my son who was in the car and as I turned around, I saw the manager putting a scoop of white powder into my drink and then she started the mixer again.  I was STUNNED!!  I started to say, \""What are you doing?\"" and she immediately went back into the back room again.  I got really angry and said, \""What is going on?... Why would she put that powder in my drink?  What is the powder substance?\"" \n\nThe gal that waited on me stated she was going to find out & went into the back room and came out a minute later.  She said, \""the manager said you always want whey protein and she saw that I put soy protein in you drink and made it wrong.\""  I very agitated at this point, exclaimed, \""So instead of making me a NEW drink, you sabotage my juice with TOO MUCH protein and make it taste like CRAP!!?!!\""\n\nBy this time everyone in the place was just trying to figure out what was going on with this manager... I said in a very loud voice that I was leaving and I was going to contact the corporate offices as well as the HEALTH DEPARTMENT!!  Obviously I left WITHOUT my poisoned drink nor an offer of getting my money back!\n\nAt the very least this manager needs to be fired and have since learned that what she did with my drink can be a felony... how do I know what this white powder was that she put in my drink?  This CRAZY, WHACKED OUT Manager MORON needs to be behind bars and have her food handlers card REVOKED immediately!!\n\nI contacted the corporate office and they called me and said they were sending a \""team\"" to investigate this situation right away.  I filled out a formal written complaint with the health department as well as contacting the City of Mesa Police Department for attempted poisoning.  She needs to be in jail!"
0,"Divine Eatery is a new spot that's basically within walking distance for a lot of people in Providence. For starters, the \""decor\"" in here is super weird. I think they tried way too hard to be trendy and it comes off tacky. Every chair and table in the place is different, almost like someone went around to yard sales and got the cheapest kitchen furniture they could find. My chair was wobbly so I know it wasn't new stuff. Besides that, the walls are also completely bare...no pictures, art, signs, nothing! \n\nTheir menu is also a little on the weird side. It's very limited and the way it's typed up is awkward. And the food doesn't save this place either. I went with the Divine Throwback which is basically just a pancake and two egg breakfast priced at $10! The pancakes were bland and tough, I could barely cut them with my fork. For some reason they add powdered sugar to them but barely any at that, so it adds no flavor. The rest was just basic stuff anyone can make at home, but make better. My meal also included burnt bacon and unseasoned home fries...Yum! My son got chocolate chip pancakes which were ok but only cause they had chocolate in them. Basically the pancakes don't even stand out against regular boxed pancake mix. \n\nI'm not sure how this place will stay in business other than being the only breakfast spot that is so close to all those homes. They don't offer anything unique and it's overpriced. $3 for sodas and iced tea...we're not in downtown LV here! The service was decent but that's not hard to accomplish with only two tables at 10am. There's plenty of other breakfast spots less than 10 minutes away...I'll pick one of those next time!"
0,"TRAINWRECK!!! \nProof positive that it ISN\""T just Location! Location! Location! \nWhile Koi has an excellent home at the heart of the strip...\n The ambiance is dark, the management are non-existent, and the food is sub par and completely overpriced. The only saving grace was that the drinks were strong and the staff were all to eager to give away cocktails for free as compensation for their ineptitude and/ or indifference. For such an empty restaurant, one might expect reasonable service and fresh food. However, our oysters smelled rancid and steaks were unrested with blood mixing into the sauce all over our plates. Eeeeewwwwww! \n  Our server was inattentive and our attempts to have our issues addressed by the arrogant asian manager walking around casually were abandoned when someone from our party finally caught a glimpse of him, sitting by himself at a table in the dining room and staring at his iphone for no less than 15 minutes. Pathetic! While we stared at inedible food he never made it over to ours or anyone else's table to check on their experience... At least we all got a good laugh, after our free drinks, at how little anyone really seemed to care that we were there to exchange our hard earned money for a meal... what a unique concept-\n  Ultimately we wrote the experience off as a total loss and won't be back to Koi any time soon. Hopefully they get their S#@! together and remember they are in the service industry. Times are tough and you aren't exactly exceeding anyones expectations. I've never been in a more underperforming and empty restaurant on the strip. A new low..."
0,"Very beautiful! was such a gorgeous place the view was a widescreen HD version of Pittsburgh point with the ducky in the river at the time I went. There was live pianist and singer that was just great. It was so pretty and formal like something right out of the titanic. I was pretty on edge I suspected my BF would purpose to me on this night at this restaurant which later I found to be pretty cookie cutter for Pittsburgh and lacking originality. It was really a great time but I haven't gone back we have since split and it taints the place for me unfortunately because my other half knows as do I that I got engaged here lol. \n\nOther then the obvious reason for not returning lets point out the positives. Great lighting. Nice wait staff, clean presentable and possibly the best view of Pittsburgh EVER. I got a Caesar salad which the waiter made table side and I got to ask questions about anchovies paste and what he was adding in our dressing. The salad had an acquired taste but still pretty good. I got a filet with mash and carrots. The meal was great is wasn't super over flavored which allowed me to taste the quality of the beef. The meat was much better then other places in the burgh and its wasn't too expensive. The night ending bill for apps, salads, diner and dessert was only near 100 and in the end they served me with a plate, plated with a diamond ring strawberry syrup in the shape of a question mark. They were really helpful helping the ex plan and definitely could tell it was something they were used to doing but i couldn't help but feel i was just another piece of meat on their engagement assembly line. I wish the location hadn't been tainted with a failed engagement cause they are a decently priced night out for any occasion or celebration, im not saying its cheap enough to invite other guest but i would definitely recommend this place for quiet romantic dates especially at night. Just if you plan to propose do it else where, I found when i was telling my engagement story to those who asked I heard comments such as how cliche, or how original, or gee-sh who hasn't got engaged there? Don't get me wrong it was great but give your gal a creative and love felt engagement stay away from going with the grain. MAKE IT SPECIAL. Make this the anniversary spot instead lol. I do agree that below food is kinda bland and mediocre for the price."
0,I am only commenting on the brunch.  It's very pricey given the very limited selection and the quality mediocre at best.  The pastries are pre-packaged and the bacon is way over done.  It was actually burnt. Stay away for the brunch.  I can't speak for the other meals

0,"The service was ok. Host took his sweet time coming to us at the front, even though they were lot busy at all. Our waitress was attentive for the most part. However, the food was a mix of bad and \""whatever\"" for me. The appetizer sampler we all shared was good. Everything seemed fresh and tasted how id expected. However my main course and dessert were not to standard. While my chorizo omelette was a lot bigger than pictured in the menu, the spice was completely missing from the dish. Instead the sausage tasted supremely over seasoned, so salty that i barely touched it. My strawberry and creme crepe was not cooked right. It tasted like a slightly thin pancake, rather than a papery \""melt in your mouth soft\"" crepe and again was over seasoned with the strawberry glaze. It too was barely touched. Overall, not a good dining experience."
1,"Parc Laurier is either my favourite or second favourite park in the city. Big leafy, shady trees in the summer keep this ginger from burning to a crisp, but also a tiny skating area in the Winter to keep me entertained...this park truly has a bit of everything. The swimming pool is lovely (and freaking cold!), the grass areas are plentiful, the public washrooms are decent and close and helloooo, there are ping pong tables, niiiiice. People BBQ, drink wine and act their age here; now that's a great Montreal park!"
1,"I haven't actually purchased a car at this particular Carmax, but I have come here on several occasions with others who have been in the market for cars. I actually really like the Carmax experience. The worst part about car shopping to me is negotiating on price. That's what I like about Carmax. You walk in and you're free to browse the inventory at your leisure and there are salespeople ready to help whenever you need them. Each time I've come here shopping with friends the sales associates have been friendly, helpful and most importantly... patient.\n\nThey have a big inventory and what's even better if there is a vehicle at another Carmax across the nation they can get that to your local dealership if you request it. Within 250 miles there is no cost and they charge a service fee for any that are at dealerships that are a little further from your current location. \n\nThe web site is pretty easy to navigate as well. You can keep an eye out for the car you've got your eye out for or even set up alerts for a particular year, make and or model that you are looking for and they will let you know when it's available. Definitely the way I like to car shop."
0,"The steaks once received were for the most part great if the waitress was listening on the order. In our group of seven she apparently checked out on three of the orders. Outside of that if you have either a flare gun or road side flares then use them as that apparently is the only way to get service from the wait staff. \n\nOne of our group did snag an employee passing by and asked if we could have our sides served to stave of delirium from hunger due to the pro-longed delay. No dice... Instead we got a kid in a suit advising us to not to \""fill up on bread...\"" As our waitress shouted problems at him that we had brought up earlier.\n\nSteaks = great\nExperience = bad\nWait staff = terrible\nManagement = Pretentious... & covering for deficiencies!"
0,"I am not a nightclub person, but somehow I ended up at this outrageously expensive stink hole. \n\nI could and will never, ever justify paying this much to stand around and sip cocktails with a bunch of well-off snoots. Buy stocks, help the homeless, go back to school, whatever... just do something other than waste your paycheck at this trendy club.\n\nThe only redeeming quality is the outdoor space, which is set up quite nicely. There's a pool in the middle and I was really hoping that some smug butthole would get pushed into it. Alas, he or she did not, therefore keeping this review at one star. \n\nWho wants to spend thousands of dollars on a \""cabana\"" when I can have the same private experience in my parent's basement? Invite some friends over and blast some techno... done. At least I wouldn't have money hungry hoes preying on my overpriced bottles of mediocre liquor.\n\nAvoid da club and go to the Pinball Hall of Fame instead. It's open late too."
0,"HORRIBLE customer service. Scheduled an anniversary dinner here, and was flummoxed when I tried to let them know we'd be running a bit late (15 minutes), as it was an unusual rain storm that had snarled traffic. First, the woman who answered the phone couldn't seem to find the reservation. Second, the fifteen minute grace period was obviously not okay with her. I was told the only other available time was three hours later. When I told her that we could either be there, but fifteen minutes late, or not come at all, she opted to accept that we wouldn't be coming and spending money there. What??! I mean, not everyone can have TOP CHEF money, but still. Craftsteak is not in need of building a client base? Give me a break. Clearly, the customer service of Tom Colicchio's staff is non-existant. Instead, hubris and bitchiness prevail -- almost like TOP CHEF itself."
0,"Passable, but didn't appreciate having the back employee service entrance as the only way into the hotel. (I guess some unfortunate person died from a slab of concrete falling on them in the front entrance). \n Pros: location, and pretty decent breakfast\n\nCons: Breakfast room  way to small to accomodate the amount of guest they have. ( the german tourist didn't understand the concept of waiting their turn).  Felt like an employee walkin thru service corridor everyday."
1,"Banana nut muffin is moist with a great crust. They dont skimp on the canadian bacon when it comes to the eggs florentine benedict.  Hollandaise was on point; not too much salt and is not too creamy, complementing the egg yolk. Potatoes were seasoned perfectly, although they could have been crispier. Had a bite of the chili relleno, overriding flavor was the chili, which is a plus. Coffee left me wanting, but we were there for the eggs!\n\nGreat service, no wait to get in, overall great place to have breakfast off the strip."

I've always been kinda iffy about the places around here since it's kinda sketchy, but surprisingly this bakery is another one of those awesome hole-in-the-wall type of places. \n\nWhen I first walked in, I felt as though the inside was kinda crammed since there's such little space between the display case and front windows. When I opened the door, I think I almost hit the cash register. Now that I think if it, just imagine yourself in some tinny NY bakery in the middle of city. And after reading Galdi G.'s review he sure did create the atmosphere of just that. However, this place has a huge selection of pastries, cookies, etc to choose from. The other reviews made it seem like they are more Italian oriented, which is what I was I expecting. From what it looked like, it felt like their selections were more Hispanic influenced? The style they present their products and the baking techniques? I've always thought I had a good grasp on my pin pointing the ethnic background of desserts, but this place kinda caught me off guard. \n\nNone the less, I only bought an eclair just to get the feel for this place. It was absolutely delicious (nice homemade taste). Probably the best eclair I ever had. The texture of the cream inside was absolutely amazing. Highly recommend buying tit or even giving it to others. The overall dessert wasn't too sweet. Must come back here try to their other products."
0,"Basic Burger patty was frozen (medium well was gray and hot, but still squishy. Know what I mean?).  Stopped in between flights at 7pm. Fries were cold. Come on, guys!!  I'll gladly pay, especially when trapped in an airport, an extra buck for hot fries. Throw them out, for Pete's sake, when they time out!  But the beer was good (can't mess that up) and the view against the window of ground ops at C6 is worth it!  So go, but pay for the premium patty."
1,"USAA is the best of the best of the best. I'm not kidding. They know what they're doing Everything from their website navigation, user friendly online banking, and their SUPERB customer service. \""Really?\"" \""Superb.\"" \""Keep it up.\"" \""Superb.\"" \""Say it again.\"" \""Superb.\""\n\nWell, Empire Records quote out of the way, I have been with USAA ever since... forever. I was grandfathered in under my Dad who is a retired USAF Lt. Colonel. Actually, I first started dealing with them directly when I opened my first Master Card as an 18 year old before moving out and going to college. And then soon after I dealt with USAA's customer service line numerous times because my car loan and car insurance are through them.\n\nWhenever I called them about anything their customer service representatives have been angels. I say they've been angels because compared to other customer service reps at other companies I've spoken to these people have to be from another plane of existence to consistently be so amazing. I've called crying because I locked my keys in my car, or just confused over something having to do with registering my car and not being able to get my proof of insurance printed out in enough time (gee, the wonders of a irresponsible teenage college student). But every time they have been great. Going on 9 years now they have never let me down.\n\nAs soon as I snag myself a full time job I am moving my checking account over to USAA. They offer direct deposit and deposit from home. They also offer a set amount of money to be returned to your bank account at the end of every month if you happen to take out money at one of those nasty ATMs that charge you an arm and a leg for use. I hate that and knowing I could get that money back would be awesome. \n\nMy plan is to be with USAA forever. I have no reason to switch to anyone else. They've been in my family for a long time. My parents, me, my brother, and sister have all been with them for some reason or another and they have never done us wrong."
0,"When the owner of the franchise has the customer service skills of an angry ape, it's no suprise fellow yelpers are down on this place. Purchased food through the drive through a while back and the order was filled incorrectly. So went back to the store, and after dealing with the manager just wanted a refund. He refused to provide a refund because he said we were rude. Ended up leaving food at the counter and walking out the store. Not worth the time, maybe Dickie's corporate will take it back."
0,"Came here to have a good night with friends and family, after what was supposed to be a relaxing evening, turned into an ordeal. I previously won a $50 gift card from a charity event supporting a young child needing a transplant. When I went to use this gift card, the manager came out and said this card is not valid since I could not produce a receipt for the said purchased card that was won from a raffle. Even after I showed him the legitimate raffle event's website and contacted the event staffs coordinator, the card was only honored for half the valued price. The manager even admitted that there was record of the card being activated in their system and yet would not honor it. Over all I do not plan on making a return."
1,"I think triangle hoagies are great for parties and tailgates.  I normally order one or two battleships and all the fixings.  They are huge, they are reasonably prices, they are prepared quickly, and they are delicious!  I definitely will be back for more soon!"
0,"I used to frequent the Urban Tea Loft!  I adore the Chai Teatini--it's amazing, and their amaretto black tea is to die for.  The food is average (nothing special), but the atmosphere is chic and lively and I've always liked being there. Unfortunately, the terrible service will prevent me from going anymore. The service was not just bad on one off-day-- it's been maddeningly slow and extremely inattentive EVERY time I've been there. It never takes less than 20 minutes to get your meal, and I've never been offered a drink refill or a dessert option by ANY server prior to them just bringing the check out. The servers also seem to routinely have friends in the restaurant that they sit down and chat with for great lengths of time rather than attending to their tables. I dunno, maybe we've just caught them on bad days the past 7 or 8 times we've been there, but 7 or 8 bad experiences is way too many and I will not be returning to or recommending the UTL to others."
1,We have been trying to find a decent Pho place by our side of town instead of having to drive alllllll the way to Chinatown.  So....we finally found this place! Food was good-can't complain. The service and atmosphere was good. The Bon Bo Hue here is the best I had in Vegas so far.
0,"Service was ok and food wasn't any better.  The Orange chicken was ok, however the egg drop soup and fried rice left a lot to be desired.  Price is pretty good for a big lunch.  I don't think I'll be returning."
1,"Very consistent, good food, service, and atmosphere. The only thing not consistent are the hatch chilies, which is understandable because they come in and out of season, but when they're hot, they're HOT! Favorites are the hatch chili especial and roswell tacos."
1,"I simply cannot imagine the reviewers that give Joel Robuchon's restaurant in Vegas anything but five stars have any real experience with fine dining. I have eaten a wide range of Michelin starred restaurants and NOTHING compares to Joel Robuchon's brilliant cuisine. Days later, my better half and I were still discussing the foie gras appetizer and the veal cheek main course. And the bread cart... oh, the bread cart.... really, you just have to see it to believe it. It will change your life, seriously.\n\nThe service was also impeccable--timely, yet never intrusive, and the sommelier went out of her way to provide us with a pile of information. \n\nOverall, this dinning experience was nothing short of masterful."
1,"This place is over the charts in my book! I was in Vegas the latter part of April 2011 for a trade show and between the constant walking, classes, and an already aggravated shoulder, I was in pain and miserable by the last day of the event. I woke up in the morning and decided to book an afternoon reservation for a deep tissue massage and epicuren pedicure to finish out my week. I wasn't sure what to expect but from the get-go, I felt like they took care of me. They courteously called me back a few times to coordinate my schedule despite the fact that my morning was crazy and kept forgetting to get back to them. They picked me up from the convention center and returned me safe and rejuvenated to my resort. The deep tissue massage was incredible! It was an experience that helped to relieve so much of the tension and pain that I had been dealing with all week. The pedicure that followed was equally indulgent and as I write this, my nail polish from that pedi OVER A MONTH AGO is still intact in comparison to the usual paint job I get from my local salon. The owner(?) was the one who returned me to my resort and if you're reading this, I am so deeply appreciative to the thoughtful care your staff showed me. I plan to come back when I head back to Vegas in a week and I am so looking forward to a fresh pedi! Did I say INCREDIBLE! Oh yeah!!!"
1,"Great coffee, friendly staff, free Wi-Fi. A really interesting selection of breakfast and lunch items. Their loyalty card is also very generous - money spent quickly adds up to free items. Good place to study or meet up with friends. Highly recommend!"
0,"Ordered rolled tacos and a Carne Asada burrito.... For a -berto restaurant, it's really not very good.  Tasteless, cold, and unimpressive."
1,"I am a monthly covered parker at this location.  The rates are quite high ($80/month) but being that I'm on the road 6 days a week sometimes (I'm a flight attendant) its the best deal of any place around.  The drivers are always quite friendly and will pick you up and drop you off right at your car.   The shuttles are usually right there to pick you up on your way into the airport, though they are a little slower going back to your car.  (though going to catch your flight is really when you need punctuality so it's no big deal.)\n\nNot sure how the daily rates work, but as often as I travel, this place is the best around."
0,"Food FAIL.\nBartender FAIL.\nEntertainment - eh.\n\nThe only reason I came here was because our friend coordinated our group of 25 and this venue accommodates larger parties because of their bench style seating. However, the food is mediocre and overpriced, the service was just okay, and the sound system was poorly monitored and difficult to hear what the emcee was saying during their random contests. \n\nFirst I arrived early hoping to catch a hockey game at the bar. I called ahead and a host said there were two screens and it looked like one was showing hockey. Joe the bartender was thoroughly inattentive, slow at pouring (hampered by bottle regulators), and indifferent to my needs. He never said hello when I sat down, never offered a menu or drink list. They only have 3 types of beers, and you can only get certain beers in certain sizes. After 10-15 minutes of waiting, Joe tried searching for the game but it was very clear that he had little experience with a remote control or his bar's service.  Plus having only one bartender at 7pm on a Saturday night didn't help him either. They use Dish service and couldn't find the game. Bar FAIL.\n\nThey sat us in the main hall near the band and the band was okay. But why had a drum set on stage if you're not going to have a drummer? Band FAIL. I could barely understand the emcee when he spoke because of either the acoustics of the room or the mic or where we were seated but it just made for a noisy atmosphere.\n\nThey've got a gal that walks around selling shots of Jager and paddle whacks on the ass. Having never been in a fraternity, I can't see how either of those can be pleasurable in any way. Plus, this lady was pissed about something someone said or did because she was putting out a really angry vibe to a couple of other guests not at our party. \n\nI don't eat pork so my menu selections were limited. I went for the chicken with mushrooms. Good mushroom sauce, but the chicken was horribly overcooked and tough. Then it was topped with French's onions and came with their German pasta side dish. This was NOT worth $19. Food FAIL.\n\nNot recommended for visitors. There's plenty better food & dining in Vegas."
0,"Had the jerk chicken for $16.99. What a pitiful yardbird that was, extremely dry and then the green beans that went with it were not even cooked!! Margaritas defiantly helped me choke down my dinner and sleep a little better too :)"
0,"Ok... I do not understand the cult following that this place has. I grew up in Mesa and have been dragged to this place several times only to wonder \""WHY?\"" The food is ridiculously hot - not yummy hot - just hot! I like hot food but I want food that is delicious and digestable. The service sucks and the prices are a rip off."
1,"The experience booking the room started off shaky when I tried to book the room over the phone when I called them directly. They had a deal on their website that said to mention it when you called. The person in reservations had no idea and said there were no rooms available that weekend. I saw there were rooms available online. Feeling frustrated, I called the 800 number. The lady that booked the reservation not only booked the room for the weekend I wanted but gave me a great package deal which was less than the deal they had on their website. This person was so nice and accommodating, she changed my mind. So Kudos to her.\n\nWhen I booked the room, we got a free valet parking, Lakeview room upgrade. 2  breakfast vouchers and two drink vouchers at the Arabesque lounge. It was a pretty good deal.\n\nWe came to the Westin for our anniversary getaway. Its the one time of the year we get away child free for some relationship celebration and recharge time.\n\nThis hotel is beautifully decorated with a cool Moroccan theme, we were very impressed. \n\nThe front desk staff was very friendly and accommodating. \n\nOur room was beautiful! The view, Wow, it was gorgeous. You honestly think you are in another state. There is a little balcony too so you can open the door and get some fresh air.\n\nAnother thing worth mentioning is the bed. It was so damn comfortable. I laid down and didn't want to get up.  The down comforter, was great too.\n\nThe property is so beautiful. We just walked around and took all of the beauty in.\n\nAt night, they have a fire pit and two fireplaces in the courtyard area. Yes its August and hot but it was still pretty awesome. They give s'mores kits away if you want to do something that will bring you back to your childhood. A very neat touch.\n\nThey have to pools, one is for the children with waterslides and kid activities and the other is more for adults. Both beautiful pools.\n\nThey also offer some cool outdoor recreation things like stand up paddle boarding, kayaking and paddleboats.\n\nWe had the choice of kayaking or paddle boating with our deal too. We decided to try the paddle boat which was pretty cool.\n\nI can say, ALL the staff we came into contact here were very friendly. That says a lot.\n\nAll in all, we had an amazing time and will definitely be back"
0,"Not good. This place is seriously overpriced for the quality of food you get. I got a taco salad, and granted, it was filling, but it was not really very good; the lettuce was kind of wilty, the meat was chewy, and it made me feel quite ill later."
1,"its more than a casino and hotel. they have shops and restaurants inside, and club pure. serendipity is conveniently located right outside the building, so you can go downstairs and get some frozen hot chocolate!\nthe hotel is really nice inside; very spacious and classy looking. they have very comfortable mattresses and pillows so its easy to fall asleep and not miss home! pool area looks pretty too."
1,"Great location, easy in and out of the parking lot.  You either enter from Tatum Blvd. on the Southbound lane or enter from Shea Blvd. on the Westbound lane.  Great area right by PV Mall.  Coffee is great, might even be better than Starbucks.  Never tried the pastries there before so don't really know how they taste.  Will definitely go back again."
0,"Dined at Table 10 Oct 20, 2012 and was very disappointed.  The soup de jour was mushroom and was OK but was served in a bowl that had to be 20 in wide which equates to 1/18 depth so therefore soup was cold before you could take 2 bites. Lobster was not good, no taste and very mediocre,  Appetizer Smoked maple  bacon was served very in a bowl by itself with nothing to go with it....greasy and just in a bowl. Special butternut squash ravioli had very little taste.  Pasta part was very nice but the rest of the dish was just plain bland. All other foods are very spicy hot as was the bacon.   I expected food that was  prepared with more of a flare. This was like eating at some cheesy pseudo gourmet.   We started with one waiter and mid meal another waiter took over while the first was still in the restaurant....a little different?   I won't be back."
0,"Be careful when you eat in this restaurant I was order ong choy it has grass in side the food they gave me an other plate the second plate it has more grass then the first plate .and the price so expensive , never again and i recommend don't go to this place ."
1,"This place is really cool, but it has a couple problems:\n1) its right on central and we all know central is one hell of a bitch to drive, that and its hard to find\n\nand 2) it doesn't have as spansive of a menu as I would like to see.\n\nsorta 3) too dark during the day. The type of lighting's cool in the evening and night, but during the day it makes me feel like I'm doing a drug run type thing (not to to say I've done so, but its how I would imagine it)\n\nI really enjoyed the atmosphere and the music though. The staff was also very friendly."
1,"This place is great, if you want healthy mexican food and great service, you need to stop in here!\n\nIve had the Big Blue, which is huge, great if you dont have to do anything in the afternoon. I usally eat the Twice Grilled Chicken Salad, healthy portion of food.\n\nThey also have a self serve salsa bar, with hot and mild sauce and plenty of chips.\n\nAlso have a drive up curb side service, kind of like Sonic, where they bring the food out to you after a phone order. \n\nMake sure you use the punch card, 6 punches and you get $5 off your next entree. Double punches on Monday all day and Tues nights."
1,I've been here quite a few times all pre planned to see certain performers.  I must say I do like this place they book good artists it has a good feel to it.  It's not the easiest to get a drink maybe I need to be more aggressive or maybe they need to make away with the stupid under 21 division especially since the 21 under side has a better view of the stage but you can't have a drink on that side. anyway keep on booking good music and i'll keep coming
0,"It's an airport, they all suck....  That is all."
1,This place is the best. They really set the bar. Food and service are amazing. Yes it's costly but you need to do it! Loved every bite!
1,"While on business in Las Vegas, I tapped into my network of friends and locals to recommend a new place to eat.  I have my regular spots that I enjoy but this time I wanted something a little different yet close to my hotel, Red Rock.  A few of them actually recommended that I try 808 Tapas in the Summerlin area, which recently opened for business.  \n\n808 Tapas appears to bill itself as an infusion of east & west and sake lounge.  The restaurant was quite easy to find given that its sign stood out among the neighboring businesses.  Upon entering, I was greeted with a warm \""ALOHA\"" by the staff, which was expected since 808 is the area code for the Hawaiian Islands.  From what my friends told me, I should expect Asian/Hawaiian influence fusion style dishes at a reasonable price range.\n\nMy business associate and I started with the Tensai Hamachi Shooters.  This dish caught my as I'm quite the fan of the hamachi shooters served at Michelin Star Alexander's in Cupertino. The hamachi flesh literally melted away in my mouth and the chef did an excellent job to find the perfect balance with the use of white truffle oil with the ponzu sauce.  It is $3 each or $15 for 6.  We opted for the half dozen. This dish is highly recommended!\n\nWe then ordered the Crab Stack Salad at the recommendation of our server.  You will love the way this dish is presented in a stack and then our server began mixing and tossing it table side before we anxiously dug in.  The ginger lime dressing was so refreshing and it complimented the veggies, mango, and the snow crab. This dish was $10 and it was more than enough for two of us to enjoy. What really stood out is the ample amount of snow crab in this dish.  I much prefer this than your usual artificial crab that's served in other sushi restaurants and in your typical \""all you can eat\"" joints.\n\nI took it upon myself to order the Uni Tempura as I am much familiar and enjoy this dish at Nobu.  Much to my surprise, this dish was served exactly like Nobu.  The only difference is it's a larger portion and plated differently.  I suspect there is some Nobu connection amongst the staff here.  If you eat uni, this dish is a must as it's a bargain in price at $10 with a much larger serving than you would get at Nobu.\n\nMy co-worker and I both decided to order the Fish Tacos.  The panko crusted tilapia was cooked to the perfect crisp and I absolutely enjoyed the blood orange slaw which complimented this dish well and this is definitely not your typical bland tasteless fish tacos like you get at xxxhoo's Fish Taco.  This dish was $6 for two tacos and a definite must order.\n\nBeing born and raised in Hawaii, the next dish caught my eye on the menu and I ordered it.  The Lomi Lomi Salmon Caprese is the 808 Tapas take of traditional caprese.  Fresh buffalo mozzarella topped with lomi lomi salmon, a traditional Hawaiian dish of salted salmon, sliced tomatoes, and diced onions drizzled with olive oil and balsamic vinegar. This dish was refreshing and I believe it truly represents the 808 area code.  I must commend the chef for his creativity and thought process in the creation of this dish.  You definitely need not be from Hawaii to enjoy this dish!  This dish was $7.50.\n\nWe ordered the Wagyu Beef Sliders.  These sliders were cooked to perfection with just the right amount of pink.  The marinated shiitake mushrooms were TASTY and the Hawaiian ginger wasabi mayo sauce was to die for.  This was one of the best burger/slider I've ever tasted!  I highly recommend this and I'll definitely be coming back just for this!  You get two sliders for $7.50 along with fresh made taro chips that are so addicting you'll be asking if you can order a bag of it for take out.\n\nWe were both getting a bit stuffed, but we gave in and ordered the Spicy Tuna Crackers for our last dish.  The crispy tempura nori crackers had just the right kick with wasabi and was topped with ahi tuna poke. This dish was $6.50 for five crackers and munching on these with a nice cold Kirin the next time I visit.\n\nWe had also ordered a pitcher of the 808 White Peach Sakeria to wash things down. It was refreshing and delicious!  It certainly opened my eyes and palate up to new creations and ways to enjoy drinking sake.\n\nWe didn't have room for dessert, however, the banana & apple fritters served with ice cream and fresh fruits looked absolutely mouth watering at the table next to us. I will leave room to experience this when I return next month to town for business.\n\nI believe this place will be a gem for the Summerlin community and will quickly fill its small capacity as word circulates amongst foodies who possess the palate to identify both quality and value.  The majority of the dishes are priced between $4 to $10."
0,Without a doubt this is the worst and horribly managed McDonald's in the entire universe.\n\n11 minutes to get an unsweetened tea with light ice if you can't get that order right you really shouldn't be working anywhere other than the hospital that did your lobotomy. I am convinced they are only in business because they have a golden arches and people who know no better go there. \n\nI will not be making that mistake again!
1,"Had to wait for a bit because most of the guests were celebrating with family and their recent graduates.  We ordered the Avocado Rolls for appetizers and they were awesome.  For the main meal, I had the Meatloaf and it's so much food, I couldn't finish it.  But I did have room for the Pineapple Upside Down Cheesecake and now I have diabetes. (Just kidding).  Definitely a restaurant I'd stop by again whenever I visit Vegas."
1,"It's no AJ's, but if you can find whatever it is you're looking for at the 99 Cent Store, it's the place to get it. \n\nThe title isn't just a clever name, everything that they carry is 99 cents. That includes anything from toothpaste, to laundry detergent, to dog food. If quality isn't an issue, I generally like to run through this store first and then pick up whatever I couldn't scratch off of the list at a traditional store. \n\nEven if you don't need anything in particular, it might be worth a swoop by to scope out their inventory. You might be surprised how convenient this place can be . . ."
1,"I'm staying at the Hilton & a familiar face, within walking distance, was in order. This fit the bill perfectly. Excellent bartenders, hats off to Mallory & Miranda. So-so beer selection, tho, that's why the 4 star instead of 5.  \n\nI ordered the ribeye, very rare, & was brought a ribeye mid well, much to my chagrin. Mallory watched me cut into it & immediately whisked it away for another try. The second steak could only have been better had it been first. Fork tender & seasoned to perfection. \n\nThe regulars at the bar are a hoot & very informative to those who don't know the area. I will definitely be back!"
1,"We made it a point to go to Mandalay specifically for Burger Bar since the reviews are so spectacular.  \n\nThe food was fantastic, the service was fantastic, and it was the only place in Mandalay packed at 12 in the afternoon.  That speaks for itself.  My only gripe is that they didn't have any beer or drink specials.  That's pretty lame.  I thought it would be more chic for some reason.   Other than that, Burger Bar met the expectation.  I'll be hitting them up EVERY TRIP!"
1,Delicious bruschetta! Loved the setting. This is a great place for a nice ladies lunch :)
0,"The WORST experience in years. After eating their horrible food and then finding a discrepancy in the check, I waited with my 2 daughters and my son 30 minutes for the manager to finally make his way to the restaurant. Juan came to our table in his flip flops, basketball shorts and t shirt and was immediately rude. To make a long story short, he told me I was wrong and my family left bewildered by the worst customer service I've experienced in many years. I like to support local businesses, but this was a huge mistake. Do yourself a favor and go to one of the hundreds of other restaurants in the east valley."
1,"We came here two separate times once at the Caf\u00e9 side the other at the Dinner side. I must say both times were superb.\n\nDinner side: I ordered the meat plate (forgot the name but it's a plate full of sausages, pork blood, and everything about meat.) My GF ordered the fried chicken steak. We both loved our dishes. The waiter is knowledgeable, friendly, and always there when you need them. The raw Oysters at the dinner side are fresh and delicious also. The fried chicken steak is tender juicy and crispy. They also offered in our opinion the third best Cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e in town. Here is our list for Cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e so far in Las Vegas:\n\n#1 - Eiffel Tower Restaurant at Paris\n#2 - Postrio at The Venetian's\n#3 - this place\n\nCaf\u00e9 side: The raw Oysters here are smaller, still fresh but not as fulfilling. Calamari is appetizing with a side of cucumbers to balance out the taste. The pizza was fulfilling and perfect for lunch. The Waitress was again delightful and accommodating.\n\nWe certainly will be back again next time we are in the sin city."
0,"Sometimes these stores are messy with stuff thrown everywhere, today no exception. I like to stop in from time to time to check the inventory. Some days you can find a bargain and some days it's all about the mess throughout the entire store. \n\nI did find it amusing to see Christmas decorations out in full force right next to the discounted Halloween leftovers. But I went looking for a round table cloth but instead found yarn for a $1, so it was a good day for me at Big lots. \n\nIf you go regularly, you can catch a few bargains now in then. I love the surprise of not knowing if they will have something and better yet find something you didn't expect. If you haven't been to Big lots, you should check it out."
0,"In the past we would go here almost every weekend.  But lately the food seems more processed and less fresh and the prices keep going up.  No a good value and my family does not really enjoy the food anymore.  The eggs are good example.  They don't taste good or even resemble eggs, but are easy to store and cook for the workers.   I am sure the company is making more profit now though."
1,"I don't eat burgers too often, but when I do, I choose the Juicy Lucy at Grind Burger!\nYum yum. Kind of a weird basic atmosphere set up, but very good food at a decent price. \nI will def go back again"
1,"I have been to Verizon more times than I can count, for all different kinds of shows, in all different kinds of weather. And I can say that, aside from the musical acts stinking it up occasionally, I have never had a bad time and have always left with another unusual story to tell.\n\nOver the years, the parking lot system has been greatly improved, to the point where you really don't wait that long to get out after the show. You used to wait for hours it seemed.\n\nThe best shows I have seen here have been Aerosmith, Steve Miller, James Taylor and, most recently, Journey.\n\nI have always sat on the lawn, and at each one of the shows listed above, a random old couple has handed me a joint. Every time, never fails. I am not a smoker, and I don't think I necessarily look like an obvious pot smoker. For some reason though, a random old hippie couple hands me something to smoke. Never fails.\n\nOf course, like every other major entertainment venue, beer prices are out of this world! That's why we arrive early and tailgate like crazy, so we don't have to buy more than one or two beers inside, if any at all.\n\nIt used to be fairly easy to sneak in an airplane bottle or two, but they have cracked down considerably on that and check people over very thoroughly.\n\nThe sound and acoustics are pretty good, and its easy to hear and see even from way back on the lawn.\n\nThe employees have always been fair and helpful in my experiences."
0,"Second time I've come here, this time with coworkers. \n\nThe atmosphere is the usual sports bar/rustic hooters vibe. Nothing special, except for a big stage in the middle of the place. Apparently they host bands on weekends. . . \n\nService was ok - we had a large group so it wasn't very fast, but the refills were done well and there wasn't a crazy lag between when we ordered and when the food came. In retrospect, that should have been a tip - no way you can make high-quality product for 20 people in 10 minutes unless the fryolator is in overdrive! \n\nRegarding the food - very average. The signature items (wings) are ok, but I've had much better at places like Buffalo Wild Wing, Hooters and Even the ol' Cheeze Moz' pizza place (I miss their coal-fired wings!). The buffalo sauces are very mild, even if you get the very hot ones. . .It's a personal pet peeve, but if it says 'hot' it should be HOT, not less mild. Some friends had the pulled pork sandwich and declared it mediocre at best. I had a salad too (trying to stay healthy) and it was about as vanilla as you can get. \n\nOverall, the only advantage of this place is location (EpiCentre). Even then there are better options around - 5 guys for Burgers, Jason's Deli for salad, Blackfinn for wings, etc."

Not so much because of the food, which was ok, (not good or great.) but because of their lack of customer service and unfair price advertising.\n\nTheir menu does not correctly reflect their prices and they charged me for fries/salad on top of the price of the gyro. The menu states \""served with fries or a salad\"" but when I got my bill I was charged additional money for the side items. When I questioned it, I was told that was a lunch special. The menu is on their wall and there is a menu handout and there is nothing about lunch specials or lunch pricing.\n\nThey would NOT take the charges off, but just kept arguing with me."
0,"*Edit 5/30/11:\nI was mistakenly given Mojgan's name.  If Mojgan ever reads this I profusely apologize!!  I've heard that Mojgan is nothing but sweet and helpful.  I don't know the name of the awful S.A. at this store but I know that she is tall with short dark hair and some kind of European accent who has a sour expression on her face.*\n\n*Edit 2/28/12:\nVeronica has moved and no longer works for the company :(  The other sales associate I like is Linda if she is still there.  Very nice woman and always encourages people to try on their shoes.\n\nThe people who work at this location (and most of the CL boutiques come to think about it) are not the friendliest yet there is one particular person who brings this store down to one star.  Her name is Mojgan (not sure if it's spelled correctly but she's the one with the accent), and she is one of the worst sales associates that I have ever encountered in my life and made my last trip to the store such a disappointment.  Even walking out empty-handed you should leave with that kid in a candy store feeling after being surrounded by all those beautiful shoes, but I left with a bad taste in my mouth instead.\n\nMojgan was not very helpful and seemed unwilling to answer questions and find availability of requested styles.  When she did answer a question, she was very short and often did not answer the question correctly, as if she were answering a totally different question than what was actually asked.  She came off as not very knowledgeable on product and product availability which is unacceptable when your customers are more informed and knowledgeable than the sales associates.  And I've heard that she's the manager of this store.  If so, unbelievable!  I asked for a particular shoe which she said they didn't have only to see minutes later someone trying them on in the store!  She could have at least told me that they had the shoe, just not in my size.  She made it seem like she did not care for my business or the other person I was with (who happens to own countless pairs of \""Loubs\""), which is fine because I do not plan on ever giving them any of my business.  I'm turned off to the whole brand now, but it's okay because I have discovered other brands that are sexier, edgier, and less expensive than Louboutins.  Not to mention more comfortable!  \n\nNever again, Las Vegas boutique!  However, if you are after some Loubs and must go to this location, go see the young, blonde sales associate who works there.  I believe her name is Veronica.  She is the most pleasant and helpful sales associate at the store."
0,"Cool place, good food, horrible service. I want to like this place but the staff is cold and inconsiderate. Makes you feel like they are doing you a favor by letting you eat here. If service is important,  go somewhere else."
0,"Unauthorized Charges on my Credit Card:\n\nI booked a reservation at the Aria and ended up cancelling that one and setting up a new reservation after finding a better deal for being an MLife gold member.  However, the Aria still charged me a deposit for two reservations and refuses to assist in the removal of the other charge.  Their phone help has been giving me the runaround.  I'm now on the phone with my credit card company to get them involved.  I have to say this is incredibly disappointing and leaving a very bad taste in my mouth.  I'm hoping this situation can be rectified and I get the chance to enjoy my stay in a few weeks. Until then, I recommend double checking your credit card statements for unauthorized charges!"
0,"I brought in a coupon and asked them if I could use it, before I even sat down. They said it wasn't a problem. But once I went to pay, they didn't want to honor it. They even wanted to charge me for having to mix extra hair dye. My hair isn't even shoulder length, and there was a ton of extra mixture in the bowl. There was no reason she needed extra. The color I picked was \""light ash brown\"", which apparently turns into \""dark ass black\"" when your stylist is outside smoking a cigarette and leaves the color on for ten minutes too long. All in all, the staff was very unprofessional, and the lady that did my hair looked like she just rolled out of bed that morning and threw on some old ratty clothes. I don't even think she had brushed her hair. What a slob."
0,"The service was horrible. They ran out of hot water for the Pedicures, some of their nail tools were not sanitized, and the polish job for my mani/pedi was bad."
1,Love it! we had a wonderful meal ! We finished it up with Ice cream! Yum :-) now I'm happy to drive back to LA!
0,"Queen City Dog Service (or should I say simply, Jordan Frye) is an absolute fraud.  Not only did he stuff our pets in the garage for more than a day, and left them without food (though he was contracted for two full visits a day), he was also caught on camera stealing several items during his second visit (during which he only went upstairs to steal items, without visiting the still-stranded animals).  As I am currently swearing out a warrant against him, hopefully no one else will be defrauded in the near future, but in the meantime ... STAY AWAY!"
1,"I have been to La Bocca a number of times, from when it first opened to frankly, when it found its footing and became a place I really enjoyed going. Since the establishment promotes itself as a place for great pizza I place a great deal of importance on that claim. \n\nWhen I initially went the pizza was way too much crust and not enough toppings. Now the pizza is much less crust and more toppings and the quality of the crust has improved significantly. My favorite is the Pepperoni pizza, made with these large slices and drizzled with Queen Creek Chili olive oil, and it is so good. The German style pizza with a white sauce, fennel seeds, and bacon, and a name I am unable to pronounce, is also super good. \n\nNow, as for the wine selection, for a wine bar, not so good. it seems like the wine selection could be much broader, especially for a place right down the street from a place like Cafe Boa. On the other hand, when the weather is good, a great place to grab some outside seating, a bottle of wine, and to enjoy some of the finest people watching anywhere in Phoenix (or more specifically, Tempe). \n\nFinal thought, as a 40 something adult, making a decent income, La Bocca is one of the best places to go for a relaxing evening with friends. It seems that while chain stores are closing unique places like this will continue to grow and prosper and help to create a new and unique environment for Mill avenue (now if someone could just convince Changing Hands bookstore to open up again on Mill)."
1,Ok so I'm half Dominican and don't get to eat Dominican food a lot so I was so happy when a friend told me about this place the prices are moderate it's not fancy by any means very casual but the food is excellent and pretty authentic the stewed chicken was hearty and the tostones and yuca were super yummy if you like dominican food I recommend this place ..and for those who like it they have Goya Malta there (super gross) but most Hispanic and Caribbean ppl love it and it's hard to come by in restaurants check it out
1,"Excellent vegetarian Jain food.\n\nThis is probably the best thai food I have eaten.\n\nThe service is superb. The person who took the order was very patient as we had too many questions and requests ( not to put onion, garlic, fish sauce, oyster sauce, eggs) and he was so helpful. The other person who served us with water and drinks was also very courteous.\n\nWe ordered the following items:\nPanang Curry (regular with onion and garlic)\nDrunken Noodles (veggie- Jain)\nThai Fried Rice(veggie - Jain)\nFried Tofu\n\nThe lemon-lime drink and the iced-tea were also good.\n\nThey gave a decent quantity of rice with the food too and we did not need to ask for any more rice (some places they give you small bowls of rice and then you end up ordering extra rice bowls)\n\nWould definitely visit it again when I am back in Vegas."
0,"This place is way over priced and not worth it. I will admit, I've never dined in, only gotten take out, but I've payed out the wazoo and wasn't ever pleased."
1,"I'm a huge fan of this Starbucks. It's an easy shot off I-77 and the staff goes out of their way to get to know you and your drink. I know that's the Starbucks wat, but I get the feeling they actually like working there. It's right in the beginning of Baxter Village so you can sit down at the outdoor seating old wonder around town through the shops and little park."
0,"When I first moved to Madison I was really excited to come to this restaurant because the man had hyped it up as a great Thai eatery.  When I finally visited the restaurant it definitely did not live up to the hype.\n\nOn the plus side the place is really nice and is a great place for dates and groups as it is very large.  However the food, as this is a restaurant, should also be great and unfortunately it was not.  I ordered a red curry dish which sounded great but was disappointed at first bite.  It's not that it was bad because it certainly wasn't but it just wasn't great.  There seemed to be something missing that I was not able to put my finger on.  The man ordered the pad Thai which he actually loved.  I didn't try any of it so I don't have anything to say about it.\n\nAs far as the presentation of the food however that was spot on.  I would recommend this place to anyone trying to venture out and try something different as the flavors are not in your face.  Also the staff was great and very attentive."
0,"The service here is horrendous. I came in for the first time on a Friday evening to grab a drink with my friend on her birthday. The first person to greet us was some dude who appeared to be loitering in the middle of the empty bar. I couldn't tell if he worked there so  we started making our way to the patio until he hollered at us. Apparently we needed permission to seat ourselves...? It then took over 20 minutes before a server approached, even though we were one of four parties, and another 10 minutes passed before our drinks arrived.... again, we were 1 of 4!!! How long does it take to make a vodka soda?!\n\nThe bar set up itself is pretty stellar. Very open. Plenty of room for people to come in, realize the place blows, and then leave... Maybe the food rocks. I don't know. But I won't be coming back to find out.\n\nI miss The Angelic"
1,I love this place! \n\nDefinitely worth checking out!

1,"The prices may be high; but Smeeks is the best candy shop in the valley. It is absolutely adorable inside. They have an awesome, albeit small selection of sodas right next to the door, from orange to grape to a mid-west, childhood staple - Green River. They have all kinds of candy - retro stuff, vegan treats, taffy, bubblegum, 10 and 25 cent treats, as well as their own bagged gummy and chocolate candies. \n\nThey also have some of my favorite novelty items, always good for gifts - like World Wide Fred kitchen supplies, extra large moustaches, and magnets and key-toppers galore. There is always something you can find at Smeeks. \n\nOne of my favorite parts is their photobooth. It IS digital, but the photos don't come out pixelated - in fact, they look pretty similar to film photobooths. Smeeks even has a basket full of hats, glasses, and other props to truly enhance your photobooth-ing experience! The price is $5 for two sets (and two copies per set)! It's a really, really good deal on photobooth pictures - at the state fair, one copy of one set was $5!\n\nMy question to others who've said they found a better candy shop is - where?! I haven't seen a cuter, more unique candy shop in Arizona - ever!"
1,Thumbs Up!\n\nI vouch you won't find a better margherita pizza or meatballs surrounded by more TV's in your life.
1,"Just ate here tonight.  Was pretty good.  \nI will admit, I'm more a fan of hakata style ramen, so I'm not too eager to go back, but I'm rating this for what it is.  \nThe only reason it lost a star was that their gyoza wasn't too great.  Not bad, and pretty well priced, but I've had many a plate of superior gyoza.\nThat said, the pork was very flavorful, the soup was very rich, the menma added some very nice flavor, the waitresses were courteous and refilled my water very quickly.  \nIf you're a fan of ramen, definitely give them your business, but be warned, this is northern style, so it could be a bit rich for you like it was for me.  That said, I'll definitely be back to have my friends try it, they just still haven't stolen the number one spot in my heart from monta...  Well, the number 2 spot, number 1 is ramen stadium back in hakata."
0,"When it comes to the food, the Old Fashioned is overrated. And disappointing, because their foods are relatively simple and therefore should be done consistently well. It's the usual story in disappointing Madison restaurants: no subtlety and a lack of attention to detail.\n\nAfter several experiences with sandwiches that were only okay, in later visits I moved on to the specials. Twice I had the Saturday night prime rib and twice I was disappointed. Because they don't know (or care about) the difference between rare and medium-rare. Also, forget about the French Onion soup. What should be an old-school crock with a layer of parmesan and gruyere bubbling over a salty onion beef broth is instead a weak pretender, with hardly a layer of cheese worth mentioning. Come on now.\n\nI will say that the accompanying wedge salad is more than decent and that the onion string fries are a terrific. But they are not the main event and can't carry the show by themselves. \n\nI say all this actually *liking* the Old Fashioned, its concept and experience. It could be great, but it's just not."
0,"This review is based on 3 separate visits, all dine-in.\n\nFood: I ordered the Carolina, Classic, and Chicago burgers, one for each visit. The burger itself is a bit too greasy, and over-salted.The burger patty is oversized in diameter for the bun, making the burger extremely sloppy and messy to eat. The taste was average, with the Carolina burger being the most interesting and flavorful. The fries were interesting and moderately tasty, but not extraordinary. \n\nPrice: The price was somewhat higher than the direct competition, and overpriced for the quality of the food. \n\nCleanliness: The restaurant was relatively clean, although finding a clean table was a challenge on all three visits. The place is brightly colored and lit,with a slight retro 50's psuedo-west coast vibe.\n\nService: Service is, for want of a better word, terrible. The level of apathy displayed by the employees (including the managers) approaches the level of t.v. sitcom cliche. It's so pervasive they should just incorporate it into the smashburger theme. The service was bad on all 3 visits.\n\nOverall: I was excited to have another burger joint in Ballantyne, but overall Smashburger is a disappointment. The price is too high for average food with poor service. There are 2 Five Guys in the area, I would definitely recommend them over Smashburger; they have a better product, cleaner restaurant, lower prices, and employee who at least pretend to care."
0,"That doesn't meet my basic expectation. We came here for dinner and ordered some noodles. One of them has stinky tofu and they didn't tell us. They should let their customer know that one of their noodles has stinky tofu, not everyone can accept that smell. Service was alright, don't expect too much. Food wasn't good."
0,"I've tried this place three times now. Sorry, but there won't be a fourth. Hard to understand the menu. We love fun rolls. I think pictures would help. The food is just not good. Maybe a smaller menu with great items would help this place. I dunno. Ambiance is eh. Doesn't feel very Japanese or anything really."
0,"DO NOT GO HERE!!!!!! I went to get a charger only, I didn't even need repairs done. I had a trip that I had planned and told the owner that I needed it by Friday. He guaranteed me that he would have it the next day (Thursday) but since he had to order it from the distributor he wanted a deposit. I have him $40 (the charger was $57). I was told by the girl at the front and her child who was working in the shop that they didn't take cash so I had to go to an ATM. I went in Friday to pick it up and it was not there. I was literally on my way to the airport and needed it right away. The lady at the front who was incredibly rude both times refused to refund my deposit even though I was lied to and wouldn't have put one down if I had been told the truth. Ended up buying one elsewhere and paying a lot, but at least I actually got the product I was promised. I also intend on reporting them to the BBB. Awful customer service all around. THEY WILL LIE TO YOU TO GET YOUR MONEY. STAY AWAY!!!!!"

0,"A girlfriend of mine was in from out of town and, who knew she was a closet Cher fan?!\n\nAnyway, she wanted to go, so we went, even though I am not a Cher fan...\n\nThe other reviews pretty much captured it--  lots of covers, lots of Sonny and Cher nostalgia, few songs from the Cher solo era.\n\nBE WARNED.  THIS IS NOT A CHER CONCERT.  It is like a variety show.  \n\nDon't get me wrong, everyone definitely needs to give Cher some props for being 60+ and getting on stage in a sparkly body stocking.  She looked fantastic.  \n\nAND, this is not one of those \""comeback\""/\""reunion\"" shows in which the headliner is really too old to be on stage...  she did get down with her dancers and her voice is still there...\n\nBUT, the covers were really confusing.  Why?  She's been in the music business for like 40 years, and she couldn't pick out enough of her own material to fill an hour and a half?\n\nAND, we didn't understand the overall flow of the show...  I think there was supposed to be some implied \""chronology of her life\"" thing going on, but (again), if it's HER life, then why not HER songs?  Each \""number\"" was introduced by a video montage of Cher footage--  from the Sonny and Cher era, from her movies, etc., then the screen would go up and everyone (Cher and dancers) would be in some period costume and she would sing a song that was not related to the introductory montage, and maybe not related to the period costumes...\n\nAND, the costumes were definitely over the top.  I agree with the previous reviewer who said that they could definitely have dropped a couple of costume changes to give us a little more music.  The show was 1 song = 1 costume.  The introductory video montages were not exactly short, to give everyone time to change...  It got kind of old after a while.\n\nIf you are a fan of the \""big Vegas production\"", I would recommend Elton John over this any day of the week.  Him, his piano, some video, some background effects and that's it = great show.  Cher, 15 dancers, 15 costume changes, countless collages of Cher photos over the years, and few actual Cher songs, just ended up producing a show that was  mediocre at best."

1,"Great Bar with your usual upgraded bar food.  The food is not 5 star cuisine expertly prepared by a chef that has a manicure and a show on Food Network, but it is actually not that bad.  Margaritaville has amazing drinks, great service, and great atmosphere.  That is why you go here.  You do not really go for the food.  \n\nThat would be like visiting Hooters for the wings.\nThat would be like going to church to pick up chicks.\nThat would be like going to a funeral to pick up chicks.\nThat would be like admitting yourself in the hospital for the free tongue depressers.\nThat would be like drinking whiskey out of a wine glass (you just look stupid).\nThat would be like going early to a Stones concert and Michael Bolton is the opening act.\nThat would be like going to a library to practice drums.\nThat would be like going to a petting zoo on the first date.\nThat would be like bringing your laptop on a 3 hour cruise.\nThat would be like shaving your body in the winter.\nThat would be like getting married when she isn't even mad at you.\nThat would be like curtain shopping at Bed Bath and Beyond and expecting it not to suck.\nThat would be like going to Amsterdam and having a job interview with drug test the day after you come home.\n\n....don't expect the food to be mind-blowing, just enjoy the bar atmosphere for what it is."

0,"Arrived for Sunday lunch-dinner with the kids and only one other couple was there. \n\nStarted with the Sizzling Rice Soup, which we all shared, and the broth was really good. It had veggies, chicken, pork and shrimp. It was really tasty and if we go back I would definitely try it again. \n\nWe had the Hunan Spicy two which is shrimp and chicken in a sweet and spicy red sauce, really good. Also had the Sizzling Go Ba which is four meats poured into a sizzling pan in front of you. After the sizzle went out though the flavors were bland. It's a clear sauce, but needed salt or some other spice. \n\nI would go again if invited, but not by choice."

Will not be coming here again."
0,"These guys are crooks!.  Had a party of over 15 people.  They changed the price from $1200 to $3200 (after we had already paid the amount) because our 10 hour reservation was only permitted to drive within a three (3) mile radius of the strip!  Claimed there were taxes, fees, tariffs and surcharges.  Huh?\n\nRun away!!!  Run away!! My party was left standing in the middle of a parking lot 4 blocks off the strip because we would not pay the ransom.  Got a different bus company and SAVED $400 off the original quote...Not the ransomed amount...the quote.   Wish I would have read yelp first.  \n\nLuckily my credit card company agreed with the dispute.  But these guys would not refund the full amount we paid (for 10 hours) even though we drive 1/2 mile and used 1 hour.  Crooks!\n\nHey Yelp.. please allow negative ratings."

1,"Came in last night for FREE Blooming Onions. We went straight to the bar area and ordered our onion, mushrooms and two side salads. \n\nFirst off the Blooming Onion is always looks fantastic but that sauce is horrible. I get that some people like horseradish but to me it's a taste that I can never get out of my mouth. I don't know who you folks are that like horseradish, but I just can't trust you. \n\nThe mushrooms were awesome as always! We even took half of the order home and warmed them up in the oven for a snack.\n\nHowever, the salads were kind of pathetic and not worth $3.99 each. I loved the croutons though. But, the salad was very small with cheap iceburg lettuce. \n\nService was top notch. We never went without a refill and he checked back after everything he brought us."
0,"Ugh, this place is just terrible. It tries to be high-end but has nothing going for it -- not even that view of the ugly fake lake. Definitely not worth the hefty price tag! \n\nWe had a 6:30 reservation that night and they had already run out of the rib appetizer by the time we got there. When I ordered a salad and soup as an entree, they told me I shouldn't do it because the two plates \""wouldn't fit next to each other.\"" I persisted, and they made it seem like a huge inconvenience -- but when the plates came out, everything fit just fine. \n\nMy mom's salad was wilted and my lobster chowder was bland with absolutely no taste. The salmon entree was dry and the carne ranchero annoyingly chewy. We really couldn't get out of here quickly enough, and ended up snacking in our hotel room afterwards!"
0,"Came here for lunch with a co-worker. They have $5.95 and $6.95 lunch special options. The lunch special comes with choice of egg drop or hot and sour soup, a salad, and an eggroll. I opted for hot and sour soup and ginger beef. 20 minutes later after placing our order, we didn't even get our soup or salad. People coming in after us were halfway through their meals. I flag down a waitress to inquire and she apologizes and walks away. The original waitress comes by and apologizes stating it was her fault because she forgot to put in THE ENTIRE ORDER. Shortly after our food comes through, hot & sour soup was the highlight. The ginger beef was bland with chewey pieces of beef. Do you think they offered anything to rectify their mistake and taking away 20 minutes of our lunch break? That would be no. The waitress tried to make fake niceties and small talk after. Bland food and careless staff.. no thank you."
1,"They just finished my car, I have to say this is the best place to take your car in town. I called several places and they were quoting me way too much. Not only was the owner Jeff extremely honest and helpful, he told me I didn't need a lot of the things I was told I needed; I saved so much money.  It's hard finding a mechanic being a girl, but I got lucky with this place. I am extremely happy and will continue to be a customer here :D"
0,"They are building one of these near us on Baseline rd so we decided to try them out at the McDowell location first. The place is definately popular and crowded. The buffet selection was as expected and the food was good. Service was good considering the large amount of people eating. \n\nI am a big fan of sushi but the prepared selection was dismal. You can have some made to order but no one was around to take our order. Things got worse as my son needed to use the restroom. After seeing how awful the men's room was, I asked my wife to check on the women's room. She stated it was even worse. So sadly, we left our meal early just so we could get our son to a restroom. It certainly made us think twice about visiting this location again. We hope that we will have a better experience at the new location on Baseline once it opens."
1,"This place is great. I came here after looking on yelp for sandwiches and decided to try this place with my girlfriend and her mom. The vibe when you first come in is very welcoming and the owners are great. They asked if we had been in before and were happy to explain the menu to us and tell us everything is made by them.\n\nI had the strange folk, girlfriend had the suicide six and her mom had the tuna. We all really enjoyed our sandwiches. The ingredients tasted fresh and the bread definitely tasted home made. We all had different sides so we could try them all. Pasta salad had a sweeter taste to it which it wasn't bad I just prefer a more Italian style. Potato salad was really good though.\n\nService and food was all great we even bought some of their homemade dog biscuits they sell. I'll definitely make this place a staple of my Arizona visits"
1,Best piece of duck I've ever had. The menu is a spectacle of high-end tapas. Fabulous  selection of esquisite and flavorful delicacies. The generous staff begins and ends each meal with tasty surprise.
0,"I visited Central while I was staying and Caesars and I was far from impressed.\n\nMy first problem is that they have items on their menu that they no longer serve and I'm not talking about a situation where they run out of a certain product and no longer have it at this time, they literally have items on their menu that they have not served at Central for months and have no plans on serving anytime soon.  That right there is a major issue.\n\nThe service is shotty, the waiters and what I believe to be a busboy or assistant waiter happen to know nothing about the menu.  Couldn't really answer questions and they actually contradicted each other.  I asked the waitress about the item that was on the menu that they no longer served and she said they didn't serve it anymore, two seconds later another guy claims that they do serve this item.  I'm going need the staff to know the menu and actually discuss what is going on inside the kitchen and with the menu.\n\nThe food was blah, I had the meatloaf and the mashed potatoes, the mashed potatoes were way too salty. It was unbearably salty and borderline uneatable.  The meatloaf was okay, nothing special at all about it but at least it tasted like what it was suppose to be and not just salt.\n\nPrices are a bit outrageous for the quality of service and food that you receive.  I have no plans on making a return trip to Central upon my next visit to Vegas.  Definitely not up to Michel Richard's standards."
1,Was in a lot of pain during my vacation.  I am 300 miles from home.  I Found the doc on yelp.  He was a no bullshit chiropractor.  He didn't try and do X-rays and all that other garbage that others try.  I explained what I get done at the chiropractor at home and he did it.  I only had an hour before I had to leave and I was on my way with 20 minutes to spare.  He offered me treatment but all I wanted was a good adjustment and i got it.  I will be back my next time in Vegas.
0,"I've been to Kaya in the past and it was great.  However, it appears to be experiencing a rough go of it lately.  I went for lunch and ordered the Jerk Chicken.  The menu describes it as a \""tropical chop salad, romaine, flour tortillas, mango, pineapple, cucumbers, tomatoes, cilantro, avocado.\""  What I received was chicken atop a pile of pineapple with some slices of avocado on the side.  The redemption of the meal was the wonderful chowder and some good wine."

If I am thirsty, I like to stop here and get a diet ocean water. Hubby likes to get coke with cherries. You can also buy their ice if you are having a party. Not much else to report here. Check it out!"
1,"Very good food! Our table ordered hotdogs, hamburgers, and fries (plain fries, cheese, and chili-cheese fries). The service was quick, the owner came to the table and was super friendly (definitely not annoying) - they made it clear that they were grateful for our visit!! Great place!!"
0,I will never go back to this place. My burger was good and I had a lot of choices  but my husbands chili was very generic and tasted like it was microwaved. The staff seemed good at first but as the night went on it only got worse. Not the worst place to eat but not a place I would recommend to friends.
0,"1 star for manager Bill who proudly proclaimed that, \""as a manager, my job is not to make decisions for people but to enforce the company policy.\"" - WOW! Thanks Bill! You're a real winner, and really helpful to boot.\n\n5 stars for the Store Manager Dave who apparently shares a different view of what being a manager means. Thanks to him, I'll definitely return at some point in the future!"
0,"Word to the wise: make sure you eat before you go so that by the time your food arrives, you'll be hungry again.\n\nI'm just disappointed that I had to wait 20 minutes to be greeted by our server without the thrill of a lap dance.\n\nWe were so thrilled when our server finally arrived, that we gave him our drink, appetizer, and entree selection. I'm not sure if you've heard, but this is how service at a restaurant normally works: You arrive, you're greeted by the host/hostess then seated at the proper table that will accommodate your party size comfortably. Next, the server or server assistant greets you within 5 minutes to take your drink order and offer some appetizer suggestions. Once the drinks arrive they take the order for both your appetizer and your entree or just your appetizer and give you some more time to look over the menu while they put your appetizer in...should I say more? Guess what happened after he took all three orders? Another 20 minutes of staring at each other and our appetizers arrived. They took so long to get to us, I forgot what we ordered! Apparently, we ordered the Craw Puppies. They were good, an innovative dish with an original sauce to match.\n\nUnfortunately, the appetizer was a tease for the beast (my stomach). Guess what came after the appetizer? Another wait...by this time, I was trying to think happy thoughts and sing some lullabies to keep the beast distracted. My date asked if we could have some bread (since all the other tables around us had some) while we were waiting. He also asked the server if he could check on the status of our food. My date decided to take a smoke break while I started to die in slow motion and feel my stomach feed off itself.\n\nFinally, our food arrives. I had ordered the catfish platter which came with two sides. I chose greens and sweet potato fries. The starvation I was experiencing made me so delusional that I actually thought the word \""platter\"" meant more than one piece of fish. Nope...just one. As long as the food took, I was hoping that the cook had gone to the lake and caught a  school  of fish for me to eat. Can you believe that after all that my greens were gross & cold?! AND my sweet potato fries were lukewarm. Unfortunately, I had to work the next day...so I couldn't send them back. I did ENJOY my  catfish, however, as long as it took to make...I was expecting it to be ORGASMIC. I did want to try dessert, but like I said before...I had to work the next evening.\n\n\nThe moral of the story? LUKEWARM THINGS COME TO THOSE WHO WAIT!\n\nMANAGEMENT: AN HOUR AND A HALF FOR A 2 COURSE MEAL?! ARE YOU EFFING KIDDING ME?!! Please feel free to retrain your staff using my tips as a guide. I swear, I won't even take credit for it."
1,"Love Love LOVE Retro Bakery!   For my wedding in 2010, I probably tried cupcakes from every cupcake making bakery Las Vegas, North Las Vegas, Summerlin, and Henderson.  I tasted A LOT of cupcakes.  Retro was by far the best and for my wedding, they were totally flexible (I mix and matched cake and icing flavors how I wanted them) and did a mix of full size and mini cupcakes.  I only wish I hadn't been in a wedding dress so I could have eaten one of each!\n\nThe cupcakes are moist and flavorful and the butter cream frosting is delicious.  They put all kinds of fun toppers on too.  Each month they have a special flavor (which are always amazing) and I try to stop in every once in a while just for fun and they are my first stop for special occasions!\n\nBTW, I have dreams about the hopscotch and salted caramel cupcakes....  mmmmm...."
1,"Yep, I obviously like wings. I keep going back. Service isn't the best but the wings sure are pretty good and so is the pizza. I guess if you don't care whether or not you have drinks to wet your whistle this place is great. Good thing the wings are cheap on Tuesdays. Really makes up for the sucky service when the bill comes."
0,Worst service! Ordered a hot fudge banana shake and instead got a Sunday. Instead of being nice about it the girl told me I ordered it wrong but she would remake it for me.
0,"The atmosphere is decent, but the food is absolutely terrible.  It is nothing but chewy meat covered in cheap cheese and grease.   The quesadillas are served in a pool of grease and the nachos are some of the worst in Phoenix,  The quality is an insult to the prices charged and an affront to good Mexican food.  Stick with the beer."
1,This is my go-to Date location in Las Vegas. I think its the perfect first-date spot on the strip because of thr Tapas style dining. What could a better ice breaker be than talking about which food items you would like to share?\n\nDef order:\nBacon Wrapped dates\nSangria \nSliders \nFilet\n\nRequest:\nA table on the Patio. The view is simply amazing! \n\nThe only downside is that it is slightly pricey. I haven't had a bill less than $150 after drinks/apps. The drinks in particular are super what adds up quickly. They are so tasty that you want to order them again and agian!
0,"We tried Marcello's while visiting from out of town. Service was very friendly, though somewhat slow, and the decor and music were nice. We got the calamari as an appetizer, and it was a little bland. There also were a few pieces of metal on the plate- not sure where they came from, but fortunately we didn't eat them. My husband had the pizza, which he said was wonderful. I ordered the spinach ravioli with marinara sauce. The food took a while to come out of the kitchen, which was surprising as there were not many people in the restaurant. When my ravioli arrived, it was made with the wrong sauce. They quickly got a new order out, but the pasta wasn't fully cooked.\n\nEven if we weren't out-of-towners, we wouldn't eat here again. Too bad, because I was really looking for pasta."
1,"We stayed in a villa at the Polo Towers for four nights 03-17-14 to 03-21-14 and we very much enjoyed our stay. We purchased this through a vendor at the Sacramento Landscape show for $149. The only obligation was to attend a \""90 minute\"" timeshare presentation. It was very easy and low pressure. Just be honest from the start if you're not interested in purchasing, don't ask questions and be nice about it. The process took about 110 minutes but the presentation was good, the presenter was funny, and the time passed quickly. One of the easiest I've ever been to. After the presentation we were directed to Gifting and received a $100 VISA which we used all over the strip at restaurants and for a show. Total price: $49 - FOR FOUR NIGHTS IN A VILLA!!\n\nThe villa itself was very nice. Located on the second floor facing the entrance but still fairly quiet. Granite countertops, large jetted tub, sound system, lots of closet space, two flat screens, free Wi-Fi, balcony, full kitchen with full-sized fridge (with icemaker), stove, microwave, dishwasher, cutlery, dishes, comfy bed, bathroom with separate his/her sink and counter. The roof-top pool is nice and even has gas bbq's for guest use. The only negative was the air conditioner in the room was a little loud.\n\nGreat central location on the strip, very nice room, friendly staff, non-gambling hotel.  Would definitely do this deal again if offered."
1,"I'm writing this review for my dad. (I can't talk him into starting his own Yelp account! Lol!) He went there over the weekend and this is what he said: \""Service was excellent and the quality of their meats is unbeatable! Excellent!\"" He will definitely be going back. While there he bought Delmonico Steaks. They were superb! My parents ate them for dinner last night and said those were some of the best steaks they've ever had. Apparently, if you're a meat lover...it could be compared to a kid in a candy shop! Everything you could want and more! \n\nMy husband and I have every intention to check this place out! It sounds like a very unique place!"
1,"Love this place!!! The food is great, the atmosphere is fun and the service is always friendly. I just wish it was closer to home so I could go more!  The crowd is usually eclectic and it's a great stop to or from an event downtown since it's on the lightrail route. I wish they had a bit more parking (for when we do drive there) and it can get a bit noisy inside but it's still well worth it!\n\nIf you order the basket of fries ask them to do half and half so you get to try two kinds!"
1,"The Big Fat Greek has zesty and flavorful food at a fairly reasonable price.  I have gone here for dinner and lunch time.  The ambiance to this place would be great for a dinner date.  I have tried only their chicken dishes, but it meets my standards in comparison to Greek food in LA.  I usually order the plate, which comes with a delicious Greek salad and seasoned fresh potatoes.  \n\nThe service is very attentive and caring.  I felt like I got water or drinks every 15 minutes refilled."
0,The menu lists a $7 charge for upgrading any burger with soda and fries and when the bill comes $3.50 is listed separately as a soda and the other $3.50 is included in the burger line item. Confusing pricing scheme and mediocre food.
0,"Very disappointed for my first and last time coming here. The Spanish gentleman who took my order for 3 Philly cheesesteaks could not comprehend what cheese wiz was and just kept saying American. Then he took \""everything with provolone\"" as a cheesesteak with all of their cheeses on it, lol. So after a 5 min long ordering process for 3 philly cheesesteaks speaking like a child to this guy due to his lack of english skills he finally got it right. I'm born and raised in Philadelphia so I know how to order a cheesesteak. As I sat and waited for my order, another gentleman came in and walked to the take out pick up counter in the front and asked the tall, thin, around 55 or so man working (he said he was one of the managers) if he could order one Philly cheesesteak, and the counter guy just pointed at the back and said \""you can't get a Philly cheesesteak but you can get a Phoenix cheesesteak.\"" The guy trying to order was all confused and said I guess and proceeded to the back as the guy working the counter continued to say that he didn't want their sandwiches affiliated with Philadelphia cause its a horrible place with horrible people. So I kind of laughed and asked, wow, did you have a negative experience there or something. And he just said its a horrible place to go, and he feels bad for people who live in that \""hell hole.\"" At this point I was getting offended and said hey man not all parts of Philly are bad, I'm born and raised there as well as my whole family and we turned out ok and love where we are from. He then told me I didn't know what I was talking about and that he wasn't changing his mind because it was the truth. I then realized his ignorant personality was not going to at least be open and talk like a normal person, so I called him an ignorant \""you know what\"" and laughed at him for how bitter he was and said he should try shutting his mouth with his ignorant opinions openly in a deli that attracts many east coasters, perhaps others from Philly as well or others with family from that area. Thankfully, I did not think the cheesesteak was that good at all! Corleone's is much better for a cheesesteak so if your trying to get the authentic experience for a True Philly Cheesesteak, don't go here where they apparently hate Philadelphians anyways... There is no excuse for ignorant management. Not even an apology from his narrow minded self because he said out loud in front of a few people that everyone has the right to their own opinions. Now his opinions and sub par at best cheesesteaks are a reason I will trash talk this place to everyone I associate with here in the valley."
1,"I would definitely say this is the best buffet I've ever been to, even in Vegas. Reasonably priced and everything was really well presented, fresh, and tasted delicious. I loved it! Try everything, it is a buffet after all!"
0,"I had been going to them for years, but stopped a few years back feeling they lacked the attention to detail they once had. This feeling was confirmed recently when issues started presenting themselves. I've discovered incorrect parts (wrong size fuel filter, etc.) were installed...and the freeze plug they left in my engine! A few years back I had them replace some freeze plugs that were leaking. Well, they didn't tell me one popped into my engine and they did not try to retrieve it! A month ago the plug worked its way into my pump. Engine smoked, seized, and shredded my s-belt. Luckily it happened on a side street where I could immediately pull over, turn off the car, and have AAA tow to their shop. AAA discovered the issue, pulled the mangled plug out of my pump. Repair job costing me a few hundred dollars. I say lucky, because it could have been far worse, like the car is on the highway moving to another state and/or I completely lose the engine. I would be leery of their work. Especially with a safety concern. The attention to detail they once had, is and has been gone for some time now. Your better off doing the work yourself or taking it to AAA. The local AAA shop on E. Valley Auto Drive has been great these past few years, saved my car, talk the issue out with me, show me the parts they removed, etc.. They are worth every penny!"
0,"we came by for lunch after checking out. i wanted nachos and mama wanted a salad. i figured this would be an ideal spot to facilitate those needs.\n\nthe hostess who sat us was not very pleasant. she tried to seat us at the bar section, on a bar table. mind you, we have our luggage with us and didn't ask to be seated at the bar. when i asked her for a dining room booth, she looked less than thrilled to be burdened with this task. she may have even rolled her eyes behind her glasses. \n\nour server was a nicer individual. we ordered nachos and mama had a cobb salad. mama gets picky with her orders sometimes. this time she didn't get \""too\"" picky. she did ask for NO bleu cheese though. we thought it was simple enough. i also asked for a lemon for my water. needless to say, i point those items out because they were not accomplished. the nachos were good and mama tolerated her salad. we ordered dessert, the brownie with ice cream. that was real good. \n\nwould've gone with 3 stars, cause the server was nice. but, the hostess and the missed items make me have to drop one. call it 2.5"
1,"SIMPLY THE BEST!    Had Lunch Express cater an office party and they did a top notch job!  The food was just wonderful and the presentation was much better than what you would think a simple little lunch-stop would do.  The are NOT just a \""Lunch Express\"" go-to place, but also breakfast!  Joe really cares and is wonderful at what he does. If you haven't tried this place--please DO!  Bravo and Thanks!"
1,"Great spot for wine and drinks. Lite menu but very tasty snacks. Flatbreads were outstanding, especially the chorizo, anduoille one, and just what we were looking for as we wanted to duck out of the hustle of the casino and just have some conversation."
0,"Not for me.  Pictures on Yelp are very appealing, but taste and quality of food did not match their appearance.  Highlights for me were wicked chicken wings and watermelon salad.  Meat (bacon and prime rib) slices were 80% fat.  I am all for marbling in my meat, but come on.  Shrimp we're also overcooked and mush inside.  Desserts were more pretty than good.  Dessert attendant also had some questionable hygiene practices when dishing out ice cream with only gloved hand.  Sat near ice cream cooler so witnessed this several times.  Had always thought I had never really ate at the right buffet in Vegas to find one I liked, but I thought this to be a higher end and after my forth different one...I am still disappointed.  Done with buffets in Vegas."
1,"I can't usually do a buffet justice but I went back four times for more food. It had some of the best variety I've ever seen. There was sushi, endless shrimp and crab legs, muscles, clams, crawfish, oysters...all delicious. There was an olive, meat, and cheese area. Thought I died and went to heaven. I was able to try out some Mediteranian food which I'd never had before. The list goes on and on.\n\nOur waitress was quick to replenish drinks and wisk away dirty plates. She was also very good natured which can make or break any dining experience.\n\nThe dessert portion was meh but I'm not a huge dessert person. \n\nWe had a 2 for 1 coupon which helped keep costs down. We ended up paying just under $20 each. It is a costly buffet but well worth it. I'm dreaming about the day we can go back."
0,"This location is rather small for a Borders, I am not impressed by it at all, except that they are open extremely late."
0,Service was great but food was disappointing. Pork belly was too greasy and my short ribs were way too sweet. Mashed parsnips were sickly sweet with an odd aftertaste. The fries with the lamb burger had a strange texture. I don't think they used the right potatoes. \n\n I really wanted to love this place from all the great reviews but am truly left disappointed.
1,Sister Sister  does amazing work.  And they are super fast at what they do.\nI recommend this place for braiding and weaves.
0,"When I walked in and saw the person at the front desk on a personal call, I knew I should have turned around and left. She did not end the call while I stood there. There was no one else in the waiting room. If I was feeling better I would have found some place else to go. \nShe finally finishes her call and acknowledges me. I complete the required paperwork. I go to bring it to her and she is on another call with a patient. She saw me walk up with my paperwork and place it on the counter in front of her. Another person walks in, she ends her call and proceeds to help the next person, after taking all her info she stands up and says to me \""why didn't you tell me you completed your paperwork\"". I did not even answer her as I knew I would have been rude. She calls me up, tells me I have to pay completes the transaction. I sit back down. The lady from back calls me back. Asks what is wrong, asks about medicines I am taking and my history. I am telling her everything, and she keeps asking me how do you spell it. Everything I said she could not spell. OK, I know medicines and diagnosis are not easy to spell but seriously, I was getting pretty annoyed at this. Plus all the while she is sniffling, I was already sick and the last thing I need is for it to get worse. \nThe Doctor came in a few minutes later, and says hello and says you have the flu. Alrighty then, I could have told her that myself. that is why I have not gone anywhere till today. She finally says well let me take a look, we are talking about my headaches, she says well I can't diagnosis headaches, you should to to the ER for a cat scan. That was it for me. A cat scan for the flu. She tells me to rest for two more days she will give me a note for my employer. Pick up the note up front. I get back to the front ask for my note. My favorite receptionists says we only give those if you ask. I reply the Doctor told me to come get it, not the other way around. I honestly could not take another minute of this so called urgent care. I said i do not need the note and left. I do not need the note. I do not call in to work, so I am not worried. \nThe bottom line is this place is a sham for an urgent care. If you are ill, honestly go to your own Dr. if you can, Even quick care is better than this. \nI give it two stars because my crankiness may be playing a part in how I am writing this. I am trying to be fair., by taking into consideration I do not feel well."
1,"This place is good, and for how good pretty damn affordable."
0,"Terrible! Terrible! Terrible! The only reason I went here was because Miller's Ale House was packed for Monday Night Football. They seemed to have decent specials, but the worst service. \n\nWe had a party of 8 and were drinking and ordering food in front of the big screen. We constantly had to wait forever for any food and drinks and had to get the terrible server numerous times. Food sucked and tasted like crap. The only good thing was the beer. \n\nLong after the game was over, we were waiting for our bill and to pay which literally took us getting the manager, who was just as slow. \n\nGood bye! This place is done and will not last long at all. STAY AWAY!!!"
1,"I've used Brand X multiple times for gifts as well as recreational team shirts. Whether ordering 3 shirts or more than 15, the Brand X team has always been super helpful and quick to respond to my needs. They have a great turnaround time and have always had my items ready well before my deadline. I am so appreciative of their flexibility, creativity, and patience - they are my first choice for custom print jobs hands down!"
0,"This is your typical greasy american style grill diner breakfast place.  Given that there are no other close breakfast place, you take what you can get, but it is still a disappointment given all the other rave reviews.\n\nLet me start with the coffee cake.  Please don't order this.  It is made with a generic white cake mix that is not even very good mixed in with some cinnamon mix and white frosting.  Actually, it is pretty gross to eat for breakfast.  \n\nYou know there is a question of quality when all of the menu items are put in \""quotations\"".  Enjoy the \""Fresh-squeezed\"" OJ as long as you realize it may be fresh squeezed, but it is the worst quality and cheapest OJ they apparently could get their hands on.  We had a variety of breakfast items including french toast, pancakes and some special \""hash\"" item that is supposed to be a specialty.  I wouldn't order any of it again.  \n\nOn a positive note the service was excellent and someone in our party got a hamburger (for breakfast??) but at least I can say everyone at our table really enjoyed the french fries.\n\nAgain, at a minimum please DO NOT order the coffee cake, some of the worst breakfast sweets I have ever had anywhere."
1,"Service was good.  Started with a plate of oysters.  Selection was great, multiple kinds with varying degrees of sizes.  Waiter was knowledgeable on the differences between the oysters.  Main meal was the clam bake which was phenomenal."
1,"GET SOME!!\ngo now seriously and get some.\n\nThis place is easily now my top favorite mexican food joint in all of phoenix. Great cheap prices. There are three types of mexican restaurant places i go. 1) I have to for some reason. 2) I want some mexican food and this place was around. and 3) I crave this place in particular.\n\nThis place falls into my number 3 category easily. I literally love the guy at the register, he was really friendly and knew his menu well. That is always a good thing when your workers actually know the menu (i think he might be the owner). It is a small place, outdoor seating if you wish and pretty clean considering the outside aesthetics. \n\nThe food:\n\nFish Tacos - Grade: A+, the fish was fresh and crunchy, the sauce was nice and tangy, the cabbage was crisp and fresh. The sauce and the lime were in perfect harmony.\n\nQuesadilla -  Grade: A+crunchy corn tortilla, um for real, soo simple yet soo delicious, crunchy all the way through, generous amounts of cheese made each bite memorable\n\nTamales (spicy chicken) - Grade:  A, i wish the maiz was a little softer, but the texture was still good. I was hoping for the chicken to be spicier but i have a pallet for spicy pain... Even though it didn't get a plus it was still really good, just wasn't what i was expecting so a slight let down\n\nPerro Oaxaca - Grade: A, the Oaxacan version of the Sonoran Hot Dog...still my votes go sonoran all the way through and through. This was REALLLY tasty still, but my only step fuss was, too much mayo on it, if it was SPICY mayo i wouldn't mind too much...\nMy opinion for the mayo is, either do light mayo, or do a chipotle mayo and put that one top...that would be great.\n\n\nGlad i have found a mexican food joint i love on my side of town. I'll be back in a week when i start to crave it again."
0,"It's quite appropriate that something in Las Vegas would choose to host a $9 million habitat for lions. Even more appropriate that it's in that one resort with a logo of a gold lion. Sure, it would attract spectators who might potentially spend time in the casino and other attractions at the MGM. Except, there are people who've been to the MGM a great deal of times and yet never felt inclined to visit the Lion Habitat. (Me?)\n\nIt seems I'm one of the few that was unimpressed by this extraordinary display of wealth & kitschy attempt at grandeur. When I last went in January, however, I was with a friend who hadn't been to Vegas for 15 years and stopped as we passed it on our way to the Rainforest Cafe. We saw one very bored looking lioness. Awesome.\n\nIf I really wanted to see lions, I'd go back to one the few wildlife habitats located around the world, especially those I've visited a number of times as a kid: the conveniently located Taman Safari in Indonesia, the Night Safari in Singapore, or the Wild Animal Park in San Diego."
1,"What a beautiful space! Thankfully, lululemon is utilizing the grassy area for spring/summer outdoor yoga.  The City of Charlotte (?) keeps this area so nice & well-kept.  \n\nPlenty of people use this area to walk, run, & the kids use it to play. As Casandra mentioned, there is some nice art to look at.  Additionally, the stone archways make for a nice backdrop for photography/picture taking.\n\nThe only downside is you have to park at The Met, since there isn't any street parking."

0,"My husband and I were in search of a bakery to make a cake for our sons 9th birthday, this place was recommended to us by a friend. We had everything all paid for about three weeks in advance so that the cake would be ready to pick up at 8:00am the morning of our sons party which was in the afternoon that day. \n\nThat Saturday morning I received a phone call as I'm on the way to our sons double header basketball game that the image that was supposed to go on my sons cake somehow was misplaced or lost and that we needed to send them the image again. My husband went back and forth with the people who seemed to be pretty incompetent with the entire situation and not very helpful. Also they didn't seem all that concerned that they screwed up the day of our sons birthday! \n\nAfter thinking we had it all straightened out, my husband went to pick up the cake in between our sons basketball games. When he arrived, guess what? Cake wasn't what we asked for. The entire top of the cake was supposed to be the whole Minecraft edible image. Instead it was a tiny comic strip of the image in the middle of the cake. We are now only a few hours until our sons party and any solution that was offered was not helpful! They offered our money back, but to us it wasn't about the money, getting what we asked for was!  Then we were offered a cake delivery later that afternoon with the CORRECT cake, again, not helpful because the party was in a few hours. The staff was rude on the phone, rude in person, the owner had an attitude and wasn't very professional to deal with even after admitting fault! Not to mention that my husband missed the first half of our sons second basketball game dealing with this nonsense!!!\n\nYou know, even after admitting they screwed up, they could've at least acted like they cared! But they didn't. When dealing with customers when you screw up, you need to have a little bit of compassion for crying out loud! \n\nSo a little lesson was learned here. The saying we all know and use,  \""You get what you pay for\""  Well in this situation it wasn't the case. When I pay $100 for a birthday cake, I expect it to be ready when it's supposed to be, I expect it to be what I asked for and what was agreed upon. There should be no excuses from a so-called professional bakery. \n\nI do not recommend this place if you're used to getting great professional service from people with a smile......."
1,"Joel's is amazing!  Except for their price.Ok, I was ready to pony up for dinner for my mom and I, which I didn't mind.... until I found out what they charged me for. She got the veal while I got something with veggies. We received this tomato gazpacho that released steam which was a cool effect, complimentary, I supppose.  I absolutely enjoyed the bread cart (make sure to stuff yourself if you are only getting the two course meal because they are to die for, I loved the oregano bread!) when I told them it was my moms birthday they brought a beautiful tray of desserts as well as access to the wonderful dessert cart.  I thoroughly enjoyed the meal  as did my mom.  But I was shocked that the bill charged not only 7 dollars for a glass of soda, they charged for each glass we drank which was 7 between the two of us ( most of them were mine because I was so thirsty because the glasses were tiny!). I wanted to say something about it, but I didn't want to discuss it in front of my mom because show would have balked at the price. Be prepared for a lovely dinner that will charge you for every penny they can!  I would go again but will not order a soda."
1,"Connie and the rest of the staff were amazing! We didn't know exactly what we were looking for, but she walked us through all of our options, and the plaque came out looking fantastic. The price was great, the staff was very knowledgeable, and they really went the extra mile for us. When Connie found out this was a surprise gift, she even made sure to call my cell phone before emailing me any questions or proofs, just in case I wasn't the only one at my computer. I would recommend Tempe Trophy to everyone!"
0,"Oh I came to this place I was walking down street. They had a temporary menu which had some misspelled words on it.. OMG... I was so expecting this place to be MUCH MUCH better.. I was told the owner \""big mama\""  was on a much needed vaction. So someone else was cooking ,and trust me from what I ordered, you can clearly tell somethings missing.. I also should have known something was going to be wrong when I saw on the temporary menu w/ misspelled words.. I ordered the pulled pork sandwich w/ baked beans... Both were HORRIBLE.. It was a complete waste of money.. I don't think I would ever eat here again when I visit Pittsburgh.. And I really wanted this place to be good.. but they need to STEP IT UP A COUPLE OF NOTCHES."

0,I went to kona grill - around happy hour and sat at the bar by myself- idk if the drain was clogged but the bar could not have smelled worse. It was appalling- I initially blew it off thinking maybe it would change - then I lifted my arms and my sweater stuck to the bar - i ordered a bud light - happy hour price was average. I did not stay to eat though- could you blame me?
1,"I am into Techno/Trance/Electro music so far that I am living in Edinburgh as a student for 3 months, I had not found a better disco/club than liquid rooms which offer this type of music (perhaps that's why 4 star not 3). In fact the music quality, DJ-set, and type of music is amazing and perfectly to my liking. I went 3 times so far, twice was techno and once trance and I both endured till 3am, when they close.\n\nHowever there are things that I did not like compared to clubbing in my country I come from. First of the entrance price is high 10-12pound. Secondly, things start getting nice and warm around midnight (a bit late), and then within 1 hour the dance floor tend to be packed up and you end up loosing a bit of the fun. Nevertheless, one of the nights was not so packed and I really enjoyed myself.  Crowd is very nice coming from all  the spectrum of the society, on average mid-20s to 30s, and there is a certain feel of party.  \n\n I don't drink much, but I thought the prices were a bit high. To put the coat in a secure place, that's another 1pound. If this place was bigger and the price is about half as much, it will one of the best music clubs ever and would see lots of 5 stars. There were bodyguards at the entrance (checking ad hoc) and inside."
1,"I had lunch here the other day with a few girls from work. This is another place that you need to come at 11:30 or 12:30. The service was ok. I am hoping it was just our waitress and that she was just having a bad day, but she didn't really seem to care about serving us. \nThe food was really good and came out quickly! (hopefully that is a sign they will survive downtown). I had a chicken pita which was fairly good. HUGE, way too much for me to eat. The fries were also delicious. \nBoth of the girls also loved their food. One had the flounder and the other had the Carolina burger. \nWe will be adding this to our regular lunch rotation. With the looks of the drink specials we might also be adding it to happy hours."
0,This hotel is full of people that don't sleep and look cracked out. Went to hooters restaurant and the hostess ladies were chit chatting and instead of seating us when they saw us they kept talking. Literally we checked the bed for bugs because this hotel is so gross.
0,So I don't eat sushi but I went for a batch party and the bride along with the other 10 girls I went with all eat sushi these girls had nothing but complaints about the food.  They said it is so over priced for the quality of food they also said they wouldn't go back next time they go to Vegas.  Since I don't eat sushi I was left with almost nothing to eat I could either get 2 tiny chicken squares or a $35 steak and that was not what I wanted right before heading out to the bars so I got the tiny chicken and edemame which was not filling but those were my choices.
1,"A lovely oasis of elegant, yet personal, table service in a mecca of fast food lunch joints and chain restaurants by Greenway Plaza.\n\nExtensive menu selection, delicate spicing, refined presentation--all served by waitstaff who clearly know their menu and are enthusiastic about it. Attentive service , yet unobtrusive--no \"" hi, I'm Patel, your new best friend \"" business--just genuine care and grace about your experience.\n\nAll dishes are served promptly (no worries, office park crowd)--in lovely crockery and china, with starched cloth napkins and substantial silverware--no sporks here--creating an atmosphere of grace and relaxation--even during a busy lunch hour. \nQuiet enough to hold a conversation without employing lipreading skills--another plus.\n\n(No typical Indian buffet scene to ensure you'll get the flu bug either.)\n\nDhaba also offers take out menu to consider for dinner when commuting home. \n\nBest basmati rice in town--all very reasonably priced."
1,"Really enjoyed this place ... our group of 4 were able to grab a sofa in the lounge area (towards the front of the restaurant) on a Saturday around noon to watch some college football.  The waitresses were extremely attentive (and drop-dead gorgeous).  We were the only ones near one of the larger TVs, so we requested they change the channel to a certain game.  The manager came by and confirmed with us what game we wanted and promptly put it on that game.  So far so good.  \n\nI read a few tips on Foursquare, and most beer lovers said to get a beer called \""Moose Drool Brown Ale\"", which was brewed by Big Sky Brewery out of Montana.  Boy were they right about that ... great beer.  I would highly recommend it as well.  Prices were up there (it is a spot in the Venetian after all), but not at LA or NYC levels.  I ordered the Pub Burger and it was one of the best burgers I've ever had.\n\nMy Quick and Dirty review ... \n\nAtmosphere - Great (had a cigar bar feel to it (without the smoke) ... dimly lit, leather couches, big TVs, attractive waitresses, etc.)\nFood/Drinks - Fantastic (phenomenal beer selection and one of the best burgers I've ever had)\nService - Good (very attentive and helpful in recommending beers ... did I mention attractive waitresses?)\n\nSummary - If you are a beer lover, this is a must-see in Sin City.  If you are NOT a beer lover, I would still recommend it (just get a glass of wine instead)."
0,"This place does not know anything about Mercedes Benz oil changes so please use caution. They did my oil change and when I left my oil level indicator came up, also it was supposed to be a synthetic oil change which is supposed to be changed every 5,000 Miles but they put a sticker to come back after 3,000. I took it back and the first technician had only filled up 4 quarts instead of the required 8 quarts. They also broke my oil sensor in which I had to take to the dealership to get fixed, thank god I had a warranty on it. When I came back to complain they quickly changed the 3k sticker to 5k and said \""sorry.\"" This place might be good for normal cars but if you are driving a luxury car, do not take it here! Have a good day and drive safe"
0,"Booked a table for 1 through Opentable. When I got there, I was told they would seat me at the bar because the tables were reserved for family style dinner and the portions are designed for sharing food. Ridiculous argument. If I book a table through Opentable, I expect a table, not a barstool."
1,"Arrived to Merchant at around 7:30pm on Friday night and found the place to be quite full.  After checking-in with the hostess, we made our way to the bar, where as luck would have it, 2 seats opened-up.  The wait for a table was only going to be 20 minutes; bar seats trump any wait, so we pulled our names from the wait list.\n\nA friendly bartender introduced himself, offered drink and food menus, and gave us a minute or two.  We browsed the cocktail menu and decided on an Old Fashioned and a tap from Lake Louie.\n\nThe bar area at Merchant is nice; heavy timber, wide and spacious with comfy seats, and a perfectly placed toe rail made for great dining/drinking spot.  The patrons around us were friendly and engaging; one of them offered us a bite of her roasted beet entree, and we obliged - that's how friendly/chill the place is.\n\nAfter perusing the menu and once again not being able to decide on an entree, we opted to sample a few appetizers.  Based on a tip from one of our bar neighbors, we ordered the mussels.  We also ordered the roasted bone marrow and the local cheese plate.\n\nThe food arrived after a short wait, and we immediately dove into the mussels.  Divine.  Truly divine.  The wine sauce was amazing; the rustic bread that accompanied the mussels was hearty yet chewy - perfect for transporting that awesome broth from the bowl to my beak.\n\nNeither of us had tried bone marrow before, but we both loved it.  The presentation was wonderful, and the parsley butter (with shallot) that was served on top of the marrow helped accent the meaty flavor.  Thick slabs of grilled Texas toast were served on the side; the marrow spread like butter on the toast and was so silky smooth and phenomenal.\n\nThe local cheese plate featured three cheeses, including my all-time fave, Dunbarton Blue.  Local honey and a nice cranberry compote rounded out the dish.  \n\nThe check arrived and was more than reasonable, especially given the quality of what we sampled.  Service was excellent, and the bartenders did a great, great job of making really excellent suggestions to us.  \n\nMerchant = WIN\n\nFood = 4.25 stars\nService = 4.5 stars\nValue = 4 stars\nMISC = 4 stars\n\nI could see this becoming a regular hangout..."
1,"I typically only go to Royal when I'm at the Farmers' Market on Saturday mornings.  It's probably their busiest time, but they are pretty efficient, and the wait is never long.  I typically get an iced coffee or skinny latte.  They are tasty, but I am no coffee snob.  I love that there's no \""extra-hot, extra foam, yadda yadda\"" b.s., like at some other places.  Inside, it's pretty cramped, and the seating is not comfortable.  Plus, I really dislike high-top tables.  But there are other, more pleasant seating options.  There's inside the Public Market, outside, on the grapevine-festooned patio, or, on Saturday mornings, in the \""food court\"" section of the outdoor market, where you also have the added touch of live local music."
1,"I can only not give five stars because I don't know what my favorite MLB stadium is yet. Not only because I haven't been to all of them but even among the dozen or so I have been to, I can't rank them like that. The night we went to PNC was pretty perfect though.\n\nThe walk across the bridge is a nice experience unto itself and the view from either end was really kind of exciting. I don't live in Pittsburgh and when I visit my friends there, I rarely get a glimpse of what a good-looking city it is. The bridge totally does that, as does the stadium itself. Having the skyline as a backdrop was really nice.\n\nThe statues and the street concert were also a nice touch but for an otherwise well-designed stadium, it was kind of a pain to get to our section. Maybe we did it wrong, but the zig zag meander with the masses goes on far too long before we can split off into the 100s or 200s or 300s. Lots of other stadiums cut to the chase and send you in the right direction sooner it seems to me. But like I always say, if you want to watch the (insert MLB team name here) play at home, where else you gonna go?\n\nThe food selection was really quite impressive though it was so friggin' hot the night we went we didn't partake. If we had, I know there would have been a Polish Hill dog (with pierogies on it) and a gluten-free hot dog as well. Gluten-free! Way to go, Pittsburgh, you've just out-L.A.'d, L.A."
0,"Dishonest.. try to scam you... very unprofessional!!  Let me explain...\n\n*** QUOTED ME A PRICE... $35 went up to $150\n*** TOOK ADVANTAGE OF THAT I NEED MY GLASSES\n*** KEPT ENCOURAGING ME TO LEAVE SO THEY COULD GO SMOKE.\n\nCalled and explained my situation... My frames are a little cracked between the nose piece and metal that goes around the lenses.  I was told if it wasn't broke off... it could be done in an hour and would be around $35.  I was excited so headed down there.  When I got there I showed them my frames and they then said... you can't see without these.  Well... clearly that's why I wanted them fixed before they broke.  She started to bend on them a bit and I asked her to be careful.  She walked in back and spoke to a blonde lady.  After talking for a while they told me it was \""SO BAD IT would take overnight to fix and cost $85.  There was no way I could leave without my glasses and they knew this.  As I was leaving... they offered to fix them tomorrow but charge me over $150 and it would take about an hour.  Kept telling me to come back tomorrow and before I was to my car... (parked right outside the door) they were out smoking."

0,"Went to Downtown Summerlin location based on a recommendation. Arrived about 8:30, web says it opens at 8. Doors locked, employees looking at us from inside, don't bother to come to the door. Went to another door. Employee sitting a table drinking coffee doesn't come to the door. Apparently they were closed and it was too much of an effort for one of the employees inside to come to the door on a cold morning and let the 3 customers know why. With the growth of restaurants in Summerlin, this is the fastest way to grow bust. I typically write a review after I've dined in the restaurant but in this case their behavior speaks to me about the nature of this place. Doubt we will give it another try, too many other options."
0,Place was dirty and did not serve vegetarians. They guy said over the phone they did. Otherwise nice people.
1,"We loved this place since they were located next to the Smith's on Flamingo, small intimate, but then they expanded to their location on Spring Mountain, it was big and very nicely decorated but they closed up even though it always appeared to be busy, we thought they were gone for good, but then we discovered their newest location at Village square and are enjoying once again great food and service. \n\nI love the happy hour, who doesnt love margaritta's! They serve roasted onions and jalapena with radish, soup with the meal and they gave us complmentary desert. \n\nI chose the combination plate, chili relleno, beef taco and chili verde enchilada. It was very good. My husband got a steak it was grilled and very tender! It was a good meal. Always good food great service and good margaritta's!"
1,I came here with a friend for one of the bbq'ing pool parties. The decor is warm and comfy. The pool is big and the jacuzzi rocks! The owner John was manning  the grill. We had a blast!
1,"Great variety and very good quality for a buffet - especially the dessert bar!  The service was very good, epecially considering we had a large party."
0,"You have to take another shuttle from the Mccarran Rental Car Center, minus one star. They have  the new Fiats on site but will only rent them to you if your considering buying it, minus another star. They advise you to take the insurance because they say Nevada is a no fault state. Which means and I quote \""you rent the car until the repairs are Done\"", minus another star. And last but not least, two days later you see a $200.00 charge on your credit card that should only be $50.00 minus another star. So my original quote of $30.00 was not worth all this hassle! So that leaves this review with one star and they are lucky to get that!"
1,"Just like Papago Brew, but with better beer, better food and WAY BETTER service.\n\nSeriously, these guys know whats up.  Great happy hour on the local AZ beers at $6 for a pitcher (just over 2 beers).  They have an excellent selection and variety *gasp of beer on draft, but have the tendency to run out of beers rapidly.  I would consider this to be a good thing because they will always be getting a new, fresh keg of something delicious.\n\nFood is excellent and there is a variety of meat and veg dishes from which to choose.  Most importantly, you order and they bring it promptly.  \n\n5 stars because they have an awesome sour beer on draft...Petrus aged Pale.  If you go to OHSO, do yourself a favor and give it a try."
0,"4 people, $70. Not worth it.\n\nI come to vegas almost annually and these restaurants change frequently.\nSimply put:\nThey have taiwanese food, bad taiwanese food.\nThere were four of us and we ordered 2 of the same things, and 2 different dishes.\nPortions were too small and taste was only average.\n\nMy noodles came out really quick.....the other same order of noodles didn't come out until everything else came out.\nEverything else including dishes that came out and were taken back and then brought back out again because the order was confused.\nwhen eating the noodles, there were a ton of corn starch clumps in both bowls.\nCorn starch is an ingredient, not a garnish.\nWe were actually told that after my bowl came out they ran out so thanks for telling me i got the old soup and they were making a fresh pot.\n\nHere's the temperature problem. It was only about 10 degrees higher in the restaurant than it was outside. So if you're looking to sweat like a pregnant nun and overpay, proceed. I wouldn't be surprised if they were gone by our trip next year."
1,They have a good lunch special and happy hour prices. I have never been there for regular menu prices to know what the cost is.
0,"While visiting my father who was admitted to St. Joseph, I had to get my Americano fix. The first day, I felt like the barista was irritated that I had asked if they had a canister of non-fat milk.\n\nThe second day I had brought a 2nd visit coupon from another location. The offer said $2.00 iced drink after 2PM, which sounded great. The same barista, the one with the mullet, was quick to point out the fine print \""Participating Locations Only\"" with a nasty attitude. When I told him that I didn't feel right buying full priced Starbucks drinks twice in a day, he rolled his eyes and said \""Oh well, YOUR LOSS!\""\n\nSo today, I made every effort to get my coffee elsewhere. I usually look for the non-corporate coffee shop, however, in this neighborhood it seems like the only options for quick espresso drinks in this area the Starbucks peppered all over the downtown area.\n\nThe staff here made me really appreciate the Starbucks by my house as well as all of those small independently owned shops that I really enjoy so much more.\nIf you must get your Starbucks and you are going to the St. Joe's, GET IT ON THE WAY, NOT HERE!"
1,"My family was invited to stay at Aria several times and finally accepted the offer for free rooms.  I am so happy that they did!  It is beautiful and the room is so great.  From the moment you walk in, you realize it is going to be different.  \n\nThe casino is classy and modern.  It is perfect.  I feel right at home with the modern dark woods and stainless steel accents.  The security at the elevators was great.  The Jean Phillips Pattiserie next to the elevators means you never have to leave the hotel hungry or thirsty and allows you to grab a quick snack till midnight.  \n\nThe rooms are perfect.  The control 4 system is easy as pie.  If you can use a smart phone, you will be fine.  I am spoiled now, and will want a control 4 system at home now.  \n\nThere is a beautiful shower and our view was great.  We would live to get a condo here...maybe some day we will.  There seems to be time left to buy in.\n\nThe dealer that we had for the spin the wheel thing, Nic was so lovely.  He was very interesting to talk to and was very helpful with playing the game my first time.  It was relaxed and a newly married couple filtered through from Australia as well as a couple from Mexico City that won $800.  \n\nThe shopping at Aria is great and I would love to pick a few things up I am eyeing including a solar powered backpack and Dior slides.  Also on my wish list are some spa clothes. (That is were they hide the nice comfy Aria brand merch.).  \n\nThe mall is a fantasy.  It has little tornados in tubes of water and computerized ice sculptures, a 2 story Tiffany and Louis Vuitton.  The Xerasacaping around City Center is the best I've seen, even living in LA.  \n\nI am a fan of Aria and hope to come back soon.  I will try the shuttle to Bellagio tonight from Crystals tonight to see the gardens there and then go up the Eiffel tower to see the fountains.  Last night at Aria is going to be great!"
0,"Coming to this McDonald's is like a box of chocolates, cause you never know what a your going to get. A smorgasbord of different experiences. \n\nParked for an iced coffee the last visit and then when it came it tasted like they gave up waiting for fresh coffee and brought me what they had left over from the night before...bitter. Two sips and out the window it went (I kept the cup, I did not litter). Seriously...parked for an iced coffee???  Plus they give me my HOT food to wait for a cold drink. \n\nWithout writing a book, my experience dictates that this location should only be visited during rush hours. The staff seems to lack the mental capacity to understand anything about quality, communication or consistency. \n\nManagement, I highly recommend you re-train your staff on actual McDonald's corporate procedures and learn the guidelines on what is considered fresh...and how to read a clock."
1,Excellent food and service in a quant restaurant. They've got a nice wine selection as well!
0,"I'm actually kind of floored that there are ANY decent reviews of this place. It is DIRTY. The stations have clearly not been cleaned in a long time. The UV light machine where I put my hands to dry...I was kind of retching a little. Greasy and grimy and with actual layers of other people's dead skin cells. Seriously disgusting. On top of that, the gal who did my nails did this very creative filing job where my nails were u-shaped. U-shaped. Not kidding. Looked like a little elf had taken a bite out of the end of each nail. I have no idea who taught this girl this technique. Perhaps this is a new fad somewhere in the world. I was so floored that I just paid, went home and filed my nails, and have never returned since.\n\nI would like to reiterate how dirty this place is. I had \""HEALTH HAZARD\"" flashing in my head in red lights the whole time, and I'm not very high maintenance about that kind of stuff. I can't believe I didn't just get up and go. I think I was too shocked.\n\nBlech. Never again."
1,"Oh my gggggawwwwwd. If i ever want to get really fat i'm just going to live here and go nuts eating crepes and quiche while drinking whipped cream covered cappuccinos. I came here with three other friends on a recent trip to Montreal and all of us had to roll out of the restaurant after. It's the kind of place you go to where the portions are huge but you still eat the whole thing because it's so damn good.\n\nOne of my friends and i got seafood crepes, which was delicious because- lets face it- everything is good when it's covered in baked cheese and is filled with rich, creamy bechamel sauce. Another friend got a bacon and avocado crepe, which he said was good, but after seeing the deliciousness of our seafood crepes he felt like he could have made a better selection. Another friend got the quiche, which looked amaziiiiing. The crust seemed really golden and flakey. My cappuccino was also delicous... And that would be because it arrived covered in whipped cream and chocolate powder. If they had asked i would have said no whipped cream to try make a tiny attempt at being healthy, but if it arrives that way i'm not gonna complain!\n\nI'll definitely be back here next time I'm in Montreal! I try to eat healthy, but when i don't i love splurging on food like this- so damn good and totally worth the food coma!!"
1,"5 stars for lunch options and value, 2.5 stars for lunchtime sushi.\n4 stars for dinner, 4 stars for dinner sushi.\n\nThis place has two faces - a simple and incredible value during lunch (4$ tasty lunch bento boxes...are you KIDDING?), and then a full blown, non-corporate teppan-yaki at night.\n\nI definitely tend to notice a difference in the quality of the sushi between lunch and dinner with the latter being preferable.  Dinner options are delicious and great fun, but the amazing dimension Kyoto brings to downtown Scottsdale are its lunch offerings.  Seriously, they're good, and under 5 bucks.  That alone makes it worth the trip!"
0,Here's why it's one star ... BALLY'S CLOSED IT DOWN.\n\nToo bad. I used to love this place. \n\nWhat the heck is going on at Bally's?
1,Friendly attentive service. $2 for a small wash load that take about 23 mins. Small load dries in about 30 mins for $4. Why have I never thought about taking my comforters to a laundromat instead of dry cleaning or sticking in my machine at home with tennis balls bouncing in the dryer? I can't believe I was in and out in less then 45 mins after washing and drying a small load.
0,"Worst place ever. Homeless live behind the dumpsters. I had an ant problem and several leaks; one case my whole apartment flooded when I was washing my clothes and I woke up to the washer overflowing. I was kicked out of my apartment for 4 days, it was that bad.  Cheap inside and out. Look elsewhere. Only good thing about this place is they give away free rattler tickets. \n\nI feel sorry for the next person who moves Into my old apartment, nothing but trouble. \n\nKEEP LOOKING."
1,"I have delivery-ordered a Veggie Pizza (with spinach and sausage) from Happy's Pizza on three occasions within the past few months over your mainstream pizza joints, such as Papa Johns, Pizza Hut, Dominos, etc due to the fact I enjoyed my Veggie Pizza (with spinach and sausage)! \n\nEvery time I have ordered a Veggie pizza from other places, I usually complain how there is not enough veggies (what can I say? I love my veggies!) but Happy's Pizza has proven to be different. From the three occasions I have ordered my pizza, it never fails - FRESH veggies are overflowing on top of each other! \n\nI should try other dishes to give it more reviews, but what can I say? When I'm in the mood for pizza, I call Happy's!"

1,"Jekyll and Hyde is the ONLY place I've drank Innis & Gunn all night, from start to finish, from woe to go, from crack to thump. For those of you who haven't tried Innis & Gunn, it's REALLY potent and tastes so good you just fly through them. This was a problem at Jekyll and Hyde.\n\nThe night in question wasn't a busy one and there were plenty of staff on, but for some reason service was SLOOOW. Mega slow. I was waiting 5 - 10 minutes in a one-person-deep line. This was not cool, my pal and I were commiserating a dirty break-up and needed alcohol swift and constant, not slow and sporadic. So I started buying two drinks each per line-up, then eventually three each. I don't like to do this because I can't control myself; I drink quick and hard and get too drunk too early. Which is precisely what happened.  \nAfter a few hours our table was COMPLETELY covered with empty bottles. Completely. When the glass dude came to clear them away he was all like \""Are these all yours?\"" and we were like \""(unintelligible sounds)\"". \n\nAnd then the guy was like \""Impressive!\""\n\nIn one passive action, I stopped caring that the service was slow, the tables sticky and the music not to my liking. We had impressed the staff at a heavy-drinking establishment with the amount we had drunk! Bar-cred for us!\n\nIf you don't mind your bars a little bit sticky and scrappy and with a 'who gives a fuck' attitude, give Jekyll and Hyde a whirl. Just make sure you know where the bathroom is before you need to break the seal."

0,"Very pricey...at least compared to normal yogurt places such as Yogurtland. The yogurt itself is very creamy...together. It's actually a bit too creamy for me as I wanted a more yogurt-y feel rather than eating the many gelato places all over the strip. Anyway, this is what I tried:\n\nCheesecake: Definitely reminds me of a sour cream/cream cheese mix, but VERY, very creamy.\n\nTart: I honestly thought you couldn't go too wrong with plain tart, but it was creamy and way too sour. There was really no flavor to it; just creamy sourness...if that's even a flavor.\n\nChocolate: Again, a bit of a disappointment. It did taste better than most of the other yogurts, but it wasn't too satisfying. I guess it's one of those \""I'll eat it if I have to since I'm craving CHOCOLATE AND I NEED IT NOW!!!\"" last resorts.\n\nPistachio: Absolutely no flavor. Just a sweet icy thing. Hideous.\n\nStrawberry: This one was my favorite. It was pretty much the only edible thing there...actually tasted like strawberries and cream. Again, not the best by far, but certainly edible.\n\nOverall, I am definitely still on my search to find a decent yogurt place in Vegas..."

1,"I have been waiting with much anticipation for Mother Bunch to open, and am very happy to say they are a great addition to the downtown/Roosevelt area. I went with the husband yesterday for a pint and some wings. Upon entering, you can see that they put a lot of work into making this an open and neat looking space. The bar is in the center with tables all around it (including large tables that have church pews as the benches.... awesome!). They have many beers on tap, mostly local, all craft brews. Our waitress was very nice and helpful, she could see I was waffling on which beer to order and offered to bring a sample of the beer I was debating on. Not only did she bring the sample of the requested beer, but also a sample of another beer she thought I might like... how nice is that? I ended up getting the Deer Lord, which I have never had before, and liked it very much. The husband had the Scottsdale Blonde (and he liked that, ha). We received our wings quickly and it was a huge pile of wings. They had a good ratio of drumstick to wing (I don't know about you, but most everyone I know prefers the drumsticks and when a restaurant only gives you one or two, that can be a problem). The flavor of the wings was good, very different than most, very smokey. I do wish they had the same flavor but with added spiciness... they needed more kick in my opinion. Other than that, they were good. The waitress also sold me on the apple cake with salted caramel gelato and beer infused whipped cream (I'll admit, it was an easy sell). She told me it was one of her personal top 5 desserts in Phoenix. When it came out, the sheer size of this slice was daunting. It was a BIG piece of cake. But it was really delicious.... and we ate the whole thing.... we're pigs. It is a slice of an almost caramelized tasting cake with slices of apples on top, which was decent on its own, BUT when paired with the incredible gelato, it was a real winner. The gelato was fantastic, went well with the cake, and even had some bits of chocolate in it (which always helps). The beer whipped cream didn't taste too beer -y, but was delicious cuz... whipped cream...you know. Overall, the dessert was pretty fabulous. I would come back just for the dessert, but I would also like to try their other food items and their beer (once it's made available!). Will be back!\n\nUpdate: I have been back twice - once for brunch and once for beer and mac and cheese. The brunch was fair, but we went on the first day they served it - I'm sure it will be wonderful once the kinks are worked out. It is a great deal though, 10-12$ for a meal and a beer or mimosa.... awesome! I got to try their house brew Saison, which was delicious.... it had a lot of spices in it, but was still light. The real star here, though, (other than the dessert) was the beer mac.... OH MAH Gawd...... That is some of the most delicious mac I have had in Phoenix. It has the perfect amount of beer flavor. I want to come back and just eat beer mac forever (ha). The price is also reasonable (8$), especially for the size of the portion. I will reiterate, will be back!"
0,"Really nice lady, too bad she burned me with the wax and cut me with her tweezers, my private area is a mess right now and actually burns. BTW I've been waxing myself for 3 years so I am experienced. I did it cause sometimes I get lazy, what a wasted Groupon and now I have to wait to heal, so much pain."
0,"Never go here! \nThese people are swindlers! Tried to charge me $130 to check my check engine light. I called my shop back in my hometown, they said they could check it for free, just by checking a code. These people will do anything to squeeze an extra buck out of you if you're getting an oil change."
1,"Honest and approachable the new Toast Breakfast Boutique will most certainly be added to my list of favorites. Located next door to where Drip Coffee Lounge was housed this place is both quirky and comfortable. \n\nIngredients are sourced as local as possible including bread from M.J. Bread and coffee from Xanadu Coffee Co.. The menu is simple and easily approached with only a few items to choose from. \n\nKnowing that the bread if from M.J. I knew this was going to be great and it was. Starting off with the Fig Jam and Mascarpone Cheese on Marbled Rye Toast ($4); I hit the ground running. Each ingredient worked so well naturally together Id order this every time. Roasted Tomatoes with Mozzarella Cheese on Cibatta Toast ($6) was as good as it gets though for breakfast? Oh yeah!\n\nToast also served what they call the N.Y.C. sandwich. Completely custom from the bread up, you choose your egg, meats, cheese and veggies. I tried the perfectly flaky croissant with medium cooked egg, bacon, tomato, spinach and cheddar cheese ($8.50). I was surprised on the first bite when I realized that they actually cooked the egg medium. The yolk was just slightly runny and the whites completely solid, so who ever is cooking in the kitchen knows how to cook an egg right! Next time though I hold the tomato, while tasty on its own I think the sandwich would have been better off without it, dulled the flavors slightly.\n\nAlso tried the ciabatta with hard egg, bacon, onion and Havarti cheese. Once again the egg was perfectly cooked and all of the flavors came through. The ciabatta was perfectly chewy yet not difficult to eat. This combo was a sure fire hit!\n\nFriendly, approachable, interesting and sincere are all qualities that I admire and try to live by. Toast Breakfast Boutique, not only seems to share those same qualities but never pretends to being something it's not."
0,"I cancelled my membership in June, and had signed up for six months of training which also ended in june. July comes along and I am charged for the training that the contract has ended for. I sent an email letting them know about this and was told i would be refunded. Well, i got another charge for august for the training. The contract i signed was six months ending in june. I never signed onto another contract allowing them to take more payments out of my accounts. I was also never refunded the first go around."
1,"There are two locations for this restaurant in Las Vegas, one at the Palms and one at the Planet Hollywood.  I've been to both and both deliver extremely well on their product.  \n\nIf you're looking for a good daytime meal to tide you over between buffets, this is the place.  About $10 gets you a sandwich, drink and chips.  The bread is crisp, the contents are delicious, and in the end, you're left full and satisfied.  \n\nWhen I don't know what to get for lunch and I'm on the strip, this is where I go!"
1,"This is about as good as it gets in Vegas.  It's definitely more upscale for a BBQ joint.  The BBQ here is really good but a little pricey.  The good thing is the portions are ENORMOUS.  \n\nWe shared a 3 meat combo (St Louis Ribs, Chicken, and swapped Tri-Tip for Brisket).  It came with 2 sides for 27.99.  \n\nEverything was great.  The chicken was so moist, brisket not dry, and the ribs were very tasty.  We really enjoyed the biscuits with apple butter - be sure to ask for more.\n\nI am a BBQ snob so if anyone knows of a better place (not named Buzz), please message me.  \n\nTill then i'll keep coming back here :8"
0,"This place is awful! Beware...they lie, cheat, and steal! Do not support businesses like this when there are other honest apartments close to ASU..."
0,"I don't get it.  At all.\n\n\nI was here last fall.  We were just wandering around intoxicated and in jeans and sneakers - and walked by The Bank.  After some chit chatting with the bouncer - we were let in, despite our dress, not paying a cover and the fact that we didn't have any girls in our group.\n\nEvidently we were there on a slow night?\n\nWhen we got in - we were immediately impresesd by the wall full of Cristal.  Wooooooooo. Vegas, baby.\n\nAs we made our way towards the bar - we were stopped by the world's most aggressive yet ugliest whores.  Maybe an ugly working girl has to be aggressive - but it was really weird - and actually made us sort of uncomfortable.  Way to go doorman - you let in ugly, poorly-behaved whores - and jeans and sneaker wearing idiots like ourselves.\n\nWe did see Mike Tyson inside - in the midst of a feeding frenzy involving a cougar - which was pretty sweet.  That part was worth every penny of the zero dollar cover charge we paid.\n\nOtherwise - this place is exactly what you'd think it is.  Overpriced drinks.  Music.  Some pretty people.  A lot of people who think they're AWESOME for partying at The Bank.  I wouldn't be outraged about going back - but I am dumbfounded that people actually pay a huge cover charge to enter this place?"
0,"I wish I had read the poor reviews on Yelp before getting my car washed here. First, the positives:\n\n1 Star - Price was reasonable. $18.99 for the Works and $3 off with student ID! I didn't have any problem with employees pushing for upsells. The cashier explained their $60 for $120 worth of basic washes as a Black Friday special. I politely declined and she was very pleasant throughout the transaction.\n\n1 Star - The waiting area is nice, equipped with TVs playing sporting events.\n\nMinus 1 Star - As nice as the waiting area is, I didn't want to sit there for a half hour without anyone telling me my car was ready. A man would periodically come in and call people by name or their car model so I assumed they would do the same for me. I was wrong. Apparently, they were only calling people who were getting detail work done. Finally I got up and looked out the window and saw my car parked way on the other side of the lot. I went up to the cashier and asked her if they were going to tell people when their car was ready because I had just been sitting there for 30+ minutes. She turned to an employee who had come in to cash in her tips and told her they should be calling out the cars. I didn't wait for the cashier to respond to me and walked out.\n\nMinus 1 Star - Exterior: There was grease on one of my hubcaps and near the wheel well! What the heck! I'm going to have to get a towel and clean where they screwed up. \n\nMinus 1 Star - Interior: As soon as I got into my car it smelled horrible. They clearly did not put any air freshener that was supposed to come with my wash in there because it smelled very strongly of an unpleasant soap or detergent. Yuck. Also, my biggest pet peeve about car washes, they did a poor job of cleaning the center console/cup holder area. Still sticky with soda residue. \n\nOverall, I would not recommend and I will not be back. My search for a decent carwash continues..."
0,Cheesy. Room was nice but avoid the buffet. Avoid doing special events here. Staff sre rude and non supportive. We had a wedding for 150 people. We adked for water for the tables and weresnapped at and td tbey woykd get sround to it when ybey could. It was hot outside and people had driven/traveled from long distances.
0,"I've heard good things about Rachel's Kitchen, but honestly I was underwhelmed. The BBQ chicken wrap was bland and a little dry. I almost always clean my plate but it wasn't worth it to finish the whole thing. The sweet potato fries were decent, though. The grilled vegetable and chicken salad was drowning in dressing, rendering it almost inedible. The pancakes -- advertised as being light and fluffy -- needed to be lighter and fluffier.\n\nOn a Saturday morning and afternoon it can be tough to get a table as much of Summerlin descends upon this place. We lucked out and got a table right after we ordered. Too bad the food wasn't worth it. I may go back to give them another shot because other items on the menu sound good. I just hope I won't be disappointed again."
0,"Went to the Body Worlds exhibit yesterday at 10am. It was interesting but I was a little disappointed. I think the first run of this might have been more relevant to my interests. This time, it focused mainly on parts of people rather than whole bodies. Also, it says it focuses on the brain in the ads but there was only a small case of brain-related things. \nAs far as the rest of the Center goes, I think that if you don't have kids and/or are over the age of 10, nothing here will interest you. It seemed to all be for ignoramus or children. I was bored."
0,"Some people have said that this place doesn't need another bad review? I'm giving them one because they more than deserve it.\n \nI went into their shop in Nov to look at Da Vinci dresses & find about prices for a couple styles. It took them a month to get back to me & that was after I called every week. They kept saying \""Well so and so is handling it and they're not here.\"" I finally just went somewhere else before getting any prices.\n \nI ended up at I do I do in Phoenix who were more than helpful. The dresses were ordered after all my girls paid their deposits in April 2011. Unfortunately, the owner went bankrupt in July & the shop closed w/ no notice.\n \nMy Maid of honor called Da Vinci directly to see how we could go about getting their dresses. They informed us they'd have to send them to another shop. They called her back & said \""Were sending them to Once in a life tyme in Tempe,. I personally talked to the manager about it so when you guys call or go in, they'll know what you're talking about.\"" That was in July. My wedding is in Sept .\n \nAs of 2 weeks before the wedding 2 of my girls had not gotten their dresses. One had come it 2 1/2 weeks prior & had to be shipped to Washington DC. They insisted that they send it rather than me. When she finally got it (16 DAYS before my wedding) she sent me a picture of the label. It had been written on paper that had black squiggles all over it, her name was spelled wrong, & they sent it to \""Washing DC\"". The other dress was ordered by I do I do after the 1st 2 so Da Vinci said it would come in a week later. Every time I or my girls called it was either busy or would ring and ring. We left countless messages w/ sales girls for the manager to get back to us. The ONLY answer we ever got was \""Uh we dont know where it is, try back next week.\"" Finally, I went in. The shop was empty, I rang the bell. Mona came up The minute she heard my name, started apologizing profusely. She showed me the tracking label for the DC dress, & went back to get the tracking label for the other. While she was gone, I noted the utter disarray of the entire place. As well as the phone...sitting off the hook. I have a picture of it. When she finally came back she said the mgr would be up to see me. She then tried to make VERY uncomfortable small talk in which I told her about the conversation I'd had w/ Cherish the week before in which she informed me that I should \""Just wait, since were doing you a favor and all. Its not like you bought the dresses here.\"" Mona informed me that she was Cherish's mother & she raised her better than that. She noticed me eying the phone & the minute she placed it back on the receiver, it started ringing. She answered, It was my maid from DC inquiring again about her dress. Mona pointed at me while saying \""I just showed her the tracking slip it should be there tomorrow.\"" When she hung up, it rang again. After that call she again placed it off the hook. When the mgr asked what the 1st call was about Mona replied \""Oh it was about the birdcage veil girl. Not her.\"" pointing at me. I could hear my maid on the other end, the volume was so high, she also texted me that she was on w/ them. The mgr assured me that the DC dress would be delivered the next day as well as the other dress, she showed me the tracking slip. They said they'd call my maid the next morning to inform her that the dress would be in between 3-4 that day. They never did. She called them and finally when they actually answered they said it should be after 5. 5:22- still not here, the manager is going to UPS to get it. 6:16- shes not answering her cell phone, we don't know where she is, but she should have it. Meanwhile, my maid was told that her dress was in the mgrs (Rebecca) car.\n\nToday I went in w/ my maid at 4:30. The doors were locked & there was another bridesmaid who had driven in from CA (for the second time) because she was assured her dress was in. When Rebecca finally got there & opened them she yelled at us & left again to \""go chase down the UPS truck\"". A half hour later we *finally* had the dress. Rebecca listened to our complaints and was very apologetic (too little too late IMO).\n\n \nI'm absolutely outraged that it took 2 1/2 months to get these dresses. The girls at this shop should have been on top of things calling them & getting them here in an appropriate amount of time. They have NEVER busy when any of my girls or I have been there, we were the only customers in the shop. My girls have less than 2 weeks to get alterations. The ONLY reason we went here is because the designer sent us here. As far as the \""favor\"" Cherish was talking about is concerned, a \""favor\"" would've been giving us a discount on the dresses like every other shop in town was offering to do for I do I do customers.\n \nI'm writing a review of them here as well as any other website that will take reviews. Ive also drafted a letter for the BBB, the owner (who's email address I was given by Rebecca), and the designer."
1,"Okay, my boyfriend and I are big breakfast fans. This is our favorite casual breakfast place. I've probably eaten here about 40 times and I have never been let down. I have tried many things but my two favorites are the Country Benny..its Eggs Benedict with a biscuit and sausage and gravy on top. I'm sure its about 5,000 calories but well worth it especially when you are hung over. My other favorite is the El Vaquero...its a chorizo omelette with salsa and cheese on top. Amazing! I know they are owned by the same people, but this one is far better than the one on Rainbow."
0,"Definitely Not the best place for completely overpriced crepes but it served me well when i needed one after a particularly heavy nite of drinking. It was pretty much the only restaurant opened that wasn't creepy or gross on Crescent\n\nI like the savory (beef, mushroom, cheese) crepe better than the other 2 we had (strawberry ricotta and banana nutella)\n\nThe crepe itself is very mediocre. I'm not sure they know how to make a crepe...it was just a thin doughy thing that held the rest of the stuffing inside."
0,"My party ordered poutine and smoked meat, and it was very tasty. It's not as amazing as I was expecting genuine Montreal poutine to be, but it was enjoyable nonetheless. One minor complaint is that my entree didn't come with the advertised pickle, but I managed to survive.\n\nThe much larger problem I had with this restaurant is that the waiter gave a guilt-trip sob story about tips at the end of the meal. My bill was for $37, and I gave the waiter $40, expecting change. He started to tell me about how if they don't receive a large enough tip, they get taxed on it or some silly bullshit. I proceeded to tell him that I had intended to leave the actual tip on the table, which is what I always do, and I think that's fairly standard. He then said the exact same thing to our table mates.\n\nBegging for tips, regardless of how much customers decide to tip, is NEVER okay. This needs to stop. It made my party and I extremely uncomfortable. It appears that I'm not the only reviewer who had an experience like this.\n\nOn a final note, service was a little slow. We witnessed one table leave before being served after they'd waited long enough.\n\nUpdate: I complained about our waiter after our trip, but never received a response. That sort of behaviour cannot be excused. Don't eat here."
0,"I stayed here for one night because my usual hotel chain in this particular city was not pet friendly. I should have kept driving. Despite their insistence that they are \""Inn of the Year\"" for 2011, this was the most uncomfortable hotel I think I've ever stayed at. The bed was more like sleeping on a rock. The air conditioner did not work well and the room stayed quite hot all evening. Even after driving for over 12 hours, I could not fall asleep in that dreadful bed. It made the next day of driving nearly unbearable. Kudos for being pet friendly, but the rooms need a serious upgrade."
0,"I was expecting a cute cozy cafe with fresh gluten free yummies, but that is not what this is.  It's just a bunch of  frozen baked goods.  I bought the bagels and almost fell over when my total for 4 bagels was over $8.  Hoping that they would be amazing, I tried them today and they were terrible.  Too squishy and salty."
1,"It was almost three years since I had last been to Biaggio's, but I found both the food, atmosphere, and Mr. Biaggio himself to be as engaging as ever.  My dinner began with a rather large Small Side Salad with suitably tangy Italian Dressing that featured Iceberg Lettuce, fresh tomato wedges, Black Olives, and squares of Mozzarella Cheese.  It was a refreshing way to start the meal.\n\nNext up were warm and doughy Garlic Knots with a buttery sheen.  The knots were also large in circumference, and simply excellent in taste.   \n\nA large New York style 16-inch Sausage, Mushroom, & Sliced Tomato Pizza sported mild sausage, fresh circular slices of all-red tomato, and good-sized cuts of fresh mushrooms, and included a nice balance of sauce and cheese, as well as Parmesan splinters sprinkled on top of the Mozzarella Cheese.  The crust was perfectly cooked where it was just beginning to char.  And, this pizza reheated very well in a home oven for lunch the next day, which is a sign of a superior pizza.\n\nDiane enjoyed a large Ham & Cheese Pizza with extra cheese, and our other dining companions split a Cheese Pizza.  \n\nSpongy Zeppoles with White Frosting and Raspberry Sauce rounded out a very fine meal.  I will no longer wait anywhere close to three years before I next return here."
0,Pretty hotel..but NO COFFEE MAKER!! Paid $15 for them to bring coffe to my room and it was only enough for 2 cups!! And the fridge only has room for their stuff that they want you to buy! And a small freezer area. Not that serious! Thanks but no thanks Cosmo! You can do better!
0,"By far, the most corrupt company I have ever dealt with!  I had to cancel service because I had 5 false alarms in a 6 month period, the police department ended up called out 2 of the times which ultimately cost me $$, and then when I cancelled service AND paid a termination fee, they continued to charge my credit card!!!!  Absolutely illeagal!!!!!  Their service is awful and I would rather get robbed than deal with this company.  Do yourself a favor and NEVER do business with ADT/Safe Streets USA."
1,"When you speak about italian food you think lasagna,spaghetti , pizza...but italian is more different and interesting who only this. The owner in this restaurant show our good face of italian creative restaurant.  Clean and polite ambient  . The food is good chance to take a taste from some things simply different, interesting and very homemade italian food! Fresh homemade pasta, fresh fish and meat .! Thank you , Giuseppe."

Maybe once in a blue moon. :/"
0,"This place upset me. I read in past reviews that they ran out of cupcakes, but I didn't think it was a consistent thing. I bought a Groupon to get mini cupcakes for my boyfriends birthday this past weekend - showed up early to grab them before the party and they had a sign saying they were out of cupcakes. Are you kidding?? If the cupcakes are that popular, wouldn't you rather have an overabundance of cupcakes rather than always running out?? I feel like it would be less costly to toss out some cupcakes, or give them away to the last customer in your building than to not bake enough and losing customers. Come on Gigi... Bad business move!"
0,"Had a disappointing time there last night which topped off a few other slightly off visits over the past few months. Decor and layout are fairly pleasant - drinks are drinks and it was warmish and fairly lively. However at 9pm on a Saturday night when most people were chilling out and relaxing - enjoying perhaps the quiet atmosphere..... the DJ started.. and got louder and louder. \n\nIt was so loud it was difficult to talk. The massive TV was showing unrelated music videos.  It was fairly bizarre. And I really was not enjoying it. \n\nAnyway we left, I doubt I'd be back. Nothing particularly wrong but also not particularly enjoyable."
1,"BEST greek place in town.\n\nIt's comfort food. Homely welcome from owners and long time servers. Greek posters and magazines sprawled all over the shop, and you feel like you're in GREECE.\n\nFood? awesome. I can't say anything i don't like in Plaka. Meats, done to perfection, flavorful and juicy tender good. They manage to get me, a no-lamb gal, to eat lamb/beef gyros EVERY SINGLE TIME I'm there. What more can I say?\n\nChicken kabobs, lamb/beef gyros, pita, grilled cheese (omg it's a secret dish??)\n\nDrinks. goddess nectar for the sweet lover, best sweet cocktail I've had. It deceivingly tastes like juice. \n\nCome if you're in the mood for comfort food. yummm"
1,"I loved this hotel, and can't wait to come back! We were in a one bedroom suite on the 41st floor. The room was beyond nice, and the master bathroom could fit an army in it. It's a quick 4 min walk to the strip, or you can cut through the mall (if it's really hot out). I had plans to go to the pool, but we were out and about at the casinos. Yes this hotel does not have a casino, but it makes up for it! Can't wait to go back!! The staff was great!"

0,"My friend and I first came here in August before seeing The Strokes at The Chealsea and we loved our meal so much we decided to come back this week before going to see Imagine Dragons at The Joint over at the Hard Rock. During our first visit I ordered the Turkey sliders and an Oreo shake so of course it was delicious, can't go wrong with a classic meal. However during this visit, I was highly disappointed in the price we paid for our meal. For this round I ordered the Turkey burger because I hadn't eaten at all that day and more for the fact I wanted to try something different, I also ordered the Pecan Cheesecake shake off the menu to try something new. When the shake came, sure it tasted delicious for the first minute but then I realized it wasn't a shake, just a bunch of milk as the taste of pecan and cheesecake disappeared by each sip and more and more milk & whip cream came to taste even after dumping it in the silver cup of seconds. I had wished I got the oreo shake but it was too late. While waiting for our burgers I decided to start munching on the complimentary seasoned popcorn which was so delicious that when they messed up and put the goat chedder cheese on my burger instead of the regular cheedar cheese, I filled myself up with popcorn, that \""milkshake\"" and water so by the time my fresh better tasting burger came out, I was full and didn't even want it anymore. Maybe this review will get 4 or 5 starts on my third visit however right now I can only give 1 star to the waitress who provided excellent customer service and 1 star to the free popcorn. At least I know next time just to stick with the same old turkey SLIDERS and oreo shake....hopefully they still taste good."
0,"My first and only trip to Culinary Dropout was one that I never would like to relive again.  We went on a Saturday night and sat outside to enjoy the weather.  After we were done eating what I would consider to be average food, we were actually brought the check (without asking if we wanted anything else) and expected to pay right then.  We informed our server that we were not finished and were told that if we were going to stay we had to move to another table because they had already given our table away.  Once we moved, and had a few more drinks, we were brought the bill two more times and then told we needed to pay.  Asking to see the manager did absolutely no good.  We were not rowdy, rude, or mean however we were treated as if we were sub par patrons.  With a $300 tab for the food and drinks for the table I am shocked that our service was absolutely terrible.  I would not recommend going to this restaurant at all; that is assuming it will be around that much longer."
1,"Love this place!  Been there twice.  Keep an eye out for the swordfish, if they have it, order it!  They have an amazing wine selection.  If you can't find what your looking for there, you simply don't know what you want.\n\nStaff is excellent.\n\nPrice are high BUT well worth it\n.85709"

0,"I am going to agree with Texas Rose and Jack M.  This place is good for tourists but not locals.\n\nHad I known what I know now, I would never have done business with them to begin with. \n\nThey give \""Arrogance\"" a bad name. \n\nI had never shot a hand gun, and my friend who is quite good took me there. I found them to be as friendly as a Motor Cycle Cop writing someone a ticket for going 2 miles over the speed limit. \n\nI shot a gun I  liked, then they told me they didn't sell it, and I had to buy another model. I later found the hand gun I liked, and bought it somewhere else, for less. \n\nAll they wanted to do is sell me things that I didn't need, and at a much higher price than anyone else in town.\n\nI took my CCW Class there and I did find the instructor to be a good guy. However, during the class one of the store employees came in, and cleaned guns, leaving that nasty solvent smell with 21 others in the room. \n\nYou are better off finding what you want, going to a place like Bass Pro, where you can test fire it, then finding a great price on line with Cheaper Than Dirt, and picking it up at Big 5. You will save considerable money.\n\nAs far as a range goes; It is small and very loud. If you are a local you can go to the Clark County Range at the end of Decatur, for $9, shoot as much as you want. You can also buy ammo there for about the same price as Walmart. They have rules, but it's a much more pleasant experience.\n\nIf you're from New York, California, New Jersey or Hawaii, where you don't get many chances to shoot, than go here. You're on vacation, you won't mind blowing the money, and since you're not serious, you'll never know you are being taken."

0,I had come here once before when they first opened and they were absolutely delicious!\nI was in the area and had some extra time today and they no longer exist. :-(
1,"In for a quick bite I found myself starting off with the pretzel bite appetizers and the plain jane burger. The burger came out cooked to perfection with good ingredients, some people would think because a burger doesn't have cheese its plain, this was far from it. The service was good and management came to followup.\n\nNote: This place does not take Red Rock gift cards, they are independently owned."
0,"Quick review: Closer to 2.25 stars.  Tried the Friday night fish fry at Quivey's and wasn't terribly impressed.  Baked fish and perch were ok; deep fried cod was soggy, as were fries.  Service in the Stable Grill was quite lacking.  Averaged $20 per person with 1 drink.\n\n\nDetailed review:\nA few coworkers had been raving for months to us about Quivey's Grove - they insisted it was the \""best fish fry you'll ever have.\""  So, we rounded up the crew and hit Quivey's, hoping to score a stellar fish fry.\n\nWe placed our name for a table in the Stable Grill and were told the wait would be about 45 minutes to an hour, and that was with us arriving almost immediately at 5:00pm.  I can't imagine how long the wait would be later on at night!\n\nThe Stable Grill has a ton of character - it scores bonus points for the huge timber-frames and the awesome wooden bar.  Beer selections, while not countless, were really nicely represented - from Ale Asylum to Tyranena - nearly every one was a specialty Wisco microbrew.  Beers were $4 for a pint.\n\nWhile waiting, we ordered the cheese curds, which were served with a mustard side (interesting combo).  They were decent curds, but probably not worth $7.  As they sat, they became greasier - usually a sign of a fryer that's not up to a hot enough temperature.\n\nWe were led to our table at around 6:15, and were presented with menus.  As mentioned by others, the traditional menu at the Stable is geared toward sandwiches, many of which looked and sounded interesting, but we were here for the fish.\n\nFish options include: baked cod, deep fried cod, or deep fried lake perch.  Potato options are limited to parmesan potatoes or fries.  All come with coleslaw and a really nice bread - the bread was dense and flavorful, soft and chewy, with just a hint of crustiness.  You can order the deep fried cod with an all you can eat option for an extra $1.50.  \n\nI opted for the sampler, which got me a serving of each type of fish, and I chose fries as my side, because everyone else at the table went with the cheesy potatoes.  \n\nPlates arrived after a 20-30 minute wait.  The baked cod was mediocre - slightly watery, very mild in flavor, featured a firm and meaty texture, but wasn't terribly flaky.  My guess is that it had been sitting in a steam warmer for a while - it didn't taste \""fresh from the oven.\""\n\nThe deep fried lake perch was good.  Firm texture, good fish flavor, and featured a nice crumbly breading that stayed fairly crisp throughout the entire meal.  If I were to come back to Quivey's, I'd go with the perch.\n\nThe deep fried cod was a major let-down.  It was actually soggy when it arrived; the beer batter wasn't crisp, but instead spongey.  The fish itself was flavorless and extremely watery as well.  This fish had clearly been sitting for a long time before it was plated... argh.\n\nThe fries were as limp as any bad drive-thru fry I've ever had.  I ate about four of them and left the rest to sit.  I'm told the cheesy potatoes were ok, but some people's were cold as well.\n\nAfter polling the five members of my group, the general feeling was that Quivey's failed to deliver.  The fish was slightly below average, many items were cold, and everyone's deep fried cod was soggy and unappealing.  Service was slow and sparse as well.\n\nQuivey's Grove = FAIL\n\nFood = 2 stars\nService = 2 stars\nValue = 1.5 stars ($17 sampler plate; $14 for baked fish?)\nMISC = 3.5 stars (nice atmosphere, decent bar area)\n\nPerhaps we had a mediocre experience because it's lenten season and they were slammed?  I'd be hard-pressed to try the fish again, but I'd consider sampling some of the other food options.  Sorry Quivey - you've got a cool pad, but that's about all you've got going for you."
0,"Undercover police officers hang out in the store and harass you regarding the validity of your driver's license (and this happens AFTER you have your id scanned by the clerk). I had an experience the other night that took up 25 minutes of my time, which is absolutely unacceptable. In addition to this, the prices are ridiculously high. They charged $55 dollars for a handle of Jameson which can be purchased at costco for $38 dollars. My advice? Stay as far away from this place as humanly possible. \n\nSigned,\n\nAn irritated customer that is of age to purchase and consume alcoholic beverages"
1,"I've noticed a lot of negative reviews of this property, but I'm not sure exactly where they really are coming from. I've stayed at this property since going to Las Vegas has become sort of a \""hobby\"" for my girlfriend and I. Anyways, some quick tips and then to a comprehensive review.\n\nQUICK TIPS! QUICK TIPS! QUICK TIPS!\n\n1. Parking is plentiful. After Harmon Way, there is an inlet for Crystals, Mandarin Oriental, and for Aria! \n\n2. Instead of parking on the second floor of the parking structure, try parking on the THIRD FLOOR! That gives you direct access to the walkway to the casino and saves you an elevator trip.\n\n3. The 20 dollar tip trick has held true for me here. If you don't know what it is, it's a check-in trick that allows you to get a \""complementary\"" upgrade from whoever checks you in.\n\n4. If you're going to Vegas for a specific reason--Bachelorette party, first time in Vegas, wedding anniversary, relationship anniversary, etc.--mention this when booking in the comment section and mention it again when you're checking in. It pays to be excited! They might be able to comp you some shows or send you up a dessert platter on the house.\n\n5. If you're looking for a quick bite, Jean Phillipe is just downstairs to the right of the elevators. No fancy chocolate fountain, but a smaller wait and less tourists taking photos.\n\n6. There is a tram that has three stops: 1. Monte Carlo/Parking lot of the Aria, which is really the entrance to the casino on the third floor of the parking structure; 2. Crystals for shopping, also has the best direct entrance to the check-in area, 3. Bellagio/Vdara, both are accessible from that location\n\n7. Turn down service! Request this and you get some awesome chocolates and nice comfy slippers. Pretty standard at most hotels, but at Aria it feels like a treat. Really romantic for couples. :)\n\n\nNow the real deal, the big review.\n\nI love the Aria. I won't ever cheat on the Aria as long as they can still serve up the fantastic room deals that they usually have. We just got back yesterday from our trip and we were able to book at $95 a night with $100 Food and Beverage credit. Look for the deals and avoid the upsell. You can easily tip the person checking you in a $20 to secure a higher floor with view or even if you go all out a panoramic corner suite. This is what me and my girlfriend was able to get to! We had an awesome person check us in early in the afternoon who hooked us up majorly.\n\nAnyways, this hotel is my favorite place to stay because of the service, the decor, the rooms, and the gaming area. In terms of service, it's a big deal for me to see people actually greet you in the morning with a genuine smile. I know that it's difficult to work in the service industry, but I've never had a really bad complaint about the service. Sure, sometimes the shampoo is a little low or a robe never makes it back from the laundry. However, whenever we complained about any housekeeping detail, the staff has been incredibly apologetic and willing to bend over backwards to make it right for us.\n\nNext, I want to say that the rooms are lavish and the bed is fantastic. To be honest, the bed feels like sleeping on a cloud with all that padding. Sometimes though I find the bed to be too soft (First World Problems, I know!) and I end up aching a bit. But, the rooms have been designed with some comfort in mind. I love the shower/tub design that most resort rooms are fitted with. I'm not so much a fan of how the corner suites are set up, but that's another issue because they are still incredibly comfortable.\n\nFor me, another thing that makes the Aria stand out is how awesome the decor is. It feels very modern, clean, and very comfortable. The subtle and unmistakeable vanilla smell radiates throughout the casino floor. It made me want to get an ice cream! The other thing that I've noticed is that the smell of smoke is really well contained in the Aria. This also brings me to the next point about the gaming area, I've never had any problems with the dealers or finding a cocktail waitress. In fact, most of the time I've had them come within five or so minutes of me sitting down or have had them come by multiple times. Even during the down times in mid day or late morning, there was nothing that caused me to believe that we wouldn't get good service. Furthermore, the tables and chairs are all comfortable and the slot chairs are well padded!\n\nI've had nothing but very positive experiences with the Aria, and I can't wait to get back there again sometime in the future!"
1,Just drving by and saw this place had just opened.. thank you!  Great place...had the hero and it was great! Glad to see new restaurants coming in to the qc...  This place will make you wonder why you ever ate at subway...incredible meat potions on my sammy..
1,"Favorite sports team of all time! Growing up I liked sports...loved boys playing sports and after trying my hand at cheerleading decided I didn't fit in with the conformation of cheering in a group. I was the bane of the squad because I actually watched the game and jumped up out of turn to go crazy and scream during riveting finals tournaments. Yup I \""ruined the cheer!!\""  I was too hyper to be a cheerleader and ended up becoming a stats girl instead. A much better role, for when the game was nail bitingly close I could yell and jump to my hearts content. \n\nThis being said I love watching sports and Hockey was the logical choice, that would make it the ultimate sports viewing experience, in my eyes. I mean hockey guys kick ass, the skills it takes ice skating with that tiny puck, the fighting COME ON! In college and highschool I went to many games and when I moved to Pittsburgh going to the Pens games became one of the best times I would look forward to. \n\nWhen I first moved we weren't doing so hot so the games were affordable, and easily attended. So my love of the Pens did not grow from fair weathered admiration. We have the best team in the league and soon after,  we won the cup!! Love, love, love! It's such a \""livable\"" city that it's possible to run into these athletes all over town! I won't give away where I've seen practically the whole team on many nights surrounded by puck bunnies sooo...get out there!  It's fun to see that SOME of them are respectable young men and behave, unlike many the football player. Sorry Stillers the Pens are number #1!! Lets go Pens!"
1,"Great food, Love the drunken clams! They have awesome daily specials and the best prime rib sandwich ever! But whats even better is that it is consistant. Very friendly and fun staff."
1,I read about their Operation Santa Claus holiday charity campaign via friends on Yelp (thanks Jolly!) and called in to make a donation to help those in need.  I am always impressed when a media outlet gives up their airtime to support a local charity....kudos to the team @ ABC 15 for putting together this event!
0,"One of the best looking cafes in Vegas located in the newest casino on the strip. Unfortunately, for a cafe with a limited menu, it seemed to be overpriced for average food.  \n\nFor the price of the open-faced Philly Cheesesteak sandwich, it wasn't worth it.  Definitely had better elsewhere for much cheaper.\nThe Chillaquilles didn't look or taste like it should.  The texture was soggy and the flavor was dry.  The complimentary bread with cream cheese-tastin butter was better.  \nAt this point, my cousin just couldn't wait to \""walk off the disappointment.\""\nThe BLT, however, was satisfactory with thick slices of smoked applewood bacon, arugula, and tasty basil sauce.\n\nIf it wasn't for the BLT, I would've given a one star rating only for the attractive decor and new vibe of this place."
1,"They have some pretty good food here and great service. I recommend their El Diablo breakfast pita as well as their albacore tuna. Breakfast bagel is also great here, and better priced than Einsteins. There loose leaf teas are also great!"
1,"Local restaurant, really small... Owner is the chef... Really funny and nice guy. Very authentic!"
1,"Pleasantly surprised! Great food and service. My only complaint is the same as other people have said, the wonton soup. The broth is good however, the wonton's are not stuffed with anything so it's basically broth with wonton skins. \nEverything else was great! Highly recommend if you are in the area."
1,"I had no interest in this show, but I am glad I went.  This was one of the funniest shows I have ever seen.  Go see it if you can. But don't take\nsmall kids."
1,"Super cute clothes, super cheap prices!\n\nI absolutely love little boutiques like this with non-boutique prices :)"
1,"Busy place! It was everything you'd expect from an Einstein Bros Bagels. Nothing special. I'll go back, but be prepared to wait in a long line if you go on a weekend morning between 7-11am"
1,Yes it's a bit weird that you have to go through the bigger dog area to get to the smaller dog area but overall it's clean and got a good amount of shade.
0,"I was here twice and both times I felt the food was average at best, and not worth the pricing. \n\nIt's only pizza, sandwiches and salad and the trouble with that limited menu is there are dozens of places with a mile of here that offer better. \n\nI ordered the Shrimp Po Boy on my 2nd visit. 6 average sized shrimp, one leaf of wilted lettuce, and two thin slices of tomatoes for $8.95.  No thanks. For that price I can go to Johnny's Red Bowl and have a huge salad (enough for lunch) plus entree for the same price (including drinks!). \n\nWhen I asked the waitress what the white colored sauce was, being as I don't like heavily peppered sauces - she did not know. Worse, she giggled and was proud of her ignorance of what she was serving \""Why would you want to know?\"" she said,  \""aren't mysteries so much more fun?\"".  No ding-a-ling, mysterious are not fun especially when your stomach can't digest certain foods. \n\nTurns out it was a mustard-seed sauce which I felt didn't go with shrimp anyway. \n\nI find the prices between Blakeney and Ballantyne commons are higher than elsewhere due to the affluence in the area. If you want to pay double than go for it."
1,"I always stay at this hotel but bc it was my birthday weekend, I wanted to get a massage. Read the reviews and figured you can't go wrong w anything in the Westin so I thought I'd give it a try. I got an 80 minute swedish massage given by Cyndi.\nI was given a robe and slippers to put on which all spas don't offer. I noticed a relaxation room, a sauna, and a shower. \nThe experience was great and listening to Cyndi tell me things that I didn't know about Vegas was informative and great. It was nice being able to take a shower before I left the place and the bottle of water was better than being given a cup of water. \nThe staff was sweet and I will definitely come back. It didn't hurt that I get a discount through my job."
0,"Had breakfast here. Truly the worst $8 meal I've ever had. Was not greeted by anyone when I arrived. I flagged a waitress and asked to sit at a particular table, and she said fine, and cleared the dirty dishes from previous diner without wiping the table or providing me with silverware or a napkin. Ordering went fine, however, my eggs over easy took about 25 minutes to arrive......and they were cold. Yes, cold, cooked eggs. The toast was just barely warm enough to almost melt the butter. The potatos were clearly from a bag that had been rewarmed. The bacon, blissfully, was fine. Had to ask for silverware after my cold meal arrived. Waitress got them for me, but I had to go grab my own napkins and jams and jellys from another table. Yipes, what a hideous combination of poor service and crappy food. Would avoid this place for breakfast, that's for sure."
0,"Why a one star review?\n\nMy room smelled like raw sewage.\n\nWe complained to the front desk several times to fix the problem or change our room. They advised us the hotel was fully booked, but they would fix the problem.\n\nTheir fix?\n\nA man came up to my room, plugged his nose unceremoniously at the overpowering smell of assholes and proceeded to spray a can of glade around the room for a solid two minutes. \n\nMy room now smelled like someone was embarrassed they had unloaded a monstrous shit and was trying, unsuccessfully, to cover it up with cheap perfume.\n\nThey did this twice.\n\nFurther, the hotel is outdated, and the casino smells like a wet ashtray. \n\nBrutal place, do what you have to do, pay what you have to pay, to stay away from here. \n\nIt is just not worth it."
0,I had a bad feeling about this place and I should have listened to my gut. If I did I wouldnt be awake at 4am with what I call reverse food poisoning where it comes out....well u know. Sorry for the tmi but I ate here 12 hours earlier and im still paying for it. The only saving grace was that Friday night dinner includes ayce new york steak made to your liking. And I got there right before they switched from lunch to dinner so I only paid 8.99 instead of 13.99. Stay away.
1,"Since my last review, I've been to this place several (maybe 20) more times. They have live music (with no cover) on Thursdays-Sundays, which has proven, without fail, to be very entertaining. \n\nThey also have free wifi so you can bring your laptop and get some work done while you eat. The place is generally very quiet on weekdays during lunch, so it's convenient to sit in a booth and actually get some work done. \n\nReally can't think of a negative thing to say about CKs. Actually chose this as a venue to throw my boyfriend's birthday party on a Saturday night. Can't wait!"
0,"This place needs a health inspection. The walls, the tables, and especially the kitchen need to be inspected. The fish is not fresh n falls on health problems.."
0,"No beef ribs? Forget it, this ain't a Q place.\n\nWhere are the guys chopping hickory? How do they actually smoke anything?\n\n$$$ to high for a hole in the wall prefab Q place.\n\n(Sort of an update) My wife said the above was unfair if I had not even tried the food so she brought me some to make an informed opinion. So here it is:\n\nThe brisket was dry and the smoke taste was I think injected, I could not locate a smoke ring. The ribs were drown in sauce and for good reason, the hog was overcooked, sad. The sides were nothing to cheer about, I have had better beans and slaw from Walmart, and that is truly sad. \n\nThe original single star is exactly the same after eating the food. I may have made some assumptions based on what i saw when I walked in the first time, but I seem to have been right. Still looking for great Q in Vegas. (There is good Q, but still looking for great Q.)"
0,"Is this place still open? Their website has been down all week, and no one is returning my messages. We wanted to sign our child up after hearing such good things."
1,"I wish there was a way I could give this place more stars, IT IS THAT GOOD!!  My Husband & I went there last night for our belated anniversary dinner.  His family is German & I grew up in Germany, so we did have rather high expectations walking in the door. \n\nNothing could have made our dinner any better!  Everything was amazing; we ended up sharing everything we ordered.  The pretzel is a MUST.  The nurenberger  plate came with 3 wurst, sauerkraut, and mashed potatoes.  YUMMMO!!  the jagerschnitzel with homemade spatzle was to die for!  By this point, we are completely stuffed.  However, there was strudel calling our names.  We ordered the cherry strudel.  AMAZING! Seriously amazing.  \n\nCafe Berlin was hands down the absolute best German food we have had outside of Germany."
0,"I live within a few blocks of the South Point and have eaten at their Buffet several times in the last couple of years. It's always been decent, clean and worth the money, although I always eat way too much. That's what a buffet is for, right ?\nToday was a sad example of how bad a buffet can get. \nI broke my own rule by going to a buffet that had no one in line, so I walked right in. That should have told me something. \nAll of the hot items I tried were basically tepid in temperature and looked as if they had been sitting a while. I had a piece of what I thought was key lime pie but wasn't and it was warm, when it should have been cold. \nThe breakfast items were OK; after all, what you can do to breakfast? I had a piece of something called Chicken Florentine which didn't look too bad sitting there but then I sliced into it and a portion of the chicken was pinkish, which is one thing that I can't stand. \nI guess it disappoints me that a place I've been several times was so bad this afternoon. \n There are enough buffets within 5-6 miles of me that this will likely be the last time I go to the South Point to eat, at least at their buffet. \nThe one positive thing is that the service was good...the server kept my drink filled and the plates cleared."
1,"I bought my wedding dress here and I was very impressed with pretty much everything here.  The staff was very kind and helpful and even shared in my excitement of choosing a wedding dress.  It felt like I was with friends.  The store is a decent size with a very wide variety of wedding dresses.  They have dude stuff too.  I was very impressed with the girls who helped me because I didn't have a picture of the dress I wanted with me, but they helped me narrow it down and we found \""The One.\""  They are also very good at finding dresses that may also fit your tastes.  Overall, it was just such a pleasant experience and I would recommend it to anyone.  Oh, they will also steam and press your dress right before the big day so it's all beautiful."
0,"Worst service EVER for large parties. We had a party of 12 in celebration of my father in law's 50th birthday. We ordered our food and it took over a hour and a half for it to come out!!! I'm sorry but that's just terrible. Every time we asked the waiter about our food he said \""Oh, it will be out in a few minutes\"". We watched every table around us eat their food and leave before we even got our food. These parties were anywhere from 6-10 people so I don't understand why it took so long for 12 people. \n\nThe food itself was nothing impressive either. The best part about the dinner was probably the Indian fry bread. Everything else was edible.\n\nWe will definitely never be eating here again."
1,"I can totally see why people are confused when they walk in Flamin' Crawfish. The decor is definitely more Red Lobster/Joe's Crab Shack than Vietnamese...but the menu is all Vietnamese-inspired. This review is actually for the Banh Mi sandwiches available at their in-house MyTea counter (to further add to the confusion.) It's no Le's Sandwiches, but the proximity and lack of off-roading/zombie apocalypse definitely improves things.\n\nOrdered a grilled pork banh mi to-go at lunch time. Waited about 10 minutes, but they had toasted the roll which was a nice touch. Some bites of the pork was a little fatty, but otherwise it was a great sandwich. I liked the addition of thinly sliced cucumber, not something that you find everywhere.\n\nMy husband was hoping for a shrimp po-boy (before I told him that Flamin' Crawfish WASN'T a Cajun restaurant), but after looking at their menu they really should offer one, because one of the appetizers is popcorn shrimp and the roll would be perfect.\n\nWe'll probably be back for sandwiches again, but I think we'll save our crawfish eating for outdoor springtime boils."
1,"OATMEAL COOKIE yogurt! It tastes just like an oatmeal cookie, so delicious!! I hope it's not one of the rotating flavors! They have a variety of other flavor options and a pretty extensive array of toppings. I only found a couple cons: It is a little more pricey than some of the other yogurt places around the area, but I keep a lookout for the 20% off coupon in the mailers. This Yogurtology location always seems to be packed. They move people through pretty quickly, so I didn't get the claustrophobic-like experience I get at Mojo."
0,"This restaurant is horrid.  We went when they were within the first couple of weeks of opening.  They had lunch specials that included a drink, and there were flyers all over advertising it, but when I ordered it they said the drink was no longer included.  What?  The chips are the cheapo corn chips you get for $1 a bag at the grocery store.  The only thing that was good was the salsa bar; otherwise they are not worth going to.  The people behind the counter have no idea what is going on."
1,"Went there with a few friends during happy hour and it was excellent from moment one!! The service as wonderful, so attentive at all the right times and left us to talk and eat for the rest of of the evening!  Because we got there at happy hour, the combinations were discounted 20% and most of the drinks are half off so we were paying around $6 a drink. The food was very delicious and fresh! The meats were high quality meats and very tender. I want to go back already!"
1,"On more than one occassion I have had to park here. It is not a bad price, but now I see they have coupons, and I am going to have to start getting those.\nWe are all into not spending too much $4 lately. \nWell, at least this week, hee hee.\n Anyway,  had cut my time short on my last trip. So I did not think that I would be able to make my check in time for my flight. But, I got there parked ,got to level 3 and thru security with time to spare.\nGreat I know~!\nFast ,quick and easy. I just need to get those coupons and fast."
0,They charged 21 dollars for a pitcher of flat Guinness. The food is not bad but I will not be coming back.
1,"Aerogelic Ballooning has always been one of my favorite ballooning companies in the Phoenix area.  I've previously worked for 2 separate broker companies partnering with Aerogelic Ballooning and our customers consistently gave great reviews and never a complaint for this hot air balloon company.  \n\nI would highly recommend Aerogelic Ballooning to my friends, family, and even my current boss who lives in Glibert.  He may actually be getting an Aerogelic Ballooning Gift Certificate from me this year for Christmas!  \n\nCompared to other hot air balloon companies that operate in the Phoenix area, Aerogelic offers a very personable experience.  With smaller baskets than some of their competition, Aerogelic's balloon rides provide great visibility and tons of fun.  \n\nI had the pleasure of meeting up with Aerogelic's owner in Albuquerque where he invited me to dine with his family and crew over breakfast after a morning flight.  The crew is loyal knowledgeable, and always strive for the best customer experience that can be provided."
0,Yikes. This seemed like a good idea in theory. The end product was tasty - pizza toppings of your choice in a cone. But the kids operating the cash register and making the cones were pretty lax about food handling - from the register to serving the cones to filling the ice in the coke machine - all accomplished without once donning gloves or hand washing. I had a hard time NOT thinking about all of the times they touched my cone. But I are it anyway. Won't return.
0,"Staff was training and a disaster zone.  Food was decent.  Price was actually not too bad given that it is in the middle of a hotel.  To be honest I'd probably go back if I stayed at Planet Hollywood again only due to a lack of other good options in the hotel, but otherwise its one to skip."
1,"Amazing fresh and healthy stuff! The Acai bowl is a perfect breakfast or anything. If you're in a hurry, call in your order. They are getting busy and the wait times does suck but it's worth it"
0,"Our air went out, although it was replaced I was told by maintenance to prop up books or stuff to hold the drapes back from the vent part of the air conditioner. This just looks so ghetto. I shouldn't have to deal with stuff while on vacation. The worse part about it was that I e mailed a complaint and attached pictures of the lovely AC and have not heard back and when I called I was told the e mail was enough and was basically hung up on. And what's with all the dead crickets around the pool? Gross"
1,"Bonfire seemed like a new place. I liked the aroma emanating from the place one night and my boss and I went there for lunch.  I was surprised that we were the only ones in there. Not a good sign. But there is a lot of competition as plenty of good eateries are concentrated in Old Town Scottsdale. The decor is dark and very wooden -- reminded a bit of an hipster version of Stuart Anderson's Black Angus. A couple of TVs played college football games. The music was Country and Western (Yawn).\n\nI ordered a spare ribs appetizer and a caesar salad. The salad was good. The ribs were great. They were fall-off-the-bone tender and had a wonderful sauce that was just perfect. Dollops of bleu cheese on the ribs was a surprisingly good complement to the succulent meat. The portion was entree sized too.  My boss was ecstatic about his dish as well.\n\nAfter the meal, we talked to the manager and asked him why more people weren't here. He said that they do incredible business at night. I also commented that he might want to lose the country music. \n\nI returned for dinner a few weeks later.  I ordered the ribs again, with grilled corn on the cob.  The ribs were again enjoyable, but the recipe seemed a bit different with more chipotle spice added.  The corn was very tender and tasty.\n\nMy very attractive server was also the daughter of the owner.  She told me they have only been in  business for 6 months or so.  It also seemed that they changed the music to a more modern, eclectic vibe."
0,"I'm really appalled at how the management handled a situation here the other night. \n\nThere was a group of people drinking by the pool, husbands, wives, and their toddlers, and a physical fight broke out between two drunk women.  There was punching and screaming and eventually the womens husbands separated them.  Later the woman swung at her husband and then the husband punched her back in her face and knocked her to the ground.\n\nThe night shift manager went out to tell them they had to leave, talked to them, etc and he came into the lobby/dining area that our group was sitting in and we had been watching the whole thing through the window.  We asked him what it was all about and he said that a fight broke out, and he was not going to call the cops because the husbands out there were cops. Which doesn't make any sense. And then he said to us \""but personally I don't mind if two women are fighting\"" in a pretty perverted way.   I was shocked that the hotel manager would make light of domestic violence and also be so creepy about it.\n\nAlso, the complimentary breakfast was a joke.  There were only waffles and cereal. Bleh"
1,I love coming in to place where I walk in they know why I want. Every now and then. The staff has a bad day and it shows. They get everyone in and out with no problems. It's located less than 1 mile off of 215 and just down the street from the hospital. They do have specials you have to watch.
1,"I was in BAD need of a GOOD haircut.  I knew I wanted bangs, some layers, something cute and sexy..is that possible?  Yes it is when you have Kristina cut your hair!  Wow!  She was really great.  She took the time to educate me on what's best for my hair, different bang styles, etc etc.  Also, Kristina wasn't a Chatty Cathy...which I loved.  Sometimes I like to just sit in quiet and be alone with my thoughts.  She allowed me that space while still giving me pertinent information.\n\nThe only thing is that I would have liked to know up front what all the extras would have cost.  Shame on me for not asking though.\n\nI already prebooked another appt with Kristina, that's how happy I am with my cut."
1,"This place quickly earned a spot in my weekly lunchtime rotation. I've had the meat pizza roll and a slice of the Otto Frankfurter pizza and both were tasty. The quality of the pizza is solid and they've got a nice, crispy crust that's not too thick. They do sell slices of all their pizzas (see uploaded photos for prices) and I appreciate having a nearby pizza joint where I can get a slice and a drink for $5 or less. Thanks, Otto! I'll be back soon."
1,"I've really enjoyed every show I've seen here. There isn't a bad 'seat' in the house. With the overall intimate size of the amphitheater, even lawn seats have a great view. My wife and I went an hour early for the latest visit and had a great time at the surrounding bars and restaurants. Will definitely come back to see more shows here."
1,"Absolutely tasty!!! This place is one of the best Indian restaurants I've been to. There mixture of Indian, Tibetan and Nepal is a  refreshing blend. The first time I went there I asked for paneer pakora which wasn't on the menu and the owner went to the kitchen and made me up a plate which tasted amazing. They have lots of beers from India and alot of lassi drinks. Just to prove my taste buds are on the level I recently brought a friend who's wife is from India and she said very tasty and top notch. Well worth it. Nice atmosphere as well."
1,"It's a conglomerate HomeGoodsTJMaxx.\nAll rolled into one!\nSo much to see. I was searching for an area rug and had been to 2 other HomeGoods. This visit scored a winner! $99 for a 5x8 rug? Yes. Nice selection of area rugs and there were a few I would consider buying. Store is clean and checkout was smooth, which is important at any major discount retailer. I'd forgotten how close this location is to the 215, and will plan to stop by more often."
0,Not the best food. We had both American and Vietnam food. The pho is sub par at best (the meat was gross) and the burgers were over cooked. Looks like a great place to have a drink and party but not good to eat. We had a groupon so that was the only reason we went. Listen to the reviews and do not eat the food!!!
1,"Normally, I'm a super picky eater. Everything has to be separate, and not touching each other. (I know, maybe a little OCD, but hey, we all have our issues!) \n\nMy friend picked me up from the airport, and took me STRAIGHT here. Wow! He warned me of the concoction that I would be receiving, and that everything would be mashed together. I started to panic, but hey, I kept an open mind! \n\nFast forward to deliciousness.....WOW! Super great! I had the black angus sandwich, and mmmmmmmmmmmmm I'm still thinking about it! \n\nThe bread was amazing, fries super good, and the black angus, pretty tasty! \n\nThis really is a must stop for any visitor to this fine city!! \n\nPS--CASH ONLY here!"
1,"You may THINK you have seen diamonds but until you've been to this ultra sleek jewelry store . . . you aint seen nothin. I have never seen diamonds sparkle the way theirs do. They make Tiffany diamonds seem \""murky\"". The staff is phenomenal. They are super helpful, polite and no where near overbearing. I was able to try on anything I wanted and the fabulous older gent that was helping me stored the info of the ring I liked, my size and birthday in the computer just in case woobie wanted to get me a real treat. Their black diamond thin bands are the most gorgeousest (new word) around."
0,Not too impressed with this buffet. Price wise it's pretty reasonable but personally I still don't think its worth the money for me. By all means please do not let that stop you from going. I just like more variety and better tasting food. The best thing I found was the prime tube even though there is not a lot of flavor.
1,"I know of the canyon ranch mind body and soul philosophy from my past experiences of living in the berkshires (google it)   I had little fear that their smoothies would be top quality.  I have made this a once a week spot to get a really good smoothy at a slightly steep price.  (worth it in my opinion)  The last thing I want to see going into my smoothie is frozen fruit with that weird sugar/chunks of fruit ice that comes with... Everytime my smoothie is made here, it is from fresh fruit with organic fruit juices and a small slice of TLC... haha.  I definitely approve, and you should find out why!  :)"
1,"Lunch may be crowded and a bit slow as they get organized, but at dinnertime last Saturday, the restaurant was empty.  I've eaten here twice now and think it's a great find.  We had the sushi boat.  There was more than enough for two and all of it was super-fresh and delicious. \nPark right around the corner on the side street.  ."
0,Great looking restaurant.  We couldn't enjoy the atmosphere though since they crammed everyone in the restaurant into one tiny section.  I agree with the comment about the food being a joke.  Service wasn't great either - lots of employees around but few smiles or greetings.  Don't be fooled by the looks of this place if you want to have a nice dinner.
0,"I suppose I'm disappointed because it's more Korean than Hawaiian, though from reading other reviews I should have realized that. I do like Korean food, but in this case, I didn't think it worked out too well. The prices are normal - about $8/plate - and you get a main entree with 4 sides. For the sides, you get to pick from a selection of various Korean side dishes, like kimchi and pickled cucumbers. They also have macaroni salad, which is more of a Hawaiian BBQ side dish. \n\nToday I ordered the Beef BBQ plate and my boyfriend ordered the Chicken Katsu and Meat-Jun plate. I thought the beef was cooked well enough. It wasn't so tough that I couldn't cut through it. But I thought it was a little too salty and dry after a while. The meat-jun was really good. I'm not sure what it is. It seems like it was meat wrapped in egg or something...? The chicken katsu was also all right, but the katsu sauce was too thick and too salty as well. \n\nAbout half way through the meal, I started feeling a little uneasy. I'm not sure what it was - maybe it was the macaroni salad or the kimchi. My boyfriend felt the same way, too. It wasn't too bad that I couldn't finish my food, but I didn't really enjoy it and I don't think I'll be coming back."
0,"Visited here on a Tuesday morning for their breakfast buffet using a 25% off ACG coupon.  There was a fairly long, slow moving line at the cashier stand in order to be seated.\n\nService was AWFUL.  I had already practically finished my first plate before a server came around to bring drinks, and then only after I had asked another server is anyone was assigned to my section.  No excuse for that.  Also had to ask for the one refill I managed to get on my coffee.\n\nThe food was decent, except for a piece of beef of some kind that could not be cut with a knife or chewed.  \n\nMy experience at Flavors buffet at Harrah's the next morning was much better."
1,"I come to Vegas often and was just in town for CES which is one of Vegas's busiest and most pricey times. The resorts on the strip were sky high in price so this time I decided to try something more affordable off the strip: The Lucky Club Casino and Hotel.\nThings to consider about me: I'm female. I'm in my 20s. I was travelling alone. I usually book at nice resorts/casinos on the strip. I only stayed one night at Lucky Club and I did not use their casino. This is a review of my hotel stay only. \n\nNow about the Lucky Club Hotel\nThe Good:\nThe price! I paid an online special of 40-something/nt. \nThe room- It was clean! Sure there are scuff marks and it's an old hotel that's seen a better day, but the bedding and towels were perfectly clean as was the room! \nIt was quiet! Normally when I stay on the strip I wake up to drunk people talking loudly in the hallways. That did not happen at this place. It was fairly noise free!\nThe bathroom was decent too! The shower worked and the hairdryer was pretty powerful! The lighting in there was good too (hey I'm a girl and these things matter when doing hair/makeup).\n\nThe Bad:\nOk, the area isn't amazing, but it didn't seem THAT bad honestly.\nThe people hanging around- Sure I saw some sketchy people, but I see them when I stay on the strip too! It's just on the strip you are surrounded by more people and tourists. Always keep an eye out for your safety no matter where you are!\nThe smell- Yes it does smell like smoke everywhere. Oh well. My room didn't smell too bad! \n\nLook- this place was fine for a night to get some sleep and that's that. I was alone so and wasn't going to loiter around anyway where potential weirdos were. I was safe and sound in my room and got some shut-eye! I then checked out easily the next morning and was out of there no problem. I prefer my usual hotels on the strip BUT this place did the trick for a night and I would probably stay here again if I needed to."
1,"Great place for breakfast and a cup of coffee. The ladies here are amazing and super nice. They bring out my food in a timely manner and the eggs benedict there are to die for. During the Fall/Winter season, they have a specials menu that was delicious. If they still have it I recommend trying the pulled pork sandwich and the butternut squash soup. meals are reasonable priced, and if you go online and subscribe to their newsletter you get a buy one get one entree coupon for your next visit, and you get a free entree on your birthday. This place never disappoints."
1,"Atmosphere was definitely 1930's/40's and food was excellent. The entertainment was a little loud, so it was hard to carry on a dinner conversation.  Friendly staff and food was served quickly.  Reservations is a good idea to guarantee seating."
0,"I enjoy going out to tastings, but I was unimpressed by Sharp Edge. It had gotten great reviews, so I was excited about the selection. But it disappointed me, it was an average selection, and the beers were also average. For the price of tasting it was a tad high, but not astronomical, but for what you are drinking, in my opinion, not worth it. I prefer more of a selection. \n\nThe bartender was nice and seating was easy to get, but I don't know if I'd go back of my own volition."
0,"I don't know what possessed me to eat here.  Maybe I thought if it was good enough for George Dubya, it would be good enough for me.  I expected grease, I expected a lackluster interior, and I expected mediocre food.  I guess it met my expectations.\n\nBecause nothing is too good for my husband's wife, he chose the \""presidential\"" table for us, complete with the \""hasn't been cleaned since 2004 presidential plaque.\""  Chips and salsa arrived promptly.  The chips were thin and crispy, but far too greasy.  The salsa was not the greatest either.\n\nI ordered a chimichanga deciding it was going to be my last fat-laden meal for at least a month, or a week, whichever comes first, because I wanted the crispy tortilla.  Unfortunately, only the very ends of it were crispy.  The rest was drenched in sour cream and some pretty seriously bad gray-green guacamole which made the whole thing soggy.  What a sad waste of the deep-frying process.  Inside was green chile, made with beef, rather than my favored pork.  It wasn't too bad, but from what spilled out, I could see there was far too much grease in it.  Not that I was expecting healthy here, but this was ridiculous.  I almost didn't eat it, but I did.\n\nWould I come back?  It's not at the top of my list, but if I say no, I'll end up there next week.  I did see they have pretty good drink specials, and the place was quite busy, so someone must like it more than I do."
0,"Went in a few nights ago and had a dreadful meal.  Service was incredibly slow, calamari was tough and chewy, and the lasagna had the consistency of mush.  Too bad, I have eaten here 5 times with solid results.  Maybe it was an off night."
0,"I will keep this short and sweet and to the point. 1. Their design is nice and what you may be looking for. 2. When they developed our website - they went over budget by over double what we said we had and fought us on the fact that we should pay up. 3. They never finished the site properly - they only did what they thought was enough to say the site was complete. The site is still not functioning with our forms and lead generation. Ben talks a great game at the \""sales\"" portion and then when it comes to the project management and making sure the the site is complete with customer satisfaction - they fail miserably. I will not recommend anyone and go out of my way to tell anyone my horror story.."
0,"Do you come here often? This old line would definitely work here. Great for families or old marrieds looking to get out of the house and laugh-out-loud for a few hours. This place is a brightly colored, entertainingly, loud, home away from home, covered in unexpected but, laughtasticly humorous saying that creatively remind you of where you are.\n\nI have been here a few times in the past, with friends, unsually during the day (Day drinking, as their shirts say). So, the other Saturday night I decided to head over after some strenuous solo christmas shopping. Looking to relax, refuel, drink, flirt and..... (nevermind, it didn't happen anyways). I parked near the Greenfield side and walked up to what I thought was the main door. But, it was locked! The thought crossed my mind that they may be closed? But, the loud music led me around the corner to the chill-friendly security door check who informed me that they serve food until 2am and wished me a good time. As I made my way inside the place was pretty busy on the patio, with a live DJ, no seats left at the bar, and absolutley no one but staff on the inside, I guess that was their intention.\n\nI found a nice spot (with great viewing) on a corner table in the patio area, far too big for just myself, but who knows, the night was still young... Within seconds, my server was at my table taking my drink order and right back to take my food order (Ugh, I MUST have looked famished! Or he's just that good?) He was back over in a few minutes with my chips and salsa and appologized that the food would be taking longer than normal. I thanked him and told him it was no problem, as I was in no hurry. \n\nAs I waited I finally had a chance to really look around. I have to admit, I was quite surprised to see so many regular farmer, construction types had filled the place with their jealous polential wife types (just the feeling I got). It reminded me of my visits to the NW! I guess I'll have to make an appearance at this place more often! I felt like the best looking thing to happen to this place in awhile and I was totally cas in jeans and sneakers! It was a little surreal! Although the stinky eye lady glances in my general direction were getting a bit annoying (...remember, corner table seat.) I wanted to say: Ladies, PUHLEASE, I am NOT looking at your man! ...I am simply trying to lip read Joe Rogan's mouth for the details of the UFC fight. (the other best looking thing in the place, besides me. Yeah, it was one of THOSE nights) Sheesh! But, they would have never heard me over the DJ beats and the cornhole game happening in the walk way. \n\nJust then, my food arrived. Luckily, I had asked them to make it to go. I had read the handy yelp reviews on this Supergooeycheese chimi thingy and Man! This thing did not dissappoint! I dug right into it! Fully loaded and super flavorful! It has this amazing smelling/ tasting jalapeno cream sauce and ?lbs of cheese I asked the servicer, but I forgot (lost in the deliciousness) he smiled as he explained, knowing exactly what I was experiencing. It actually got better with every overloaded mouth full! Quarterway through I paused just long enough to realize I was already stuffed! But, by that time I was pretty much done with the discomfort of the corner seat with a 'greeat' view.\n\nOverall, a great place to take the fam to get out of the house for a nightlife atmosphere with generous sized portions of food and not have to dirty your own kitchen. Buuut, not the best place to go for a 'meeting' or a friendly conversation with strangers."
0,"This Starbucks is in a strip mall at the bottom of Greentree hill and unfortunately has the unlucky fortune of being a hangout for the most obnoxious group of men who come into the store early in the morning, nurse a cup of coffee all day, take up all the chairs, and gobble up all the free samples of pastry that the baristas offer. It's really a shame too because this Starbucks has a fireplace with a nice fire working during the cold months. In the evening when the old man unemployment club leaves is a great time to visit. If not for the \""I can top that\"" club that come in everyday and tell the same old stories over and over IN SUCH LOUD VOICES, this would be one of my favorite Starbucks in the Burgh."
0,This location stated that they were too busy for deliveries and suggested a try one of their competitors... Really?
1,"Everything is really, really good. My favorite is the sage chicken benedict, but I've also had the tenderoin, home made corned beef hash (so delicious!), chicken and waffles....delicious.  My husband was not impressed with the chicken pot pie but everything else has been really unique and tasty.  We took friends who also raved."
0,Horrible service! \nA few friends and I walked into hooters ready to enjoy some wings and beer after a long day of work. We sat down and waited for some service. After about 10 minutes still no attention to our table. Joking around we raised our hands and asked for some attention to a group of hooter girls just hanging out at the bar and still nothing. After another 15 minutes we decided to walk up and go eat at tilted kilt down the street at city scape where the service was the complete opposite. I will never give that hooters my money and it sucks because I love their wings.
0,"This company constantly harasses us by calling every week. We have told them to stop. 6027491677 is the number they call from. Their way of gaining customers is horrible. I honestly would get service from them when I need it, but now that they have bullied us with phone calls, I want nothing to do with their company."
0,The reason it is so dark is to hide the filth... Yuck!  Not impressed in the least... Staff are slow... Surprised the Lakes would have such a hole in their community.  Greasy spoon.
1,Love the clothes and the sales.
1,Great beer selection. Many on tap and I was offered a free flight of beer to sample some. Many TV's so great for sports watching. I tried the happy hour sliders and they were very good. Not sure how long they have been open and I remember this place under another name. Based on some of the other negative reviews I assume they had some opening difficulties as most new restaurant do.
0,"Trendy look, typical go go boys and lots of people standing and drooling over said go go boys. Music wasn't amazing if I recall, but mostly b/c it was trancy - not my thing. A good place to get a drink and get the night started but I would not have this be a destination bar again. In fact, I woulndn't feel at all upset if I didn't get back here the next time I'm in Vegas. That said, it's connected to 8 1/2 (and there's just the one cover charge), so if you go there (which per my review you might given the right circumstance), you might check this place out just because. Hey, at least you get to see the cool piranhas they have!"
1,"I have been going to most of their auctions for the last 3 or so years (ever since a neighbor told me about them). I have bought a few things over the years and (much to my wife's dismay) , I bought an animatronic fullsize GORILLA in the recent March auction! \nThey mostly auction off Slot Machines, Juke Boxes and advertising signs and lights, but they always seem to have something REALLY OFFBEAT in each auction! Fun stuff! \nWhen I was picking up my Gorilla I saw a life-size Abraham Lincoln coming out for the October auction. I hope I am in town for their next auction.\nMy monkey needs a friend!"
1,"Welcome to Uptown, Dandelion! We went out with a couple friends to try out the newest addition to Uptown.\n\nThe interior is warm and inviting, making it easy to sit down and let the day roll off your back. They have great wall art when you walk in and the bathrooms have a fun, vintage feel. \n\nThey have a large selection of wines and beers...and a delicious caramel ice cream with a shot of Maker's Mark. We ordered the mussels (plump and yummy), mac and cheese, and portobello mushrooms (with a special dipping sauce). Apparently they had a very busy night and were out of half of their menu.\n\nThe service was great! Very attentive, yet not intruding. The crowd created a nice blend of chill and happy. \n\nGreat times, didn't break the bank, and fantastic atmosphere!"
1,"Absolutely amazing place to eat all the fried food in Vegas and with glutton free, there is no way anyone is getting fat or getting that nasty greasy food in you! Especially here, it is healthy and yet delicious to enjoy all your favorite fishy food out there!\n\nThe moment you wait in land for this craving of yummy fishes, it quinces your thirst with mouth watering aroma smell!\n\nGo there and Enjoy!"
0,"Ehh.... Probably wont return.  Friendly workers, beautiful restaurant but... \nThe food was NOT good at all..  \nI dont know where to really start. I guess...\nThe waitress didnt get my order right. \n\nI ordered:\nthe burger with BBQ, Bacon, and onions, with seasoned fries and a side salad with croutons....  The salad came back without croutons, had to hunt the waitress down to get them..  The Fries came back without any seasoning. and the fries tasted just awful!  The Burger wasnt too bad.. Although, I think i would have rather have eaten a Bic Mac lol. \n\nMy BF ordered:\nThe Hobo Skillet with side of pancakes... the skillet had a hair in it..  it was really greasy and not much flavor.. and whatever flavor it did have it wasnt the greatest..\n\nThe best the best items we had  were the pancakes, and the croutons.. \nI probably wont go back again...  :("
0,"I really am disappointed in this place now. I use to come all the time but now its not as good as it was before. Plus, the waiter gave us an extra sushi we didn't order and charged us for it. Out of 5-Service 2, food quality 1, business flow 3, menu 3, and price 2."
1,"if you get dessert, make sure you get the bread pudding. It is delicious, warm, and moist. Be sure to try it. \n\nAppetizers are great but the entrees are okay"
1,"Really enjoy this just-off-the-strip hotel!  We arrived a little later in the evening, so there was a super short wait for check-in.  Ariel was the agent who helped us, and he was great!  He noticed it was my birthday when he was looking at my license, and he put us in the HRH Tower, which is an all-suite wing of the hotel.  Awesome!  Thanks Ariel!\n\nThe room was awesome.  We were on the 3rd floor, which gave us a wonderful view of a roof and the parking garage ;), but who are we to complain?  The room was about 700-sq-ft, and had a separate living and bedroom area.  The beds were SUPER comfy!  The living room had a neat touchscreen music system on the wall, which was built in with all different genres of music that played through a speaker by the TV.  You could also plug in your own device, which was a nice touch.  The bathroom was great!  Double sinks, and a separate bathrub (huge) and shower (huge).  The shower had an awesome rainfall showerhead.\n\nWe did not check out too much of the property, but the separate check-in area for the HRH Tower was a nice touch, and all of the staff we encountered were super friendly and helpful.\n\nThe only downside was the confusion of the light system in the bathroom.  It was SO dark in there the first night, and we could barely see anything.  Obviously we could have called the front desk, but we were too tired.  We also couldn't figure out how to use the rain showerhead either, but the other showerhead was still great.  We did go by the front desk the second day, and the agent let us know that there was a master switch by the front door that controls the light in the bathroom.  Seems a little poorly designed and confusing.  He also sent up engineering to look at the showerhead, and they left us a note explaining how to use it.  Great followup!"
0,Another trendy restaurant with over priced small portion meals.
0,I love FEZ and it is killing me to give them 2 stars.  Why?  The service was just flat out awful!  Our annual Christmas meet up was not a good experience.  The food was still great as always.  We sat for 10 mins before anyone came by.  Then another 10 mins before our drinks made it to the table and we ordered.  Never saw the server again to get a refill until the food arrived.  Then we had to flag another server down for another refill.  They said they will get our server.  Maybe 5 mins or more then the our server showed up.  I am so bummed!!!!
0,cons: all rides spread so far apart... whoever designed this park didn't think carefully about layout (compared to other water parks where the stairs to the slides are close to each other... not spread on opposite sides of the park).\nThe ground is unbearably too hot... must wear shoes to get around... of course this is expected in vegas.\n-there is only one entrance to the lazy river... would have been great to be able to get in and out at two points at least (to save walking from one side of the park to other other in thee heat)\n-life guards are so ANAL and whistle happy.... can't do anything in the lazy river except for practically  float on the spot.\n-can't take food in.\n- RIDICULOUS amounts of bees or wasps everywhere.\npros: \n-water feels great\n-some great slides!
0,"This place has horrible pizza.  I was told by a passerby that they had good pizza here while going to the post office, I'm not sure what this person was thinking.  This is the worst pizza I can remember having, it was overpriced and burnt.  You look at it and know it wouldn't taste good and you aren't wrong.\n\nGo to aiello's, mineo's or order pizza hut lol."
1,The best casino and hotel on Freemont St. The people are down to earth and not stuck up like some places on the strip. I love it! The pool is amazing.
1,New favorite sushi spot ! They had my favorite roll PinkGirl ! The Pad Thai was delicious ... The place is very nice and the prices are great for lunch & dinner ! Unique decor and attentive wait staff .. Two Thumbs way up
0,"The Mr. and Mrs. have eaten at the McC & Schm in Bridgewater, NJ, with family.  The Mr. enjoyed his meal at that locale.  The Mrs. does not remember what she ate, but probably nothing memorable or out of the ordinary.\nRecently when the Mrs. accompanied colleagues to an early lunch at this McC & Schm on South Tryon Street in Charlotte, NC, she was expecting nothing out of the ordinary again.\nThe Mrs. wanted a meal without any fish or meat, but there were no enticing vegetarian offerings.  So she asked the very nice server if she could have the salmon rigatoni ($14) minus the salmon.  The accommodation could be made.  Nice.\nThe bowl of rigatoni contained small pieces of asparagus stalks and mushroom shreds. a tiny bit of artichoke, and a very liquid pesto cream sauce (not very pesto-ey tasting).  No problem.  It was more important to enjoy this lunch with the colleagues.\nThe Mrs. ate only half the bowl of soupy rigatoni, then the nice server boxed up the other half to take back to the office and finish later.\nThe surprise came when the bill arrived.  There was no price reduction for leaving out the salmon from the dish.  It was full price, without the top-billed salmon.  The server informed no accommodation could be made on the price.  The total bill, including tax and very nice tip, came out to $19.\nUpon returning to the office, the Mrs.' very sensitive stomach was unhappy; perhaps it was the cream sauce.  She threw out the uneaten boxed half of this meal.\nThis lunch of half a bowl of meatless/fishless pasta wound up costing $19.  Way too expensive for an adult-focused fast-food chain-restaurant.\nThe service was nice, the food not so much.  It was the service which earned it the rating.\nNOTE:  This meal was not on a work expense account.\nThe Mrs. does not think it is worth going back."
0,"Watch out at this place. To bad you can't give no stars. They don't tell the truth. I needed a realign of my denture. When I called, I specifically asked if the dentist, Dr. Mike, could do that while I waited and how long would it take. I was told that yes he did do it there and it would take about 1 hr. I drove 15 miles across town to get my denture fixed. When I got there, I had to pay $75 up front just to see the dentist. Before doing so, I verified that he would do the realign then and there in about an hour. Guess what? He told me that he takes impressions only and send the denture to the lab to be done. I got up and left and asked the receptionists why did they tell me he did the work himself. They said \""we never said that.\"" They must really be desperate for $75! Wow! What liars! I'd never gone there to begin with if I had known what I was dealing with."
0,"craft steakhouse does not make the cut\n\nUpon entering we were looking forward to a great dining experience. Like all fine dining restaurants, it begins with service and Craftsteak fails miserably. After being seated and looking over the wine list, we decided against ordering wine. The head waiter returned and found out that we would not be ordering wine and the average service went okay to terrible. He took the orders and NEVER returned until the check was dropped off. We were treated disrespectfully because we were not willing to purchase a $100 bottle of wine to increase his tip. The food was quite average as well. The meats were prepared nicely, however, the sides and salads were very below average. The fingerling potatoes and green beans were something that I can do better at home. We have dined at many celebrity chef restaurants in Las Vegas and this one certainly doesn't make the cut!!!"
0,this place is a dump.  half the menu from the website is not actually being served anymore and they are NEVER OPEN during business hours.  having a restaurant is a business not a hobby.  if you're going to sell food then be consistently open otherwise nobody is going to waste their time driving over to be greeted by a locked door and inaccurate hours of operation posted outside.  buncha amateurs running this place into the ground.
1,"I went to Six Penn not knowing or hearing anything about it so I didn't know what to expect. Looking at just the decor, I thought to myself, this has to be one of those classic steak house's with a menu consisting of just 7 cuts of meat and potatoes. Upon looking at the menu though, I was surprised to find classic Americana with a twist. Listing such items as meatloaf with sauerkraut bacon mashed potatoes, popcorn grits, pork chops w/apple cider soy glaze, and lobster or buffalo chicken mac and cheese. All with detailed ingredients that were a little amusing like butternut pesto cous cous, and serrano apple puree, and english peas. I always make fun of menu's like this because it's like... oh... serrano apple puree, and english peas taste much better and is more sophisticated than just apple puree and peas. I know chef's use descriptive phrases like these to liven up the menu but come on. \nThe ambiance and decor is sophisticated and is dressy to casual which pairs well with the upwardly mobile clientele they attract. The dining areas are dimly lit, which is very pleasant and is appointed with dark cherry wood furniture with brass accents. I was here for a private dinner party which occupied the entire upper level so I'm not quite sure if the staff was giving us special attention but the service was impeccable. And they were more than willing to accommodate the requests we had. First they allowed us to use the roof top terrace even though it was closed. The terrace is not very big but was complete with sofas and tables which was perfect for cocktails. While on the terrace it got a little chilly. So we asked if they could turn on the outdoor propane heaters and 3 employees tried unsuccessfully for about 30 min never giving up. And it wasn't until we told them it was not necessary anymore that they stopped. Now that's service!! \nAll in all it was an excellent dining experience. The food was great but I have to say the staff was what made it excellent, and I do recommend it to anyone who is in the area."
0,"read the other yelpers reveiws and decided to try this out.  Must say I disagree.  Walking in, 2 dead roaches in teh entry window...omen.  Place had a cool bahama meets sports bar niche so we went it.   Went in for breakfast.  waiter had no clue about anything on the menu, kept asking US what the menu said.  Ordered a scramble and made sure it had cheddar, not american (asked because it said cheddar but they seem to list american cheese on everything else), it landed with both.  Asked for the potatoes to be crisp, they came blackened/el charro!  The bacon was unrecognizable from the blackened potatoes.  Wife's burrito was almost 100% full of potatoes.  Service was poor at best, a bit sweaty and unkept, but I will say my cranberry-OJ was good.  Avoid if you know what is good for you."
0,"Well I finally tried this place with a friend of mine. I was kinda interested to see how this would go since I saw that it had opened. They let you choose your own soup base, the type of noodle and the \""toppings\"" you want. Well I didn't really know what to pick. I didn't any explanations as to what kind the soup bases were; I had to google them on my phone. And for me, the soup base is the most important part so I know what sort of toppings I wanted. So, I sort of just winged it. While my friend went with one of their soups from the menu.\n\nWell, his soup was served first and upon looking at it, it looked like it was lacking, just things in general and was getting worried about mine, which came out a few moments afterwards. Looking at mine and looking at his, I found mine to be very full - full of noodles, veggies and toppings while his, well as stated, was lacking. Well, I can't say I loved my soup. I found it missing something, maybe if I knew more about their soups bases, I might have been better equipped to make choices. The soup didn't suck, but it wasn't as awesome as I wanted it to be. \n\nI don't know if I'll be back anytime soon, but I'd probably try it again to see if it gets better."
0,This plaza is nice...its pretty small... They almost have everything... One time We bought rice here and there were bugs inside the clear bags of rice..it was really gross.....i told one of the workers there they took care of it.... The big bags. Of rice they sell are sealed pretty good but the clear ones they make well we saw bugs and it was really gross.... Im sure the store got that taken care of...but the service is not that great either i asked for where an item was and this guy said no english and he could of got someone else to help me out.. they have great restaurants in the store and a food court.. no offense some of the food in the food court is overly priced for how much they give you. Other than that this store is okay.
1,"This place is a disneyland to my tastebud. \n\nI was screaming like a little 5 year old for each of the orders that came out--Frozen Hot Chocolate, Foot long Chilli Cheese Hot Dog, followed by a Audrey Sundae. I was a bit disappointed that the Frozen Hot Chocolate didn't really seem to be anything more than a sloppy milkshake made from Nesquick, but the foot long hot dog...oh the foot long hot dog...I was so fricking thrilled by the sight and taste of it. IT'S SOOO DAMMNN GOOODD!! The Audrey sundae could've used a lot more coffee ice cream but it's also yummy as it's served.\n\nI'd definitely give it a 5 stars if they would lower the price down for each dish. Don't get me wrong, I'd go there again in a heartbeat but the willingness to do so might be affected by the amount of money in my account."
0,"Most awful club I've ever been too, stood in a SUPER unorganized line over memorial day weekend for an hour and we had PRE-PURCHASED tickets and they gave us a guest list pass that everyone had and still didn't just get to walk in. Never again this is the worst nightclub ever."
1,"Yummy taquitos!  Great atmosphere, felt like I was in Mexico.  Happy hour is pretty decent.  Would love to come back at night to see how crowded it gets."
0,"PLEASE do something about that slippery floor before somebody sues your ass for injuries!\n\nI've stayed at the Cosmo twice now and the first time I had the convenience of lounging at the Bamboo pool which was quieter and much closer to our room than the Boulevard Pool. We decided to check out the Bamboo pool around noon on Friday and it was closed for whatever reason so we had to resort to hanging out at the Boulevard pool which was all the way at the other end of the casino near the day club.\n\nWhile I was walking pass the bar area to find some lounge chairs I slipped and caught myself near the entrance to the escalators. I was walking barefoot at the time and figured perhaps I was being clumsy. Then when I proceeded to walk back again I completely ate it this time at the same exact spot and crash landed on my elbow and back. I now have a nice bruise on my elbow and pain radiating from my back and ribs because of this horrific fall. Good thing I didn't hit my head otherwise I'd probably end up in the emergency room. I swear the floor is so damn slippery and I can only imagine what would happen if an elderly person or child had fallen. They have absolutely no signs whatsoever near the floor so anyone is bound to slip and fall from the pool water that spills out to this area. The life guard had to come and make sure I was okay, but even after I suggested for them to put up a caution sign I never saw them take action in doing so."
0,"This wasn't the first time I had been here, I was actually here for the Sema party a couple of months ago. It was a lot more chill than that night, but one thing was still the same... They have the worst DJ. At one point I felt sorry for him and the thought of throwing something at him crossed my mind a couple of times during his reign at the turn tables. \n\nI remember coming here when it was called The Light and thought the same about the DJ then as well. A club without a good DJ is like a Club Sandwich without bacon... It's just not a club."
0,"What does it say about a meal for which you, by yourself, have paid $215 (after gratuity) when the most exciting part was the discovery of a new hand-drying technology? While I cannot recommend the actual restaurant, should you accidentally visit B&B Ristorante in Las Vegas, you really MUST try the amazing Veltia hand-drying machine in the bathroom. \n\nTo say I was disappointed with the food is like saying you were disappointed when you walked in on your mom and me trying to conceive your new baby sister (surprise!). Yes, the emotions under discussion are roughly analogous, but they're not really comparable. In my historic review of Lupa I said Mr. Batali was a wizard because that restaurant and Babbo, two of Batali's New York joints, are made not of brick and mortar but of the Platonic ideal of Italian restaurants coalesced into tangible shape and form. Considering how much I love those places I had to find a way to reconcile the crappy impression left on me by B&B. And I did. Here's my theory:\n\nIn 2006 a disgraced, leprous chef approached Mario Batali after spiking the chubby ginger Gandalf's drink and  stabbing him with a heroin syringe. \n\n\""Mr. Batali, I have a business proposition for you,\"" our villain said as the drugs raced through Batali's veins. \n\n\""I'm one with the universe! Time has no meaning!\"" Batali said. Special note for kids: intravenous drugs act with almost instantaneous speed. You're welcome. \n\nSensing an opportunity, the asshole wannabe chef said, \""This is the Lord, Mr. Batali, and I have a business proposition.\""\n\n\""Give unto God what is God's, unto Caesar what is Caesar's! What would you have me do, Lord, on this my road to Damascus!\"" \n\nHeroin. What a drug.\n\nThe antagonist continued, \""I want to make a restaurant with mediocre food, but it's prepared elaborately and attached to an exorbitant fee, so people won't know any better!\""\n\n\""Lord, I made Otto and Lupa and Babbo,\"" Batali said. \""My 'strants kick ass as a rule, I really wouldn't feel comfortable--\""\n\n\""THOU WILT DO AS THY GOD COMMANDS!\"" said the son of a bitch. \n\nAnd so B&B Ristorante was born, the child of blasphemy and lies. I had no way of knowing this when I walked into that den of woe one fateful Sunday night. \n\n\""Lasciate ogne speranza, voi ch'intrate,\"" the waitress said as we took our seats. \n\nThere would be no debate over the menu. I looked my different tasting menu options and ordered the \""regional\"" list with the attached wine pairing in order to have the widest range of savory experiences.\n\nThe first layer of our meal was the Georgia White Shrimp Spiedino. Shrimp arrive on wooden skewers over a mat of veggies. The shrimp was tasty but laden with salt. The texture was ideal, and I liked that the arthropodic flesh had a flavor that subtly changed as it passed over the palate. Still, too salty is too salty.\n\nThe Cavatelli with Rabbit all'Ischitana tasted like store bought pasta with shredded chicken. Boring. Ditto the Maccarona with Ragu Napolitana. Things were getting ominous. Then the entertainment arrived when the Braciole del Portinaio with Eggplant \""Marinara\"" numbed the mouths of two of our party members. Right. Just so you know the reason \""marinara\"" is in quotes is because they make it with lidocaine (not a traditional ingredient in a marinara). At least the mad harlequin calling the shots in the kitchen was consistent: the braciole was way too salty. \n\nI don't remember the Calcagno a Crosta Liscia, so I guess it was made of yawns. The calcagno was followed by a micro serving of Chocolate Salumi with House Canned Apricots. I really liked the apricot bit. I scarfed it down and lamented that it had been served with hard cheese and adorable apple slices. No matter how cute your apple slices are, if any part of my meal resembles something my mom would put in my lunchbox as a six-year-old, you need to return to the kitchen and a.) light yourself on fire, Buddhist monk style b.) apologize to me and c.) revise your menu. Not necessarily in that order. \n\nI want to take time out of my black fuming to mention the wine that was served with the Salumi. The Cascina Ca'Rossa \""Birbet\"" was a delight thing to consume . I think one of my dinner mates said it best: \""If I met a girl and she smelled like this I would marry her.\"" \n\nApparently the B&B staff heard my request for an apology because the next bit, the Honey Semifreddo with Huckleberries was a dessert masterpiece. No word on whether there's a smoldering corpse in the kitchen, but it was a noble attempt at an apology. The Semifreddo had a delicate sweetness that perfectly matched the tartness of the huckleberries adorning it.\n\nN.b. the above passages are not all negative. This meal had high points, and besides the braciole none of my food was bad so much as mediocre. Fuck that noise. When I drop two bills the dead better walk and Amaterasu herself better serve my meal. Between the price and the attachment of Mario Batali's name there is no excuse for the meal I ate at B&B Ristorante."

1,"Love their chai tea. The expansion and additions in recent years have been really nice. I remember several occasions when I couldn't find a seat anywhere. So thankful that's not the case now - thanks for expanding! The noise level is usually low enough for working or studying, and the music selection is good.\n\nMy only complaint is the vibe given off by some of the employees. A few times I have felt almost unwelcome in the coffee shop. I am placing my order and the employee could not care less. The \""too cool for you,\"" hipster standoffish attitude can come across unpleasant. Where is the customer service? Smile more, I promise you everything is awesome!"
1,"I can't believe I waited 11 years to go here. I love nature. I love being outside. \nI'm in love. In fact, my first visit 2 months ago inspired my mom to get us both memberships. \nI loved the tour of the main loop. We learned a lot about some of the plants. I've worked in landscaping and know a lot about desert plants, but we learned a lot of cultural stuff, too. \nI went back for the Chihuly exhibit. It's the coolest thing I have ever seen, and some of the sculptures were so beautiful I cried a little. \nThe staff is a lot of volunteers, so you know they enjoy being there. In fact, I am going to talk to them about volunteering as soon as the holidays are over.\nI can't wait to go again!"
0,"While we were seated immediately, the food service took just shy of an hour. The appetizers were served promptly though, but there was no reason dinner should have taken nearly an hour. All we ordered was two salads and some lentils. We had to leave even before it was served because we had prior plans, and were nearly late. The reason our meal was late was that the kitchen forgot our order and the waitress didn't check on why it took 45 minutes to make two salads. The waitress apologized, but the manager don't even bother to talk with us.  I'm certain we will not go back. The appetizers we had weren't that great either."
1,"Really spacious, kind service, and delicious bread pudding! Great Irish music playing the whole time we were there. Loads of craic!"
1,"My first time here was last night and I was quite impressed! Half of the walls are white half are red (a nod to wine, no doubt) the lighting fixtures were lovely and the decor was cozy! \nTwo friends and I shared a bottle of wine, some chocolate fondue and quite a lot of laughs! Our waitress was friendly and knowledgeable although it seemed as if she was the only one there. \nGreat time great wine great location! Will certainly be returning!"
1,"If you like crafting and sewing this is the place for you!\n\nI needed about 6 yards of upholstery fabric as I am recovering my ratty old dining room chairs, and after some very frustrating searching through tables piled high with folded samples, old bolts and random yards, I nearly gave up then all of a sudden I found *exactly* what I was looking for: three different samples of Toile de Jouy, in pastel pink, green and blue!!  Yes!!   I was super excited to find it in all three colors.  And to add to the awesomeness of my find, my whole purchase, out the door, was only about $12.  Score!!  \n\nBe warned that this places is overflowing with fabric and sewing notions and finding exactly what you want can be a challenge, and their customer service is VERY limited.  But if you come in here with patience and lots of time to spare you will find exactly what you seek, eventually."
1,"I go to vegas about 6 times a year we usually stay on the strip but this time we were taking kids so decided to stay at the Grandview.\n\n(we had been here before for a timeshare presentation, we purchased but quickly realized it was a BIG mistake so we canceled withing our 7 days, got our money back problem solved.)\n\nOk so my experience was anything but pleasant. Room was clean, AC worked perfect, plenty of towels we always found parking right in front of our tower, pool was clean. The kids had a blast at the pool,and next door at the arcade and bowling alley. The only thing is internet was $10 a day we did pay for one day but our room was extremely cheap we paid $55 a night so $10 more didn't kill us. \n\nWhen we checked in we were offered a timeshare presentation in exchange we would get $200 of dining,spa, entertainment credits next door at the Southpoint Casino. We accepted went to the presentation knowing this time around they would not convince us, had a good time talking to the seller he gave us tips on gambling and marriage(we are newlyweds) he didn't push us to buy anything and in 2 hours we were on our way. with the $200 we went to the buffet which was $75 for 5 of us, the kids played 3 hours of bowling and purchased $25 worth of snacks at the snack bar and we still had enough to go to dinner at the steak n' shake.\n\nSo my advice is if you are going to stay here, is best if you have a car so you don't have to depend on the shuttle, go to the strip park at the free flamingo parking there's always parking available and spend the day on the strip. If you go to the timeshare just say NO and if they do convince you remember you have anywhere from 3-7 days to cancel depending on where you live. If you must buy purchase on the resell market as the timeshares go below 50% of retail price."
0,"Saw this place and thought it would be a cool place to kick it.  I ordered two Jameson on the rocks, and gave the bartender I think her name was Dee a $100 dollar bill, she then gave me back $9 dollars! She then proceeded to avoid eye contact with me until I got extremely loud over their very loud music and demanded the rest of my money, which she conveniently knew exactly how much of my money was missing. This definitely put me in a bad mood and I left immediately.  This is a low place when your bartenders are trying to steal your money! hard times I guess!"
1,It's been awhile since I've been here but it's pretty nice inside. I like that it's not on the strip but has enough stuff to do at the hotel.
0,"Gotta love going to a place wanting to have dinner with my extended family, and when we walk in, it's like the record scratched and all eyes shifted on us. The 'best' part was someone at the bar says, \""Hey, this isn't BS (West)\"" referring to the nearby gay bar. Now, granted I would normally go to BS, but I was with family and we wanted to eat dinner. My apologies that my husband and I wanted to eat there with my sister in law and her fianc\u00e9. Also my apologies that we graced this establishment with our presence. Maybe post when your next Klan meeting is so we can be sure to avoid your restaurant entirely."

1,"I came to the Hard Rock Cafe for the first time in my life, totally alone in Vegas, and I hella dig it here.  The crowd around the bar are varied and chill, and the bartenders are insanely nurturing.  I must have been asked \""are you all right, honey?\"" at least 8 times.\n\nThere's a fantasmic-shmastic mixed drink here called the Pickled Tink: raspberry Stoli, pina colada and Grenadine.  I had two.  Also, their french fries can't be beat."
1,"24 HOUR STARBUCKS! Not too far from the Vegas strip. Plenty of seating, plenty of plugs for laptops, etc. They even have plugs under the long couch/bench thing. This place is busy all night, which is probably the reason why its not the cleanest of Starbucks. Easy fix, hire more barista's, or ones that do not think they are too good to come out behind the counter and wipe down a table or two. In their defense, I could not see how the 3 working could find time to clean or stock the display case. Needs at least 4 people on staff at all times. Upper management needs to pay more attention to this location. Right now @ 12:30am, the line is 10 deep. Who knows how many in the drive through.\n\nNice mix of characters walking through. If your looking for an asian girlfriend or boyfriend, this is the place to be.  Kris Kristofferson walked in while I was there. If it was not him, he has a twin. \n\nChris D. - 70 year olds on laptops talking about breast implants is WHY I WANT TO BE HERE. I love quirky, different people."

1,"Dude, you thought Cold Stone had mix-ins? Oh Yeah! has a list, including some of what people may consider crazy mix-ins, reaching over 100. \n\nYou order your ice cream from the bar up front, order your mix-in from a list (which includes Kit Kat, granola, coconut flake, biscotti..... bacon, super green super food, hemp protein... hops, salmon, turkey jerky... soy sauce, habanero... love, magic.... I want to know what Love and Magic are XD), they swirl it for you and their swirling machine, then you exchange money for what they're holding. Don't go too crazy with your mix-ins, they're a dollar a pop on top of the base ice cream price.\n\nThe place was quite packed when we got there, speaking for their popularity... though the guy behind the counter only half-smiled amusedly at us when we (okay, I) stared and then ordered. Did he even say anything?\n\nFor my first visit, I tried the sweet cream ice cream with azuki beans... which was pretty good. The soft serve was partway to a milk shake after the swirl, but still pretty good. I think I'll try me some salmon mix-in the next time I'm back."
1,"I was at Pampas for an event dinner while in Vegas for a conference. This was a great place to hold a dinner for a large group (just over 100). \n\nOur tea was never empty and the food was fantastic. All the staff were efficient and courteous.\n\nIf you're in Vegas, give Pampas a try."
1,"I went to Sababa Grill for the first time yesterday evening. My friend and I picked this place at random so we had no expectations beforehand. Raining as it was, we sat indoors, at the back of the restaurant where a lovely bench with beautiful and colourful cushions were at our disposal. I immediately felt relaxed. The d\u00e9cor amplified the feeling of comfort as though we were provided special protection from the rain.  We ordered our meals with a half a litter of house red wine. Velvety and smooth, we easily went through the bottle. I ordered the merguez plate served with rice and house salad. The merguez was juicy and tasty. The spices brought comfort to my soul as would a hot meal served on a winter's day.  We stayed for a while after finishing our meal, sipping the remainder of the wine, contemplating the scrumptiousness of what we had just ingested, as we carried on with our conversation.\nA great spot for a casual meal with a date, friend, lover, or on one's own. The welcoming and charming atmosphere will take away the woes and worries of the day. An inexpensive treat for those who want to lay back and indulge in delightfulness."

0,"This is the first time I have written a review, and it sucks it's a bad one. I normally dread going to Wal-Mart but they do normally have a lot of the items I need for a decent price. I recently moved so had to go to this one. Anything I need is NEVER in stock, if it is their stuff is SOOO unorganized and don't know where anything is you get what you find then go to checkout and there is the typical Wal-Mart only 1-2 check stands open and broken self checkout machines. I went to stop in not that long ago and the second I walked in I was passing produce and I see not one, but two people working in produce \""stocking\"" grapes. Licking their fingers, no gloves on, stealing grapes out of the bag with their dirty hands (God knows how long they were doing this before hand) then zipping them back up and putting them back on the shelves. I kept secretly spying and saw it continue with different types of produce. I've emailed the store twice tried contacting the manager NOTHING. If I have to go to spend a few bucks somewhere else, so be it. I work at a grocery store so it really gets to me. I know these types of things happen in different types of places but the fact the manager doesn't care REALLY made them lose a customer. I was just going to continue going back, never buy food or produce and tell the manager but nope. My money will be spent elsewhere. There is a guy there who works in produce you can tell he loves his job (well his department) and he does his job well and very professional, then you have those employees who will make you lose business. Disgusting. If I could give this store 0 stars I gladly would. Or a negative 10!! Oh yeah, let's not forget how busy it gets and they do NOTHING about it (most likely from poor managment) and I also called to see if they had a certain product, they said yes and I came didn't find it, I asked and was told they have never carried it. The parking lot is also an accident waiting to happen whether you are driving or walking,"
1,Had a great time with my family at the festival.   All the food was delicious with large portions... but considering how many things you'll want to try I think I would have rather had smaller portions and cheaper prices. Ended up spending a fortune!
1,"Went to Pure in Feb. 2008 with a group of girls. We had an awesome time. The music was great, we met nice people, and just had an awesome time. Sure there were snotty people there, but we go to have fun and not act like bitches so we didn't really care. We also didn't have to pay to get in or wait in line. We flirted with the Pure booth guy and all of us got in free with no waiting. I would never wait 2 hours to get into a club! That's just me. Drinks were pricey and water was ridiculous. TIP: Drink in your hotel room before going to the club so you have a nice buzz and then you only have to buy another drink or two at the club - it saves you a TON of $$$. Or, just meet some nice people with table service willing to share their drinks. That's what we did!\n\nThe same weekend we went to Tao and I would have to say that I actually liked Pure much better."

They had the freshess fish that it tasted so amazing. until one day, lawwwds knows what happen!!!! everything had changed. im talking about the workers, the fish, and the customer service.  we tried the AYCE one day for the first time, and it was not impressive at all. fish was very chewy. there tempura batter was not even cooked all the way, even our favorite roll that we use to get did not taste the same and was disgusted. Not only that, they purposely make the rolls so big that they want you to be stuff from it that you won't order anything else. \n\none word \"" DISLIKE\"""
0,This McDonalds is very disorganized - like it's being run by monkeys. I go through the drive through regularly since it's on my way to work and they consistently get the order wrong or make me park and wait.
1,"Considering it's not unheard of that my boyfriend and I discuss restaurant options and ideas for a given evening, resulting in us almost always ending up at Pita Jungle, it's a bite of fresh air to have discovered Herb 'N Flavors. Great place!  We ordered the artichoke & spinach dip w/veggies to start, which was good, not great. Loved their cucumber water though!  We shared the spicy chicken wrap (awesome!), veggie rice bowl (great flavors), and a side of beets with candied walnuts.  Fresh, flavorful and good quality. Menu contains local and organic ingredients.  Down-to-earth vibe of the place and cozy feel, despite bring in a bit of a creepy plaza. We'll definitely be back!"
0,"Had @CousinsSubs for lunch Tuesday.\n\nThe person at the counter was very nice, and gave me the combo price for a bag of chips, even though I didn't buy them at the same time.\n\nThat being said, the 2-for-$5 sandwiches were not anything remotely approaching \""a good value\"".\n\nThe floor had visible mop streaks, likely from already-filthy water, the tables were sticky, there was a large collection of baskets on top of the trash can.\n\nI would not return here unless there was nothing else available."
0,"So rude. My doctor referred me to Dr. Simpson. The scheduling process is ridiculous and complicated. Finally when they were about to schedule me the girl puts me on hold and the office manager comes on to tell me that's it's going to be 250 dollars because I had my surgery in Mexico. I explained my situation, how I am sick and need a lap band revision and that my insurance was going to cover it! She was just rude her tone made me feel like I was trash she couldn't care less about my situation. So they really don't give a crap. I am so glad I didn't use Dr. Simpson in the first place to get my lap band, he may be a nice guy but his staff is a 0 out of 10."

0,"Overrated.  \n\nNo, make that vastly overrated.\n\nThere, I feel better, I needed to get that off my chest.\n\nWhen Glass Nickel Pizza burst on to the scene in the late '90s, they mopped the floor against weak-ass competition like Domino's, Pizza Pit and Rocky Rococo with their innovative topping combinations and fresh ingredients.  However, as local pizza market has evolved (enter Pizza Brutta, Salvatore's, Caf\u00e9 Porta Alba, Grampa's, etc.), GNP was content to rest on their laurels.  Now it's GNP getting their butt handed to them by the new breed of pizzerias.  \n\nSo word to the wise, ignore those \""Best of Madison\"" accolades, they are based on past reputation and not current performance.\n\nThe problems with GNP start with the crust - dense and largely flavorless, it overwhelms the other components of the pizza.  It's all chew and no crunch.  It also tends to be soggy in the middle, especially when you order vegetable or soft cheese toppings (yeah Fetalicious, I'm talking about you).  \n\nThe tomato sauce is OK, not as bright as I would like and at times, a little too sweet.  Their pies could use more sauce to balance out all that bland crust.\n\nThe quality of the cheese is a step below Madison's top tier pizza joints and a step above the Pizza Huts of the world.  Topping quantity varies from order to order. Sometimes GNP generously applies the toppings, while other times Scrooge McDuck seems to be in charge of the topping dispensing operation.\n\nIf you handed me a slice of Glass Nickel Pizza, I'd certainly eat it, but it's not a destination for a great slice of pizza anymore."
0,"Absolutely unimpressive place. Came here due to the myriad of 5-star reviews. Drove twice around the carpark before realising this place is literally INSIDE the Lee Lee market, and there is NO sign, not even a sandwich board, indicating this on the outside! Went in and got seated immediately. Water brought out quick. Orders taken and served quick. That's where the delight ended. They didn't have the fresh coconut that I normally get so that was disappointing.  My \""large\"" pho was ok, but I wouldn't classify it as a large. Maybe a medium. Broth tasted ok. Hardly any of the sliced beef balls or tripe, or in fact much meat at all. Small handful of bean sprouts and a single tiny lime slice provided. My kid had the crepe with bean sprouts, shrimp and pork. Yuck. I had some - the crepe tasted bland and ten minutes later, cold (my kid tried his best to delay actually eating any, can't blame him), I wouldn't have served it to a dog. Wife thought her vermicelli and BBQ pork was okay and liked the \""fresh\"" taste, but thank god the fish sauce was on the side. Ugh. Absolutely NO table service after we'd started, not even offers to refill water. Had to get up and walk around to the tiny cash register to pay. Got back to table and sat down to wait for the kid to strangle down another couple of bites and that's when I had an ice water jug held in front of me as a refill offer. Nope, done.\n\nThis place is nowhere near as efficient or generous with their portions as either Pho Thanh (Camelback) or Da Vang (19th Ave). Those who think the prices are cheap need to understand that those prices are normal for a viet place. They're all this cheap, except the ridiculously-overpriced Rice Paper on 7th Ave. Go to Pho Thanh (http://www.yelp.com/biz/pho-thanh-phoenix), order the large pho dac biet for $6.75 and run a comparison of what you get.\n\nI wouldn't go back here."
1,Excellent food good atmosphere. I reccomend the pork sandwich.
1,"This cafe is a great find.  They make the best coffee in town and you must try one of their sodas made from their special homemade syrup.  \nJust as their slogan says, \""Its not for everyone\"", this cafe will not please all.  There is no WIFI, talking on your cell phone is not permitted and they do not accept credit cards all of which is fine by me.  All these things actually help create a very interesting social environment.  Its like the Cheers of coffee shops.  The owner quickly learns your name and welcomes you as you enter.  There are barstools up at the counter where people sip their coffee and chat.  Its a very welcoming environment.\nIt worth a trip up there to see if its for you!"
1,Excellent location and the wait staff was very attentive.\n\nYou just can't beat that beer selection... my weakness.\n\nThe Cuban sandwich was VERY good!!
1,"02/16/11 DINNER: \n\nWithout planning in advance we ended up here. Didn't have a burger! Instead, had drinks, \""appetizers\"" (turned out to be plates bigger than appetizers) and desserts. The classic martini was terrific, I got the GIN variety (does no one drink gin in this town?), containing a gin of which I had never heard (\""Nolet Silver\""?) which was floral and smooth, garnished with pickled shallot. (Expecting shallot bulbs on a stick, instead it was shaved in the bottom of the glass!) Another had a\""bloody mary\"", which came \""up\"", containing pepper/cilantro infused vodka, which was greatly liked, especially the gigantic shrimp that came with it! Food was \""fried pickles\"" (fried dill spears, fried olives, caper berries, prosciutto, salami w/ herb-caper mayo), \""street tacos\"" (crispy shells filled w/ shreds of duck confit, foie gras, trufle crema & cranberry relish), \""truffle lobster mac n cheese\"" (maine lobster, black truffle & mac in a tallegio-marscapone sauce), and \""Bull's Balls\"" (2 risotto rice balls stuffed with veal, topped with \""tomato fondue\"" and a slice of lardo). A very rich, decadent collection of dishes, I thought all were very well done, especially the mac (WOW!). The \""Bulls' Balls\"" weren't as good as I had hoped, mostly rice with very little filling, and the lardo kinda lost amongst the strength of the \""tomato foudue\"", which was genius. (An angel-hair pasta with that fondue would be crazy good.) The \""street tacos\"" were really good but really rich. My fave thing on the \""fried pickles\"" were the fried olives (only 2, we had to fight over those!). Ended with a \""stout float\"" (Guinness, ice cream, oatmeal crumble), very good. After food we had a really wacky concoction: \""Johnny Apple Seed\"", consisting of Knob Creek, honey and apple cider. First of all, the very nice server said it was the first time that it had been ordered since it was added to the menu (!) and second, they had no idea what \""hard cider\"" was! We had to explain, there are alcoholic apple ciders out there, was this one of those?, but the answer never came. No matter, it was a nose and throat clearer! AHEM! But a great idea, IMHO. Sipping it took about 15 minutes, and well worth it! So overall, I'd say GO. Now I need to go back for a burger, perhaps that \""duck duck goose\"", stuffed with duck confit, duck cracklings & foie gras! YIKES!"
1,"Lobster Street Tacos were awesome! Nice portion size for the meal.\n\nI also enjoyed the twist on the chips and salsa, the basket had several different types of chips in it, which was a nice feature."
0,"It bugs me when i know what i want to order and they start telling me a 5 minute story of what state the fish came from, how it was caught, how they prepare it, how their experienced chefs cook it, and so on.... \n\nService was horrible....entered with a buddy of mine and they made him go back to his car to put on a long sleeve or jacket.  Host had PMS for sure.  Food was undercooked and displayed very sloppy.  No one looks when you need service but when you wanna be left alone, some waiter comes out to ask you how your food was, etc.  Bread sent out was stale...."
1,Late night snacks at the bar with appetizers.  Had the raw oysters on a half shell and the duck spring rolls w/ foie gras along with a glass of sauvignon blanc.  Good conversation with my buddy and his wife - late night asian-fusion heaven.
1,Went there for brunch for my aunt's birthday this place was great. I got the wagyu skirt steak and got my eggs poached. It was a perfectly cooked medium rare and the eggs were just right. My grandpa had the pancakes which I suggest trying because one bite and i was hooked. My mother got a mexican twist on eggs benedict which worked really well with jalapeno corn bread instead of english muffins and pork carnitas instead of canadian bacon  My aunt got the steak omelette which looked good but I couldn't try since I'm allergic to avocado. For dessert (like we needed it) we got the tres leche cake which was good but for me had a not so great after taste but maybe it was because of the other stuff I ate. Over all it was good and will go back again for dinner. On a side note my mom got the bottomless bloody mary which is totally worth it since one is $9 and the bottomless is $20 and it had to be the biggest glass of bloody mary I've seen so be prepared to get a lil tipsy early in the day :)
1,"Many people from The Lakes and other neighborhoods around here go to this pet shop. There is a vet next door and the shop includes a groomer. Along with the standard products, they stock great natural products, including natural diet, supplements for pets, etc. Competitive prices, coupons, dedicated and helpful staff."
1,"The food (and beer!) is consistently delicious at The Great Dane. I'm always amazed at how big and diverse the menu is here... I'd say that this would be a very good destination for groups with a variety of palates. \n\nThere's a number of Great Dane locations in and around Madison, but the environment here is the best of them all. Interesting, historic building with a really rich and comfortable interior - the basement has a gorgeous fireplace and field stone hearth that makes the space really cozy in the winter."
0,What happened to the Mineos I remember? The sauce tasted SOUR and the crust like cardboard. I'm so very disappointed because this used to be my #1 pizza place.
0,"I wanted to try something new, and this place was alright. The waiting time was so long, and I didn't find it to be the most sanitary place to eat just because the hands that prepared the food were the hands that opened and closed the door. No gloves whatsoever. I was served my food by the chef, who had creamy gunk all over his fingers. Nevertheless, I ate the taco since I was too hungry from waiting... And it was alright."
0,"We went here on a recent visit to Madison with our kids after riding the Polar Express train.  If you're not a fan of clowns and circus stuff surounding you at every turn, don't go here.  If you are looking for outstanding food, don't go here either.  After paging through the 30 page binder they call their menu, our table had a Chicago style hot dog, meatloaf and mashed potatoes, a cheeseburger, a reuben sandwich and some soup.......  We all said the same thing after we left, \""well that was a disappointment\"".\n\nThe kids really enjoyed themselves and ate most of their chicken tenders, I guess I haven't indoctrinated them enough yet into the belief that clowns and circus memorabilia  is evil.  Seriously, this may be a good place for desert and a quick look with the kids.  If you are looking for a great meal, keep looking."
1,"Yes, this place is super cool.  Super tiny; but super cool.  Try not to go with a large group or the seating will be awkward.  Their menu is really awesome -- more a lunch-type menu with sandwiches and soups.  If I remember correctly, they had a seafood soup that was only served on Fridays and it was delicious!\n\nYou can get a really decent meal with smoothie and all for around $10.  Their servers are cool and the decor is so very Montreal."
0,"Meh! Absolutely unimpressed with the sushi here. As a recent resident of Cambridge I was really excited to give this place a go, considering it had been quite awhile since I had sushi. I don't mean to be such a sushi snob, but the food was subpar. We ordered a variety of sushi but they all seemed to taste pretty bland.  As someone who LOVES sushi, I definitely won't be coming back to this place to get my sushi fix."
0,The worst service I have ever had in my life. You need different servers that actually care about your customers. I will not ever be coming back to this bar.
0,really bad and not worth the $$$  not authentic at all!!!
1,Sehr gutes Bier und das beste Steak in Karlsruhe und Umgebung. Nur einen Tisch muss man fast immer reservieren.
0,"Came here to eat today as my boss and 2 coworkers wanted to. I know People love this place, I am just not a fan, even though I want to be as I understand it is a local business. \n\nI like the decor as the owners invite customers to bring in 8x10 photos of their dogs and they display the photos on the walls around the restaurant. The also serve free peanuts, they put in dog bowls and they let you toss the shells on the floor. \n\nThe service has always been friendly and today was no exception. \n\nI knew going in I was going to ask the server for a recommendation. She said without hesitation the burgers were delicious. Sounded great, so I ordered a teryaki burger, served with mayo, pineapple, swiss & teryaki sauce. 35 minutes later our party got our food including my burger. Not sure what was the hold up as we were among maybe 10 other customers in the restaurant at lunch time. \n\nI took a bite of the burger and could instantly tell the bun on the burger was at least day old, the meat had no flavor and clearly was previously frozen. I did let the server know I did not like my burger and she took it off the bill without making me feel bad about not liking it. \n\nSo I did not get lunch today, but those who know me would say I could stand to miss a meal or two. Maybe next time I will just drink at the bar and eat free peanuts."
0,"I really wanted to like SOL Cocina, but for me it was a big misfire.  I know, I know they've only been open 9 days, but there were rookie errors that should never have occurred with an experience restauranteur or issue that a soft opening should have handled.\n\nWe wanted to try this new restaurant for our friend's birthday, so I diligently made reservations a day in advance (they are not yet set up on open table).  We arrived on time, but they weren't ready.  They tried to set us up on a bar table, but we wanted a regular table which we had to stand and wait for 30 minutes.  The three hostesses blamed the problem on a failed computer system, but there seemed to be plenty of tables and they just wouldn't seat us, because they said the computer problem messed up their ordering system.  After waiting a half hour I finally demanded they seat us and take our order the old-fashioned way -- by hand.\n\nTo their credit, the restaurant decor is lovely.  The tables a beautiful real wood rustic hand-hewn tables.  The indoor/outdoor vibe is great for this time of year.  But they do have an issue in the bar area with the direction their tables are set up.  All the tables are set up in an east/west direction so when the sun sets you are literally blinded by the sun.  A simple solution would be to turn the tables to that they face north/south.  Also, once the sun set the restaurant goes to dark, soft lighting.  Not unusual for a restaurant, but with the poor lighting and the thin font on the menu, it is nearly impossible to read the menu.  Come prepared -- bring a flashlight and reading glasses because you'll need them.\n\nOn to food and drinks.  The appetizers were really good.  We had the Guacamole Sol which was good, but the Warm Goat Cheese appetizer was really outstanding.  I can't say the same for my husband's drink.  The waiter recommended the Grande Clase Azul Margarita.  We like margaritas, but we did not like the taste of this one which was more of a case of quantity not quality.  It was strong -- super strong, but all you tasted was tequila and very little of the margarita flavor that we know and love.\n\nOn to dinner, my husband and I ordered the Grilled Fish Zarandeado.  In my opinion very average and not much flavor.  Plus it was very wet below the tortilla so when I went to pick the taco up to eat it, the whole thing fell apart.  The rice was okay, but the black beans were really not to my liking.  All together and even with the sauces the flavors were very bland.  Which was extremely surprising for Mexican food.  One kind of tends to expect spicy and flavorful food.  However, our friend had the sweet potato black bean taco and she liked it a lot.\n\nLastly on to service.  While our waiter was nice and a dedicated educator about all the menu items, service was very slow.  We had brought in a specialty cake for our friend's birthday which they very graciously served.  We all promptly ordered coffee to go with the cake.  20 minutes later we were still staring at our cake waiting for coffee.  We finally called the waiter over and asked about the coffee and he said they were out of coffee and it would take another 5-10 minutes to make some more.  We promptly ate our cake without coffee and cancelled the order.  To the waiter's credit, he brought us 4 cups of coffee right before we were  gathering our stuff to leave and said the manager would comp the coffee, but by this time it was 9pm and we were ready to leave.   Interestingly, our original reservation was for 6:30 and we didn't leave until after 9pm.  We like long and leisurely dining when it is our choice, not when it's because of slow service, computer problems, etc.\n\nI know the restaurant is only 8 days old, but it may be 8 months before we give it another try.  Hopefully, by then, they will have worked out all their problems."
1,"I wouldn't normally review a chain restaurant, but this one is literally around the corner from me. In the year or so since they've opened this location, I've always received friendly, speedy, good service & my orders have been spot on! \n\nGreat location too, there's a self serve frozen yogurt place down the sidewalk for dessert & other foodie places if your friends all don't agree on one place to eat :) \n\nThe bowls & soft tacos are my personal favorites."
1,"I have been going to UNLV for 4 years now and have never had an issue with this gym. I love being in it! Their classes are creative and exciting. The instructors are always hyper and upbeat, which makes you excited to be working out. There are so many varieties of equipment that can be used. I love the basketball courts, volleyball courts, racquetball, and so forth. The pool is amazing as well! You honestly are crazy if you do not love this place. \n\nThe thing I love the most is that their are TV screens attached to some of the ellipticals or treadmills which makes watching my shows and working out a productive evening.\n\nI have yet to go, but I am dying to try them. There are massage chairs on the third floor where you can use them for 30min. I seriously need to try it. They are in the Wellness Center office. I can never get there before they close though. \n\nEinstein's Bagel shop, power shakes, or smoothies! They have everything here."
1,"Great coffee, vibe, and food. \n\nTERRIBLE parking, take the light rail if you can!"
1,"I am now a huge fan of Switch. This awesome steak and seafood house located in the Encore was one of the finest meals I have ever had in Las Vegas. It's also home to the largest wine list I have ever laid eyes on.\n\nOur server, Will was one of the main contributing factors to this as well as the amazing food and a restaurant ambiance that hasn't seen it's equal. \n\nWill was very patient with us as we looked over the menu. The level of quality service that he provided was astounding. He offered thorough explanations as well as suggestions on what we should try. We ended up ordering the lobster mac and cheese, green tea spiced ahi, and Montana bison. Yes, bison.\n\n-Vermont cheddar mac and cheese with Maine lobster: $18\nA very perfect portion of the best mac and cheese this stomach has ever digested. We both don't like mac and cheese but loved this one. The lobster portions in here were nicely cut and prepared. \n\n-Green tea spiced ahi tuna: $42\nThis was served with lentils and endive. It was a HUGE cut of ahi. Very fresh and seared to perfection. The green tea added a nice dimension of flavor here. I've had a lot of seared ahi in my day but none like this. Amazing.\n\n-Montana bison rib eye : $48\nThis was served with a very nice port wine sauce. It was cooked medium well and it remained juicy throughout. The bison was very lean and tasted very clean. It had no gamey taste at all. Very impressive.\n\n-Caramelized profiteroles : $12\nThink of these as very small cream puffs. I had never heard of this dessert before dining at Switch. The puffs were full of flavor and very light. It was the perfect way to end the meal. We didn't want to get bogged down at all: we had shopping to do.\n\nSo why call this place Switch? Well every 20 minutes the restaurant itself transforms. Wall panels give way to one of three different types and even the ceiling opens up and recesses to give a different point of decor for the discerning customer. This was a very nice touch and although I knew it was going to happen ahead of time thanks to Yelp reviews, they can't really prepare you for the real deal. I had never seen anything like it before in my life.\n\nSo thank you Switch, Will, and Montana bison for a culinary experience that will always be remembered."
0,"I made a few trips to this mall during our week in the Phoenix area.  \n\nThe Nike Outlet was great, but otherwise, there weren't that many quality outlet stores.  Most (or so it seemed to me) of the stores in this mall are not outlets and there just weren't the deals that I was expecting."
1,"First appearances can be deceiving!  Hubby and I were feeling a bit nervous when we pulled into the Sahara Commercial Center - that place just looks sad!  But oh, everything brightened when we walked into Namaste and tried their $9.99 lunch buffet.  Every single item tasted excellent - we filled our plates with all kinds of delicious things like butter chicken, navaratna korma, aloo palak, masala mutton ... and then the waiter brought us a basket of fresh hot butter naan to the table.  Oh yeah!  But it got even better, several minutes later, he brought us a freshly cooked plate of uttapam - yes you read that right!   We love South Indian snacks and it's just not so easy to find that here in Vegas.  That little touch pushed us into masala bliss!    The other cool thing that will draw us back for a dinner is that they serve quite a few Goan specialties, such as chicken xacutti and Goan shrimp curry - all quite amazing and different from their Northern Indian style counterparts.  Happy eating!"
1,"Came here President's day weekend and it was packed. \n\nThanks to Kenny L. we were able to get in pretty quickly (20 minutes) and without cover charges ! Yay! (why is this amazing you ask? because we had 5 guys in our group of 9) Yes. It's practically a miracle in Vegas on a Saturday night of a 3 day weekend.\n\nThe inside of the club was pretty nice, lots of lights (surprise surprise!) and acrobats in the sky. Music was dance-able to and the drinks were not too watered down. Girls get 2 free drinks before midnight. Kinda small compared to places like XS though because they don't have an outdoor area. BUT they don't have too many stairs (just 2 flights at the most I think) and that is the BEST part in my opinion lol. \n\nThe worst part is the wait for the bathroom, which pretty much goes true for every single busy club everywhere. \n\nOther than that, would I be choose Light again next time? Sure, why not!"
0,"I normally let things go but this time I truly had to speak up because I will feel like I'll do future guests of Flamingo a disservice if I didn't. \n\nI reluctantly made reservations to stay at Flamingo hotel after my cousin assured me the hotel had been renovated, otherwise, I would have never dreamt of staying in a dump like this. Because we were attending a wedding and my daughter was the flower girl, we had to bring the kids so we needed to stay in a hotel with a great pool. When I looked up on the website, and the pool looked great.  I called the hotel and specifically asked the concierge if the pool shown in the website with the waterfalls would allow children and he told me that the pool did indeed allow children.  \n\nOnce we got to Las Vegas, we found out the valet service was full.  We were also informed that the parking structure serving Flamingo is also full.  We asked a parking attendant where to go, and he shrug his shoulder and said:  \""don't know what to tell ya.  It took my husband 2 hours to come back from parking the car.  They quickly sell you a room but they don't provide you with the parking.\n\nOur room was supposed to be non-smoking.  However, the smell of smoke was unbearable. Walking down the hall I found cigarette butts in all the ash trays and some on the floors which never got picked up.   \n\nThe next day we went to the pool. Kids were so excited to go to the pool but we found out that the pool for the kids is the small pool and the wonderful pool with the water falls is for people over 21.  I was livid.  I felt I had been tricked.  \n\nThe next morning at 6 a.m. I woke up with to find our room flooded. My interactions with the hotel staff regarding this incident were so upsetting that I told my husband we should leave a day early and go home.  Not only they were not apologizing for the inconvenience, they were a bit cocky,  Only the manager was sympathetic.  THE WORST SERVICE I HAVE EVER EXPERIENCED FROM A HOTEL.  \n\nAt the end, they refunded us $100.00 off of our 3 night stay.  Was it worth it? You be the judge...."
1,I was in a bikini contest here and had a blast! The only thing I didn't like is I had to go through like three security checks when getting in... Kind of ridiculous.
1,"Mamma better slap me, because I just sinned... \n\nLet me explain, I just got spoiled, I was rewarded with delicious food, and I didn't do anything to deserve it.  You heard me, landed in Charlotte and after checking into my hotel, I decided to B-Line it to Mert's; because there was a need in me to have some good food, and I got delicious food.  \n\nFirst let me comment on the service... it was genuinely amazing.  I was promptly seated, and the hospitality was refreshing.  The server helped me patiently figure out what was good, and we settled on Southern Fried Chicken, Collard Greens and Mac & Cheese.  The Cornbread came out first, and it was mildly sweet, and tasty. \n\nLet's break down the meal.\n\nFried Chicken:  From the moment I took my first bite of the chicken breast, it was perfect cooked, juicy and hot, the meat was lightly battered, and the batter that was on it, was seasoned well.  It was a one of the better pieces of friend chicken I have had, not dry at all.   I would eat this every day, if I lived here, and I didn't have to worry about eating fried foods.  Recommendation, eat it, yum. \n\nCollard Greens:  I've had collard greens before, and this was good as most.  Admittedly, never had it with tomato before, but it was still delicious.  I liked the flavor, and the greens were tender, soft but with a nice bite.  The portion of the side was right, and complemented the chicken right.\n\nMac and Cheese: Yes Sir, this stuff was creamy, delicious, sauce done with tons of cheese flavor.  It was cooked right, because you don't see any sauce/oil separation.  In fact, all you do is taste the various textures, from the small clumps of cheese, to the noodles which are just cooked past al dente, but not much after.  It's like creamy goodness, yummy heaven, sometimes, I think you can make Mac and Cheese just the entire meal. \n\nHere we go, I love good food... but like a good infomercial... THERE'S MORE!\n\nWhat in the world is a Sweet Potato Cake?  That's lovely stuff, I had some, and it's like a tasty and the cream cheese frosting was amazing.  I think they spiked it, crazy amazing, not overly sweet, the texture was nice, and it melts in the mouth.\n\nHere's the kicker; I ate all the food and this doesn't really happen much, but it was perfect portion.  I'm 6'1, about 225lbs, and I thought all this southern comfort food would leave me heavy; but nope, it was just the right amount, and all for 15 dollars, with a coke.  \n\nLike many other Yelpers, KICK ASS food. Location isn't easy to find at first, but you want food, and you are in downtown, make this a perfect spot, for you and all your friends."
1,"Half price wings has moved from Tuesday to Thursday, so we were bummed when we expected to get half price wings the last Tuesday we went to find out they aren't doing them on that day anymore.  Nonetheless, their burgers are amazing and so tasty.  But my favorite is that they have Taro bubble tea shakes which I can't find ANYWHERE ELSE in Charlotte, so this is my go to place when I am in my Asian bubble tea mood.  Check them out, you'll love them!"
1,Guacamole bacon jalape\u00f1o burger with mango salsa... tickles my tongue just thinking about it. Chili cheese fries are a guilty pleasure.  Been here a few times and they always have something different on the menu.  It's very clean and the staff is fast and friendly.  Love supporting local businesses!
1,"I enjoyed this show enough that I went back on a later trip to Vegas with my wife.\n\nShe hated it.  She thought Penn was obnoxious and way too long-winded, and she didn't really care much for the magic tricks.\n\nI personally like his antics, and I like *most* of their tricks.  Some of them I could do without.  Penn's fire-eating, meh, I've seen fire eating before, big deal.\n\nI recall another skit with Teller playing the saxophone and making a piece of paper float along the stage... that looked extremely fake and not at all impressive.  Not sure what the point was.\n\nJuggling broken glass was so-so and involved a little too much ranting by Penn.\n\nThe infamous double bullet catch is a little too longwinded, and when you're sitting a hundred feet away, it's difficult to be all that impressed.\n\nI guess this review *sounds* pretty negative, but as I said earlier, I enjoyed it.  I don't want to give away all of the *GOOD* tricks."
1,The staff was nice n friendly. Pizza was good. Need a few more cheese options but they had pasta as well. I will come back for a good pizza with a friendly staff. Location does not have much foot traffic. Overall it was a good pizza with a friendly staff.
1,"Very tasty. Had the Ahi Tuna Steak cooked medium. Spectacular. Got the truffle mac for a side and was not disappointed. Waitress had wonderful recommendations for sides and drinks for the ladies.\n\nNot a huge tap beer selection but I'm sure they'll get their crap together after demand for them goes up. \""Premium\"" beer list has Spotted Cow, Blue Moon, and one other tap I couldn't remember.\n\nNo line at 730 on Tuesday night. Will probably be very busy for a while being so new."
1,"I actually found this guy on Yelp.  I purchased some sandals last fall on sale, and unfortunately, I needed some extra holes punched in to them because they were hurting my feet.  I had tried to exchange them at the store, but because it had been so long, I was unable to do so.  I was encouraged by the store to find a local shoe store to just get holes punched into the straps to accomidate my situatation.\n\nSo, I find this guy on Yelp.  I called in advance to see if he would be able to help me.  He said he could, and that he was open until 3.  So, I race over there, and he punched the holes in my sandals while I waited!  wooohoo! I was so grateful!\n\nHe charged me 50 cents a whole, times 4 holes for a whole $2!  This is great! \n\nThe store itself is small, but organized and rather clean.  They sell all kinds of shoe stuff, and do all kinds of repairs not only just to shoes, but luggage, zippers, etc.  He says he's been in business for 16 years now, and to keep coming back.  Good experience for something so simple and mondane."
1,The service here is awesome. The owner makes you feel welcome and appreciated. Pizza is made fresh. It is good pizza and the service makes it great. The wings are awesome.
1,"I know, a ton of reviews of this place but i find it interesting that people either seem to love it or really just don't get it. It sort of reminds me of when pulp fiction came out and you either thought it was a masterpiece (I did) or just didn't get it. So maybe Casey Moore's is the dining equivalent of pulp fiction. It certainly has that sort of gritty feel to it. However, after my last lunch review I have found myself going back for lunch several times and even for a nosh on an early Sunday evening and...it is all good. On Sunday my friend ordered the curry chicken soup and it was like...wow, everything you would expect out of a curry soup and perfect with a nice salad. At lunch the service continues to be good and the food not only reasonable but it continues to taste great.\n\nNow, I do understand that it has a bit of a different ambiance when it is busier but that that has a certain charm as well though when I really want to enjoy a good beer I find myself wondering over to Taste of Tops to experience one of their ever changing micro-brews. However, for a nice lunch in a dark bar, or hanging out at a happy hour at the end of a week with some friends, it is great for that as well.\n\nAs for the four stars..I will admit, service can be a bit slow but people...learn to catch the eye of your server! Consider it a wonderful opportunity for some training in dining assertiveness and then just enjoy the vibe."
0,Ordered the beef yakisoba lunch box. Yakisoba lacked flavor.
0,"First, I'm only rating 1 star because they don't have a negative 5 trillion.\nThe fact that they use \"" New York\"" in the title is a down right insult!! New Yorkers would spit on this pizza, actually it tastes like they did! I would serve this to some ny rats but I would be scared for their health! \n\nNow for the specifics. Who do you think you are charging that much for a horrible eating experience! If you are going to charge 2 bux a topping it better not taste like bacon bits! We ordered wings and asked for extra crispy. They came burnt, over cooked and floating in oil! Just not edible! \n\nThe pizza crust is rubber and just strange tasting! The sauce is filled with sugar, and it was runny! Watery and not filled with goodness. Toppings were not fresh at all. \n\nThe location is ify,when you walk in its dark and filled with sadness. It took 5 mins at the counter for someone to even say hi \n\nIn closing I can not believe this place is still open let alone a chain that people keep pouring money into! \n\nSeriously though I had better pizza at a gas station for 2 bux! You should be ashamed of yourself"
1,"Lux!  What a place!  Their coffee drinks are addictive and rapturously good. From their coffee to their chai teas to their lemonade. Don't even get me started on their baked goods!  The pastries are masterpieces and consistently delicious. The staff are friendly and invested in every customer who walks into the place.   The live DJ cannot be beat!  Finding a spot to lounge can get tricky at times because it does get crowded but one can't blame others for wanting to be there to enjoy the coffee, food and ambiance."
1,"Only 8 calories an ounce!!!  The red velvet cake and peanut butter flavors were so creamy and only 48 calories in the small.  My only gripe is the high price of toppings (over $1 a topping).  Overall, it was worth paying for a tasty low calorie treat."
1,"My normal stylist switched salons and works a bit farther away so I came here based on the recommendation of one of my friends.  I'm glad I did!  \n\nI got a hair cut from Rachel today and everything went great.  She did a wonderful job chopping off inches of damaged hair and even gave some helpful recommendations on a style.  She never tried to push any products and was very easy to talk to.  Even though the place was packed, she took her time to make sure I was happy about my haircut.  She styled it nicely even though I just had boring errands to run afterwards.  I felt fabulous toting my bottled water around Costco, walking around Fry's with my sunblock, and sipping a mocha cookie crumble frapp at Starbucks with my pinky up.  Since I'm off to a pool party tomorrow, I opted to not dye my hair today but I definitely know where to go when I get around to do so!  \n\nYou've won me over, Studio 3-26.  I'll be back.  :)"
0,"Run, don't walk, as fast as you can away from this business!!! My husband and I recently purchased a patio set from Patio Star and the minute we walked out and they had our credit card information, our experience went from decent to exceptionally poor. Essentially we had to call 8, yes 8 times to confirm our set was even coming, during which time we experienced hostile, unfriendly, and unprofessional service people. When the set was finally delivered, we learned the cushions were still not finished as initially promised, and again we had to place several calls to locate and ensure delivery of the correct cushions 2 weeks later. The young delivery boys mentioned we were receiving the floor model (which we never agreed to), and this too was yet another unexpected problem to be worked out. This business is ridiculously unorganized, unprofessional, borderline unethical, and should be ashamed of the way their customers are treated. Please inform family and friends to stay away, as we have and continue to do."

You can learn about history.  You can stand in a room full of Mylar balloons blowing all around you.  You can learn all about how AW made art.  You can be in the exploding plastic inevitable!!!!!!\n\nMy inner beagle is satisfied."
0,"there's this commercial. order a medium or larger drink and get an egg and cheese english muffin for $.99. seemed like a good deal to me, and i was hungry this morning. besides, dunkin' has been making great strides in quality and service, right? that's what the marketing would have you believe anyway. so i order from the drive thru and pay $3.15 for a medium iced coffee and the aforementioned egg and cheese english muffin. service is swift. i drive away, ready to dig into my sandwich on the parking lot that is the 101. that's when things get ugly. my sandwich is cold. like, you can feel how cold it is through the paper bag. i can't eat it, mainly because i'm afraid it will sicken me in some way ... i don't screw around with egg. and yes, i'm still hungry. \n\nso, sorry dunkin', your marketing gal is a genius, but this store did not deliver. shame on me for believing that silly marketing ploy."
1,"Always excellent service--the food is amazing too, but the service is top notch and keeps me coming back several times a week! :)"
0,"Myself and two friends came here to only get terrible service, comically bad. Our appetizer showed up two hours after we ordered it, after we had eaten our meal, and after we had asked to cancel it. And they still charged us for it. \n\nAlmost none of the adult beverages on the menu were available.\n\nWe all got food poisoning too. \n\nBaffled this place is still open."
0,I like the store because of their prices but I have a hard time with the clientele at this particular location.  It's not that I'm a snob... It's just a rough crowd.  \n\nOne thing that the store could greatly improve on is having friendlier staff and always having an attendant at the self checkout line. That seems to always be a shortfall for them.
1,"Never write a Yelp review when your stomach is grumbling. Also, never say never.\n\nI've been thinking about this place ever since I finally tried it last night. Let's cut to the good stuff. To start, we shared some calamari tempura and they were delicious! I usually see tempura as just a single ingredient dipped in the batter, but these had some nice complexity to it with the calamari wrapped around some sort of green veggie (I'm so not a foodie).\n\nFor the main course, I had a chirashi bowl with cold soba. I've never had soba before and I thoroughly enjoyed it. The sashimi in the bowl was not Kabuto-level, but it was nevertheless utterly delectable. Though it may not look like a lot of food, I finished the dish completely satisfied.\n\nThe cold barley tea that they serve was the perfect complement to the meal. To top it off, they had some sort of shamisen rendition of Michael Jackson's Beat It playing. It was quite fitting for the three-year anniversary of his passing.\n\nOh and the service was extremely friendly. I shall return."
0,"The \""hot\"" sandwich came out just warm(as a result of it being left out after it was toasted) and I feel I got shafted on the portions. There are definitely better options than this."
0,"CLOSED\n\nLooks like another one bites the dust...\n\ngreat location, great prices, good portions, good service but HORRIBLE food maybe cause its a Canadian company...next time when the sign says \""Made in Japan\""...maybe the food or company should actually come from there."
0,"Where to start , I called for my birthday to make reservations for a party of 6 and was told by the rude hostess  that I couldn't get my party in until 1030 As they had other big tables that night I said that would be fine as we were gonna be dtown anyways. We showed up on time and told the again rude hostess that we had one more she told me we would then have to wait for another table to open up I replied we had one more and a few weren't even eating we could squeeze them in she told me no and with a bad attitude told me I could juSt talk to her manager if I didn't like it I told her I would the manager came up already with the same bad attitude as the hostess and told us to bad. I told her also some weren't eating and we could squeeze them she said no so when asked how long we would have to wait she told me well I don't know with a face like I was stupid for asking. I told them I didn't want the tAble and would take my party of 8else where. To bad we drink and would of spent money a loss on their part"
1,Probably the best Italian food I have had so far the in the valley. Our waiter was very friendly as well. This is more of a spot to bring your significant other then a group full of kids.
0,would not do again. Was sooooo disappointed in the food!!! I also expected a complementary mimosa or bloody Mary..but alas it was serve yourself at the bar OJ and tepid coffee. There was no table service..but they wanted you to tip...I don't get it.
0,"It's ok- last year we had Golfland Sunsplash season passes and were planning to go there again this year but when they had a one day only 12 hour super sale on season passes and I just so happened to be working a 12 hour shift that day-they peeved me into buying Big Surf season passes.\n\nNow-Big Surf, is a bit nicer and more relaxed than Sunsplash, but it could definately use some cleaning and care. The staff are mostly high school age and have no customer service or training-so next year Big Surf could save money on staffing and just hire monkeys or hyenas because either would do the job better than what's working there now.\n\nIf you go with really low expectations, you are going to have a great time.\n\nThe food is mediocre and pricey. The parking is free and ample. The large wave pool is nice and full of pee. How do I know? I never see anyone in the bathrooms.\n\nThe slides are average.\n\nAgain, go with low expectations and all is going to be fine."
0,"Went to dinner tonight and got horrible service, nothing worse than serving you a semi-warm overpriced beer in a warm glass. Food was ok way overpriced."
0,"CONS-\n\nRoom 229- A/C unit sounded like a tank and knocked louder than hell. I booked on price line.com because of the \""pet friendly\"" rating. When I checked in, the front desk told me it was a $15 per night, per pet deposit! Nothing about that on the website. Lots of seedy looking characters walking around at night. Only one towel provided, and told \""we don't have enough linen\"" to give extra, or a pillow. Wifi connection sucks, and is super slow.\n\nPros- cheap. Lots of parking. Room was pretty clean."
0,"I really can't add anything that hasn't already been said.  Save yourself a lot of $$ and DO NOT go here unless you already purchased a Groupon.  In that case use the Groupon and then ask for a refund because the food is THAT BAD.  The food is also way over priced.  Lethal combo in my book.  The service was OK, but not great by any means."
1,"There's this little thing called Love. And I really do love this place. I love the food, I love the atmosphere, I love the mahalo that they spread in return.\n\nIt is not your typical Aloha grinds place but take Hawaiian eats like kalua pig, huli huli chicken, pulehu steak, grilled fish and mix it up with a serving style of something to similar to Chipotle and you have Braddah's.\n\nMy go to eats are typically a bowl with a bed of seaweed brown rice, a mix of half huli huli chicken and kalua pig, black beans, cabbage, lime, jalapenos, bean sprouts, cilantro, and a mix of mango and roasted corn salsa and tomato with maui onions salsa. I also like to add on a serving of grilled veggies which costs you an extra $1.25. \n\nYou could also choose to add a pineapple verde salsa, lettuce, sour cream, cheese, guacamole ($1.65 extra) and salad dressing options from either papaya buttermilk ranch or roasted sesame gingerette. I am a fan of both salad dressings too.\n\nAnd the kiddos are not left out here either. They have a kids menu as well that comes with a drink and chips, we also go with a nice cheesy quesadilla. \n\nYou can opt for other options instead of a bowl, you can go with 3 tacos, salad, bowl or burrito. You can double your meat for around $2 I believe. The burritos are huge here FYI. You definitely get your money's worth.\n\nThe food is solid. I might have to add a little salt and pepper to my bowl but I leave with a full and more importantly a very happy belly. \n\nLas but definitely least, the best part of my eats are the dessert. They have this amazing salty and sweet coconut bark and it is just love. pure love. They had a holiday bark around Christmas time which in my opinion was better than the regular coconut bark and I anticipate the return of it again. Either way the bark will break da mouth. It is that good.\n\nI think I am going to have to go again today after writing this review. I need some Braddah's."
0,"Although the side dishes were fairly tasty, this was easily the worst service ever encountered.  We had to wait more than 35 minutes to receive our Udon noodle soup.  Seriously folks, I'm no Chef, but I'm pretty confident that it doesn't take 35+ minutes to make hot soup.  Additionally, the waitress never got around to our table to refill our drinks.  The amount of customers here was not even close to being overwhelming.  This is the first and last time that we'll dine here."
0,"$40 cover for guys, $20 for girls.  Drinks are normal club prices.  This club reminds me of a 2 story Bank (at the Bellagio).  No air ventilation, filled with smoke and jackass bartenders makes me never want to go here again unless either TIESTO is spinning, or I get in for free.\n\nI'll stick with XS or try Vanity"
0,"As we had done in previous years following a Steelers game, we came to this place as it was conveniently located from our hotel, the Sheraton Station Square. The eight of us sat in a booth that had a few dishes remaining from the previous customers. Around 15 minutes passed without anyone greeting us for service or removing the dishes. Finally a young girl came to take our order. She apologized and cleaned off our table.\n\nWe ordered and then waited at least 30 minutes. A girl from our group went to question what was going on. Eventually the manager came out, apologized and said the food would be out in 3 minutes. At least 10 minutes passed. We questioned him again this time verbally expressing our irritation. He mentioned he fired 4 workers and took the blame. Regardless, we were all disgruntled.\n\nThen several minutes later the waitress came out and said she did not have any avocado and another ingredient and a few of our dishes could not be made. This was something they could have told us before we ordered and had to wait 40 or so minutes. One of the dishes that was supposed to have bacon came with baco bits instead. \n\nThe manager agreed to not bill us for the few items we received and with that we got up and left.\n\nWhile I do give credit to the manager and particularly to the young girl who was apologetic and did her best despite the circumstances, I find this kind of service unacceptable. This place is clearly mismanaged and this level of service has convinced me to never ever come to this bar again.\n\nIn order for this or any establishment to retain customers, it is important that they are fully prepared to service customers and if they are not then they at least communicate that to us early on so that our time is not wasted."
1,Will never skip an appointment to the dentist I have found my my guy....
1,Fabulous all the way around! \nAmbiance feels authentic like you have just walked in an old Irish pub!\nComplete with live music! Ordered a salad fresh quality and different in a good way! \n Best soup ever is the Colcannon soup! OMG I will be craving this the rest of my life! Fabulous service and laid back crowd!
1,"We loved everything except for 1 thing..\nAMAZING kalbi ribs, rock & roll, aria, coco shrimp, avocado bomb. Order it all!\nDidn't like the red rock. Weird consistency and lacked something. Just doesn't work. \n\nAlso our avocado bomb barely had avocado unlike the previous pics posted.  We were kinda bummed about that."
1,"Pete and Derek very good. ..i'm happy and satisfied! They were right on time at 9 AM . They were careful with our stuff , no complaints , no damages .\nPete and Derek were nice and polite as well. Thank you Warren's. ..:)"
0,Boring is the word that comes to mind. The pizza was flavorless and soggy. We took it home and rebaked it added some spice and it was ok. Had frozen that was better. There has been a management change int the last couple of months so that may explain but we had one slice and threw it out.
0,"My husband and I are staying here with our two year old for several days on vacation and it wasn't as good as I was expecting, but it's not completely awful. The best part about it is the free parking and the free Internet as well as it's close proximity to the former Olympic Park along with the Biodome, Botanical Gardens, etc.\n\nCheck in went very well, especially considering we didn't get here until nearly 10pm.  The front desk staff, that night, were very welcoming and polite, especially for 2 Americans who don't speak a word of French. We did call down the first night to ask for a sheet for the pack and play/crib and two days later still haven't received it. My husband packed a full size light blanket, so we've just been using that instead. \n\nTheir \""breakfast buffet\"" is a joke, especially at $9.99 per person. We only went the first morning, but that was all we needed to make it clear it's not worth it. They only served scrambled eggs, bacon and sausage, home fries (the best part of the whole shebang) and some really sad looking pancakes.  They also had two cold cereal options and coffee/orange juice.  The wait staff was nice enough. \n\nWe're in an unrenovated room because we read that the renovated rooms aren't large enough to put a crib in and we definitely needed one.  The beds are comfy enough and the room is large enough for the 3 of us, but the bathroom is pretty bad. I'm pretty short (5'3\"") and the shower head is pretty much perfect for me.  My husband is pretty tall (6'3\"") and it's pretty low for him.  The room has a small refrigerator in it, which is awesome because we travelled with a cooler of drinks and some food, but it also allowed us to get some breakfast type foods to keep in our room for the mornings. \n\nAll in all, I suppose I would stay here again if I was looking for a decent place that wouldn't cost an arm and a leg for an extended stay. If it was just a few days, I'd look for a nicer place with all the creature comforts for a person with first world type problems, like shower heads being too low."
1,Food and service both great. I had the basil fried rice and my friend had the chicken pad thai!
0,"Went to p&g in millvale. A very popular and bustling breakfast spot. Ordered the blueberry crepes,. There's a picture posted on this page of these crepes and don't they look yummy? But what if you bit into yours and discovered the blueberries were frozen, and there was a layer of  permafrost over them? Would you tell your waitress, \""hey! My blueberries are frozen.\"" And what if your waitress said \""that's the way we serve them.\"" ? And if you said you really didn't want ice cold crepes on a frigid winter morning, but had instead looked forward to a hot breakfast, and she said there wasn't anything she could do because that's the way we serve them, would you write this review?  I understand Pamela is over on her new Squirrel Hill Deli's yelp page telling people if they don't like the food no charge, but I couldn't even get my crepes heated up at P&G."
0,"This was our first time at this restaurant.  We went later in the evening when the place was almost empty. The food was OK.  Nothing to get excited about.   We were disappointed in how long it took the waiter to get back to us to take our order.  We had to ask someone to go get him.  Our waiter proceeded to sit down at the table next to us after we received our food and visited the entire time with what it seemed like old family \""friends\"".  Sure he would get up now and then and refill our tea, however, we were unimpressed with this type of service.  He also had 2 other tables besides ours to wait on.   We know all about his personal life, when he is finishing up his schooling, etc.  I guess we are spoiled by going to other places in town.  My husband said that with the way the economy is restaurants should be jumping to make sure the customers want to come back and eat at their establishment.  There are way to many  good places to eat.  Thank goodness we used a gift card that I received at Christmas.  I can't imagine paying full price for the service we received.  We were disappointed but it would have been worse if we would have had to pay for the entire meal ourselves."
0,"Try Hards - should know better\n\nI am a self confessed Hop Head who has loved every moment of the \""Craft Beer Revolution\"". The spread of US style beers across bars and pubs has been seismic in Edinburgh, rocking the foundations of a traditionally real ale loving city. So you can imagine my excitement when I heard about the Hanging Bat, so much range and so close to my flat, it can't be true! Opening in a formerly tres dodgy bar called Mr Modos, and filling the rather threatening void that was the middle of Lothian Road. The idea of a pub crawl from Cloisters to the Red Squirrel  (including Lebowskis, Black Bird, Blue Blazer and The Brauhaus - possibly) became far more tantalising with a stop off at Edinburgh's newest Craft beer Haven.\n\nDespite murmurs of being open in time for the Festival they were fashionably late and opened mid winter. I made it in on one of their first nights, and was blown away by the size of their range, and enjoyed sampling quite a few of what was on offer. Now, the beer is first class, but we all know the beer doesn't make the pub, it's a combination of things.\n\nI have sampled their food and its good, I don't think it deserves the gushing plaudits I have read here, but it is good pub fare, ideal for session drinking. It is worth pointing out that they do serve a good deal of hig ABV beers, but also some fine lower ones, Kernel's Table Beer for example is great at well below 4%, line them up!\n\n The service, yes it's OK, the staff are uber trendy  and you can't help notice that they seem more interested in 'behind the bar banter' than actually engaging with their clientele. I see other visitors having the same problem, further emphasised by a rather oddly placed bar counter that creates a bottle neck in the middle of the bar - it's  almost as if they don't want you to stand at the bar and have a drink - go and sit at a couch and come back when you want further access to my encyclopaedic knowledge of beer. I'm sure that's not exactly what they are thinking, but it's how they have made me feel on more than one occasion!\n\nI have already hit on the design, but the d\u00e9cor and layout just doesn't click for me, it feels awkward and unwelcoming. Security on the door is fine, and I think most likely essential considering the hit and miss area they are in.\n\nSo, its 2 stars, not because I don't like it. I have been in numerous times since they opened, and will go again. It is 2 stars because I think they have missed the target, and I expected so much more. The range alone will not make me stay beer after beer. It's a combination of things and this is a recipe that just doesn't seem to work, like Smoked Strawberries or Balsamic Ice Cream...."
1,"I was visiting from Los Angeles for my little sister's birthday & was skeptical because I'm usually a \""stick with what I know\"" kind of person. Oh, & I'm serious about my cupcakes! =) Well, Cupcake Lane did NOT disappoint! They were exceptional. My sister was excited & loved them. I will recommend them to all my local friends. Thank You!"
0,"About a month ago I went in for a late night snack and Chip was sitting on the couch with papers scattered everywhere.  He was talking on his cellphone, sounding anxious and disorganized.  They didn't look open, but the lady at the counter rang me up for some cookies anyway.  She then insisted I take a flyer describing their \""stock\"" program and that I \""tell all my friends\"".  They apparently were supposed to open a half dozen new locations and were going to sell at a supermarket that I had never heard of (but that was supposedly where Compare Foods is located).  I would imagine these \""shares\"" they were selling would just be a printed copy of a Microsoft Word document.  3/4 of it would be Chip's giant head, the rest a little statement: \""Good for one Share of Chip Nutty Cookies\"".  It seemed a little odd, so I just threw it away.  A few weeks later I heard that Chip skipped town with investors' money, and hadn't paid his employees in weeks.  I'll miss those cookies, but, man... what a weird dude.  I still maintain the previous 5 star review because the food was good, and the place had some potential, but Chip screwed it up by going all Bernie Madoff on the community."
0,"Very disappointed with my experience yesterday!  Being a new restaurant I expected first week bugs.  Customer service is very important to me and today Haymaker missed the mark.  \n\nUpon arriving we were greeted and seated quickly.  We were hoping to order breakfast but was told it was no longer an option because they stopped taking orders for breakfast at 11:30 (though it was 11:25 at the time).  Not a problem, their lunch menu looked great.  We waited for 20 minutes for about first contact with one if the wait staff.  We asked for recommendations when we were greeted by the waitress and, with her recommendation, ordered our food and drinks at the same time.   We then proceeded to wait for over an hour food.  About 50 minutes in, we were told that they were sorry for the wait they were having difficulty in the kitchen transitioning from breakfast to lunch.  We politely thank her and recognized that we understood.  About 65 minutes into our wait, our food arrived.  We ordered a French Dip sandwich and their BLAT (bacon, lettuce, avocado & fried tomato).  The French Dip was great, a little soggy but had a great taste.  The BLAT was very dry and lacked taste.  It was not bad enough to not eat but was not very good.  \n\nAt the end of the meal we asked if there was anything they could do for us for the wait.  The waitress stated that she had already asked the manager and she had said no.  We then asked to talk to the manager and she said that she was sorry and she recognized that we had waited a very long time for our meal.  She stated that they were new and it was the computer/transition to breakfast and there was nothing they could do.  After a few more minutes of conversation, she agreed to comp us one meal.  \n\nI first recommend the manager reading the book Fred 2.0.  The customer experience is so important and even having to ask for something to be done due to the long wait fails to meet \""great customer service\"".  Being in the service industry myself, I would have comped the meal and given a free return meal so we could prove to the customer how great we normally are.  \n\nUnfortunately I will not be returning and will recommend to others to do the same...."
0,"Beautiful views of the city. New, clean, and \""hip.\"" \n\nThe opportunities? Train the staff and teach hospitality (perhaps this will be ironed out as the restaurant settles in... But any server worth his or her salt should know how to present and pour $150 bottle of wine). Food was solid but nothing to necessarily brag about. Rave reviews of the cuisine from the other restaurant in Cleveland can't quite yet be attributable to Charlotte. Most everything we received from the kitchen was cold or room temperature at best -so hard to make a good judgment on cuisine. I had the pork tenderloin but it was set atop a cold mushy serving of sweet potatoes so tough to taste the flavoring itself. The apps were tasty and salad was fresh. \n\nThe decor itself is interesting - the fluorescent lights scour the eyes and diminish the elegance. And last. Be prepared to valet your car at the Hyatt downstairs and pay for parking."
0,"People keep saying how this place has the best burgers. Well not so for veggie burgers. Seriously, Denny's veggie burger is better. The patty was dry bland mush."
1,"Hit the jackpot here in early December 2008. Didn't expect awesome sales pre-Christmas, but my boyfriend and I both walked out with a huge couple of bags.\n\n Awesome jeans, spring styles we had seen in our hometown (but were not in our size or were sold out) and a few other surprises. All 40% off, too?\n\nThe service was good, with clerks looking in the back for other sizes and offering opinions on certain items. One of the clerks said she had gotten in trouble for not applying the full discounts the day previous, so we checked our receipt for proper prices before we left, recommend you do too. \n\n I didn't expect it to be so great, but my boyfriend already wants to return on our next trip. I have a feeling it was just a fluke we got such a good deal, but I'm willing to go look again."
0,Highway robbery! Goodness this place is expensive! \n\nI'm used to plenty of grocery store options in Downtown Chicago and prices not much different away from Downtown. What's up with this place?\n\nI had to walk here to buy an array of fruits for an office I was contracting at. Almost $3 per apple! Not even organic. That's just bad business.
0,"I want to love this place so much.  I want to roll around nekkid with it.  But sadly I had a very disappointing experience there.  We lucked out and got a seat at the bar in the basement.  The basement is one of the coolest places to take a date in town. The atmosphere and wine did not disappoint.  I ordered their caesar salad with shrimp. When asked if I wanted it grilled or blackened, I chose grilled. Sadly when my salad arrived, the shrimp had been blackened and all moisture evaporated from them.  They were like chewy Stretch Armstrongs.  When I pointed this out to the bartender, she simply said, \""that's how it comes.'  I get that not everyone's tastes are the same.  But I cannot think of anyone who would have enjoyed gnawing on these poor little creatures who sat sadly in a bed of lettuce cores and stems.  The brie toast was amazing, so they are capable.\n\nI will only return for drinks and to soak up the atmosphere.  They SO need to fix the quality of their food or at least their service when something like this happens."
0,"This place is listed on http://www.queencityvegan.com/restaurants/ because we are vegan, obviously. I personally can't have gluten. We chose this place hoping to have some good luck and have a nice dinner as well as good service. When we walked in the host sat us, it took 15 minutes for our server, which looked like the only server to come over to help us and take our order. Meanwhile we were given water by the host. Because I have to have GF foods I asked what was GF on the menu. I was told that there was a special menu that was \""hidden\"" it took 15 minutes to receive it. Meanwhile we asked for hot tea, that came out before the menu but it was 10 minutes, he said that it was \""special tea\"" that's why it took so long. Now we decided it was okay to order, when I began to ask questions about the menu I was given a lot of negative attitude he was more concerned about the table behind him. My parter ordered spring rolls and I ordered a coconut soup, the spring rolls came out fine, although my soup came out in a metal bowl with a flame in the middle I asked to not have it in the bowl with the flame the person that brought it out tried to put the candle out on the table by putting a plate over it. This made the flame 10 times higher than it was before when he lifted up the plate almost burning me. I just had them take it back. Needless to say, awful food, awful service. We will not be going back, avoid this place!"
0,"Romano Kitchen Counter , hmm.\nCertainly not 7 in 7, as promoted when I ordered lunch. \nNormal service time for table service usually extended. The current promotion no better. I am extremely disappointed because I like the menu.  I can only question : are they understaffed?"

0,"Negative stars! Don't waste your time and money there. I was there this weekend and  I was very disappointed. I got bored and was close to walking out, and the only reason I didn't was because I paid a lot of money. They tried coping Medieval Times and it's just a big FAIL. My kid didn't even enjoy it . Medieval time is 100x times better. The only thing that got my attention was the fireworks and even then I didn't think it was all that. The acting was terrible. They did have dancers but after a while they got boring and lost all purpose. The food wasn't good and the waiter was a jerk, I asked him for straws and he threw them in my table.  First of all Vegas is not for kids, but if you do take them and want to have fun do something else.   Adults must be pretty drunk in order to enjoy this show."
1,"First off, I will let everyone know that this location is WAY BETTER than the Lindsay location. The atmosphere inside is 100% Southwestern. Lots of cool colors and they have booth seating UNLIKE the store atmosphere of the Lindsay Avenue location.\nNow, for the food. We had ordered the weekend special Pozole. $6.99. With awesome fry bread. When we ordered it, the manager came over to us (guy manager) and told us that they were out of Pozole because it had been a busy day and offered to make us fresh Pozole and also said if we would want a snack like Nachos and he would take care of it. That was very nice! He said we could have any meat we wanted. We chose Machaca ( dried shredded beef). It was a huge order. It had cheese, Machaca, guacamole, beans, sour cream and poco de gallo. It was DELICIOUS!  We of course wanted to save room for the Pozole so we boxed it up and ate the Pozole. It was Fresh and hot! Came with onion and cilantro mix. Was very good and we WILL return due to the food and great customer service. Thank you guy manager! It was appreciated. It was worth the wait for the Fresh Pozole"
0,"Maybe it was the time of day (afternoon) but something was very off today. The cheese plate arrived long after the entrees, my companion's bacon wrapped scallops seemed uncooked and raw.   The chicken schnitzel was fine.   Good beer and wine selection.  Slow service."
0,"This place kinda sux! My boyfriend & I only went because of an event taking place there...  The servers & hostesses to me seemed kinda rude, our waiter was ok, maybe because he was a dude? We ordered the chicken fried steak, which was way salty (maybe because the gravy?), the gravy was so-so, the mashed potatoes were kinda dry, the corn was overcooked, the cornbread was good. The women's restroom wasn't too clean either. (I don't mean the usual mes from having a busy night - I mean like eek-level) We both got upset stomachs after eating here too  & I don't have a sensitive stomach at all. Actually landed me indisposed in the bathroom for a day. The only thing on par was the beer, which was Bud Light in the bottle. I could see how this would be a fun place if you're going for an event however..."
0,"I have been a faithful customer of 4 Paws for two years now and that ends now.  The store has a lovely set up and is certainly higher end than your usual pet food and supply store.  I love the environment and set up of the place and it's fairly close to home so I've been okay paying more to get it there.  They are bit more expensive than their competition.  \n\nQuite simply, my Miniature Schnauzer, Reagan, has been on Wellness Senior since she was 1.  The breed has been so prone to pancreatitis that their food selection is very narrow.  \n\nMore to the point, when I went in to grab food last week, I couldn't find the Wellness.  I asked the girl behind the desk about it and she informed me in an extremely snoddy way that they no longer carry big box brands.  I felt as though I was being talked down to and that my $40/bag food was subpar to their market.  As you know, Wellness is not big box.  It's not your puppy chow or kibbles.  \n\nI was offended.  How this place can stay open with mindsets and attitudes like that, coupled with their above average pricing, is beyond me.\n\nI think this is my first 1 star."
0,"I recently bought my first motorcycle (a 2001 KTM Duke II) and found Bohn's when searching online for KTM dealers. I went in with the intention of buying a jacket, helmet and gloves. Their store is pretty nice inside, and they have a good selection of gear (mostly dirt-oriented though). \n\nI wasn't quite sure what I wanted, so I asked a lady for some assistance in picking out a helmet. She was helpful, and recommended a jacket that would be usable in different types of weather. However, a friend who was with me said he had a different type of jacket (which they also sold), and she commented that the \""hated\"" that jacket and that the liner was \""nothing more than a glorified garbage bag.\"" Ok...\n\nWe also talked to a guy at the register about a '96 KTM 300 MXC that my friend just bought, and asked a simple question about a clutch cable. The guy seemed totally disinterested and clueless, and I'm not really sure if he even knew what a clutch was. He ended the conversation by saying that my friend should just throw his bike away because it was so old. What!?\n\nEven after that, I still bought a jacket from them and ordered a helmet I liked that they had assured me would be in later that week. I then got a call from them a few days later saying that the helmet was no longer available, but that I could pick another style. I then just ordered the helmet online and went back the next day to get a refund.\n\nI wanted to like this place, but between the thinly-veiled insults and seemingly clueless repair staff, I don't think I'll ever return. Their prices and selection are pretty decent, so if you are in the area and know what you want, it might be OK to stop by and pick something up. If you have any alternative, though, I would avoid this place."

0,Its a scam!! They rise ur insurance rates without telling u claiming they can get a deal but all goes in there pocket the whole time ur paying...watch out az for all auto glass is the same...a lil crack cost u a thousand in fees!! Beware!!
0,Seating was atrocious.  Poor setup.  Chips were stale. Salas were good.. tacos were mushy.  Pork belly was not crispy.  Nice looking little place but would not recommend.
1,"the machine at this place \""malfunctioned\"" so our table got 10 margaritas for the price of one! so this place ain't gettin anything else from me lol"
1,"Kind of a pain to get to with the construction.  The guy taking the order seemed very inefficient and confused.  The Pilly Max cheesesteak was AMAZING.  I loved the bread and the gooey cheesey mushroomy steak on it.  I would order it next time with just cheese, mushroom and meat though as the other flavors got old as I was eating the huge thing.  Fresh brewed iced tea was a huge plus.  My kids shared a huge turkey and avocado sandwich.  They thought it was just okay, same with the fries.  We took it to go and it wasn't super fast but not to slow either."
1,"My first experience with STK was at the NYC location, and I was hardly surprised when they decided to bring an STK to my current digs in Los Angeles -- a city that has its fair share of trendy restaurants that lack culinary inspiration. Suffices to say I was less than shocked when I heard the Cosmopolitan hotel in Las Vegas would also feature an STK restaurant. \n\nMy experiences at all three locations have been markedly different. The NYC location boasted good food and a classy atmosphere in the Meatpacking District (an area which wasn't hurting for culinary hot-spots at the time) and was able to deliver consistently, even in its nascent stages (I moved out of NYC shortly after it opened so I wasn't able to see how the restaurant fared in the later stages of its existence). While the steaks left something to be desired, the restaurant was trendy and the overall experience was fun. I'll unabashedly add that, hands down, the best steaks still come from Texas. \n\nWhen the Los Angeles restaurant opened, I was happy to see that same ambiance maintained, but unfortunately, the food was inconsistent at best (definitely nothing to write home about) and it's \""trendiness\"" quickly declined within its first year. STK LA's biggest redeeming quality was (and still is) its proximity to other LA nightlife hotspots, and the location is enough to get me there with a group of friends for some cocktails and light appetizers to kick the night off. \n\nFast forward to 2011 and the latest trendy hotel in Vegas, the Cosmopolitan, now boasts its very own STK. A group of us made up of my closest friends from Texas, New York and California were staying at the hotel for the weekend to celebrate my birthday, so we decided to check out STK. I tried making a resie through the hotel but, annoyingly, the restaurant handles its own reservations and my call was promptly directed to their hostess. Getting a reservation was easy enough -- I called 4 days in advance of our arrival -- and we figured 9:30pm would be a good time to eat before an insanely late night of dancing. Our group of 4 arrived on time and the hostess informed us that the wait would be half an hour...with a reservation. Disgruntled, but determined not to let the unfortunate news spoil our mood, we proceeded to the bar to have some very expensive, very plain drinks -- if you are price-sensitive and like to imbibe, then this is not the restaurant for you. \n\n45 minutes later, we were seated and STARVING. This is when things got exponentially better. Our servers were incredibly fun, enthusiastic and attentive. Throughout the entire meal, our waitress helped us by making great recommendations, taking photos of us to help commemorate the trip, and showering us with an endless supply of complimentary birthday shots as well as a celebratory dessert plate, replete with delectable bite-sized cake and ice-cream lollipops. Crisis averted. Be sure to request Raquel M. as your server -- Raquel and her fellow cohorts will make sure you have a blast. The restaurant manager even let us explore the kitchen, meet the chef, observe the plating ritual and peruse all the fresh ingredients. The kitchen was very clean and well managed and the staff was very friendly. \n\nThe giant seafood platter we ordered was thoroughly enjoyed by everyone but me (I'm picky, obvi) --  the king crab was a little soggy for my taste and the oysters left me underwhelmed -- and the steaks were actually better than the ones I had at the NYC and LA locations. I ordered the ribeye medium rare and the cut and flavor were excellent. Still not on par with Texas steaks, but as far as the STK chain goes, I really enjoyed my meal.\n\nNet/net, while the steaks at STK restaurants are not my favorite, the ambiance is usually pretty fun and the staff at the Las Vegas location absolutely made this experience worthwhile. If you are staying at the Cosmopolitan and/or looking for a fun/trendy place to eat before you head to Marquee, this is the place to go."

1,"Sugar Factory!! I went to last vegas last year to go to SEMA with my Hubby, and as I was looking for places to shop in the miracle mile shop, I stumbled on this super cute candy store. Their specailty is I guess those couture lollipop, they are so cute but they are expensive, the price ranges from 22-30 per lollipop and they offer bundles that ranges from 30-80 so yah it is really expensive for a lolipop but hey if you're  the type of person that can splurge money on casionos and shows then maybe you'd want to get some of these cutesy lolipops\n\nAmbiance: very tourisy and cute\nPrice: $$ moderate but still really expensive for just a lolipop\nService: is ok, there is so much people in this store almost all the time that the associates can't attend to all of them, but it was not a big deal for me.\n\nWarning!!!!  place can get really crowded. So expect a line and a ton of kids and teens\n \nAs of me I give Sugar Factory 4 stars because I am a fan of their lolipop flavors and their super cute couture handles ^__^"
0,"This was the first time for me visiting this establishment.  It was busy because of the Transiberian Orchestra concert but there was not a wait to be seated. The first thing I did when I walked in was order a drink.  Stella Atrois $6.15 per draft.  Its a bit expensive, but being downtown and directly across from the Console Energy Center, I expected drinks to be a little on the expensive side.  \n\nAfter I was seated with my party, we were served bottles of water at the table.  I suspect tap water in reusable glass bottles.  After, it took quite a bit for our waitress to come back to take our order. My girlfriend and I started with the Poutine Appetizer.  Again, it took a long time for our food to arrive.  The app was pretty good, but for french fries, cheese and gravy, $10 was a bit on the expensive side.  But again, downtown restaurant so it was expected.  My girlfriend also ordered a glass of white wine.  It was served in a soaking wet glass.  And when she commented on that to the waitress and asked for a different glass, the waitress almost seemed annoyed. \n\nFor dinner, I ordered the Hangover Cure Sandwich with blue cheese, garlic fries.  My girlfriend had the crab cake entree.  It took almost 45 minutes for our entrees to arrive.  There were two crab cakes about the size of a hockey puck each  (no pun intended) and the cost was $27.  This time, I expected a little but more in the portion department for $27.  When my entree arrived, everything looked great but the waitress forgot my side of ranch dressing.  She then looked at me and said \""oh, I forgot your ranch dressing, Ill be right back with that\"".  Needless to say, she never brought it.  It also took forever for her to bring our check, pick them up, and return them.  It almost made my friends late for the concert.  At this point, the restaurant was dead, so being busy had nothing to do with the time it took our waitress to do her job.\n\nAll in all, I would not suggest this place.  There are a lot of other restaurants downtown (and just across the river on the south side) that are a lot better bang for your buck and a lot better service.  I will not be going back."

0,"The fiance was craving cheese steaks and our local burger/sandwich joint is closed on Sundays. So, we decided to try out DeFalco's. Reading the reviews, I saw that the wait time is sometimes an issue, so I called in our order in advance. The order consisted of 1 whole cheese steak w/ everything and 1 half w/ everything. \n \nUpon arrival, I was given the total of $21 and some change. Having seen the online menu with pricing, I was prepared for the bill to be somewhere around $15, so I was a little shocked when I was told it was over $20. I verified the order with the man and found that I was charged for and made one extra whole sandwich. I told the cashier that the order was incorrect, to which he said \""I was the one who took the phone order and it was for 2 whole and 1 half sandwiches.\"" He proceeded to grab the order slip and show me. I replied, \""Well, I'm the person who called in the order and specifically asked for 1 whole for my finance and 1 half for myself.\"" He stood there after my explanation as if expecting me to pay for the additional sandwich. After he realized that I was not going to pay for his mistake, he took the second whole sandwich back and rerang the bill. The new total came to $13.00+ tax, an amount within the range I was expecting to pay. \n \nEven though the sandwiches were delicious, we are hesitant to return. We may try DeFalco's again, only next time as walk-in customers"
0,"WAIT TIME IS TERRIBLE!!  $30 savings per the length of my trip to have to wait for the shuttle and then to wait in 3 separate lines is not worth it.\n\n1st, you have to take two shuttles to get to Fox Rent A Car.  First shuttle from Airport to Main Rental Car complex, then a separate shuffle service provided by FOX that takes you to their rent a car complex.  Their shuffle doesn't run very frequently and thus you may have to wait on arrival and during departure process.  \n\n2nd, when you arrive at their complex you have to wait in line at the front desk to do the typical paperwork and to pay for the car.  The workers work like they work at the DMV, very slow and frustrating.  There where about 10 customers in line, and there was 2 workers casually chatting on the side.  \n\n3rd, after you wait in line at the front desk to get your paper work straightened out, you have to wait in another line for another worker to pull up your car which may take 15-45 minutes depending on how many people are in front of you like at a valet stand.  During our visit, they only had one worker pulling up cars so the process took forever.  \n\n4th, when you get in your car, you have to pull to the exit gate where you have to wait in a 3rd line to have the exit attendant check you out.  \n\nDon't risk ruining your Las Vegas trip by booking with this company."
0,"My mother recently got married here & the wedding itself was super cute but lets get to the point of the two stars.....\n\nTHE PHOTOGRAPHY IS HORRIBLE.\nThey do not allow any of your guests attending to take pictures during the wedding so they can screw you over pretty much. The pictures they took were SO FAR AWAY the people in them look so tiny. Tons of the pictures had very high contrast too which made my mother look like a ghost OR they were so dark you can barley see some of the guests in group pictures! After complaining they said it'd be $70 an hour for someone to go through and crop them AFTER already purchasing prints. (Keep in mind we don't live in Nevada) After multiple more calls & complaints to the manager they finally agreed to take her pictures back and replace them with closer up photos for no charge BUT the woman helping, my mother described, as very rude and snotty about helping her. Not a great experience."
1,I've been going to McAuley Pediatrics for close to 9 years now. Both of my children like Dr. Collins as well as Dr. Gonzales. The office staff is friendly and will find ways to work you in if need be. \n\nAs a plus they're located right next to an evening only pediatric urgent care so if you can't make it during the day you can go right next door at night.
0,"This was my second visit attempting to use a $25.00 Restaurant.com certificate.  The first visit I realized that with plate prices between 9.50 and 12.50 that between two of us, we couldn't possibly meet the minimum purchase of $50.00.  My second attempt to use the $25.00 off was tonight with 3 friends.  We started off with an appetizer of Chicken Satay with peanut sauce and a cucumber salad.  YUM.  For entrees, Pad Thai, Pad Se Ew, Pad Wu Sen, and Squash Curry.  Very good, all of it.  The noodles on the Pad Se Ew were overdone, but OK.  The problem came with the billing.  The $25 off Restaurant.com certificate clearly stated that it was not valid on Saturdays.  Well, it was Friday night.  Our server said that the certificate was no good on weekends.  I clearly stated, showed her the highlighted exclusion for Saturdays, that it was Friday night, and that the exclusion is not for weekend nights...just Saturday.  She understood, and asked her co-worker to explain to us that the coupon isn't good on weekends.  I again said, it is Friday.  It's no good on Saturday.  She left, talked to a cook who hollered at her and nobody came back to talk to us and re-explain why the certificate was no good.  We left the full balance of the bill, plus generous tip, but will not go back.  It was very frustrating."
0,"A big WHA WHA!\n\nDidn't wait long because I was with a group of 6 girls but then found it was a $20 cover.  Since it was late, we decided to screw it, but as we were walking out, got handed free passes, so we turned around and went back in.\n\nAwesome interior, but the point of a nightclub is to dance. You can't dance if you're wedged up against 600 other sweaty, wasted people. I don't care how good you look coming in, you're gonna look nasty if you're sweaty and wasted regardless.\n\nI can imagine if you're really tore up however, it might be a strategic move to shove your way in to the middle of the crowd, since it's virtually impossible to fall down with all those people holding you up.\n\nAlso, those girls in the pools are really depressing. When nice girls say hello and ask you how you're doing and you stare blankly ahead and strike a pose from a foot away, you look like you've been trafficked. Either that or you just have to get wasted to make it through your shift."
1,"Have always been a fan. My go-to whenever I go to eat dinner with a family member or friend, and now my go-to whenever I come back to visit. I like the one by Hilldale Mall a lot better than the one on the Capitol Square because there's a lot more space. \n\nComfort food is what you'll find here...and comfort in general - you'll get more comfortable with the more beers you try. :)\n\nMy favorite dishes are the meat loaf and the smothered and covered chicken. (both fairly salty by the way - but the good salty...the kind of salty that makes sense). And if I'm feeling ambitious, the beer sampler. Sometimes it's a hit or miss with the meat loaf - most of the times I've ordered it it's been perfect and juicy. A few times it was a little dry, but just let them know and they fix it for you - how they fix it I do not know...."
0,"We went here because of the mass reviews on Yelp. Let me just say that the reasons why this place is getting a one star is because the bad service we got from our server Efrain M. He made us feel comfortable at all! There was no Hello, how are you, just grumpy what do you want kind of attitude. I used to waiter but even on my bad day, I would leave all that at the door. We ordered the Ahi Tuna Burger and The Prime Steak Sandwich (which was pretty much the only thing that cheer me up) the Scallops felt like it was a couple days old, and the Seafood Crepe was not very apetizing. Seafood tasted smelly and old! The Chicken Bri Sandwich looks like they pilled a bunch of S on it. But worst of all, this place is so OVERATED! Don't go here unless you want to eat mostly SH***Y food and crappy service. Stay AWAY!!!"
1,"Wow.  Just... wow.\n\nLocated in an old 19th century farm house in semi-rural Conestoga, Rumbletum might be the nicest looking, coziest cafe / gift shop I've ever set foot in anywhere on the planet.  I went there for a boardgame event with 25 other geeks... most of these geeks are used to playing games in less-than-beautiful surroundings, and really don't care about a venue's appearance.  Still, many of them were simply blown away by Rumbletum.\n\nThe owners, Quinn and Heidi, are friendly and personable, the sort that want to see you happy.  This is a refreshing change from the jaded, stand-offish service I'm becoming accustomed to in many Toronto shops.  \n\nIt is mostly Heidi's shop -- Quinn contributes boardgame goodness at deeply discounted prices -- and her background as a graphic artist really shines through, from the meticulously scripted chalkboard menus to the quaint and quirky bathroom product display... in an actual bathroom.\n\nIt's difficult for me to really classify Rumbletum in terms of its gift offerings, but home decor and art really seem to be the focus, with all manner of eclectic giftware to be found in nooks and crannies throughout the house.  This really is a shopping experience, where you can completely lose track of both time and purpose as you poke about and marvel at all the little goodies there are to find.\n\nAs for the cafe side of things, damned if they don't make an assortment of ridiculously tasty grilled sandwiches (the veggie is divine!  $7ish as I recall), some killer chocolate chip cookies (85cents!), and a rather nice cup of java (with lots of choices that range from about $2-$4).  \n\nI didn't sample their other baked goods, but they looked rather epic -- the cakes in particular were begging to make me fat again.  Finally, they offer up loose leaf teas, a seasonal soup, milk shakes, smoothies, and ice cream to round out a focused, comforting menu that ties nicely to the space itself.  It's kind of like eating in your slightly oddball aunt's old house -- if your aunt was a graphic artist wanting to sell you amusingly offensive silk-screened toilet paper.\n\nIn any case, I'll sum up Rumbletum thusly:\n\n1)  Gorgeous.\n2)  Tasty sandwiches and a good cup of joe.\n3)  Easy to spend two hours poking about a really cool boutique.\n4)  Local flavour and cool people.\n5)  Boardgames for sale.  Criminally cheap.\n\n5 stars.  I was blown away."
0,"Beware! I struggled down to this location first thing Sunday morning after calling them at 4 am and being told to just show up when the doors opened at 8. I was seen right away and I explained I had an infected tooth that was spreading throughout my face and throat and it was the most pain of my life! My dentist was not open till that Monday and i didn't know what to do. The doctor left the room and then very unprofessionally complained to someone in the hallway AND within earshot, how he wasn't a damn dentist and he would be looking it up on the Internet. He returned with a prescription for Tylenol and low dose antibiotics. All to the wasted tune of around $150.00... After 8 hours of absolute agony I called to explain that things were much worse. I was instructed to come back in so with what little physical power I could muster I did. When I arrived I was immediately turned away and the doctor refused to even view me. I got the impression they thought I was \""drug seeking\""? In fact, I was more interested in better antibiotics than pain meds in the 1st place, but that was kind of hard to convey with a face swollen to twice it's original size. I have now been in the hospital for 2 days and the infection almost reached my brain and it's possible I could have died. Nextcare urgent care is a take your money and spit you back out kind of place. My advice to the people working there is to decide what it is you would like to do for a living and then go and do that thing. Healthcare providers you are not. My advice for people in need of healthcare... Wait for the people working there to take that advice and when they leave maybe you'll get some much needed help!"
0,"I can't review the food, because we wound up getting up and leaving when they refused our Groupon, telling us they no longer were honoring them, even though they still have one currently for sale on the Groupon site. There was no way we were going to stay and eat there, when they knew we'd paid for the Groupon, and were not upright enough to take it (it is a valid Groupon, not expired). There was one other couple in the whole, unappealing looking place at 6PM on a Friday night. I'd guess they're not doing well, and with this attitude, I can see why. People buy Groupons to try out a place to see if they'll go back, and we were looking for a good Indian restaurant closer to our home than Jewel in the Crown. This will not be it."

1,"We eat at a lot of Indian buffets for lunch and we think this is a really, good one.  The weekday lunch buffet is $7.99 (I think) and includes tea.  Lots of options, really tasty.  Very friendly service."
1,"Great place for cocktails or grabbing a casual bite to eat. Cool atmosphere and anywhere they light drinks on fire is fine by me. I got wine this time around but they were mixing up all sorts of crazy cocktails at the bar (burning wood chips over bourbon, you know the fancy stuff). Extensive beer selection. Our food selections turned out amazing. We started with fries topped with pot roast and gravy. Then, I got a burger (covered with goat cheese, mushrooms, caramelized onions & arugula) with a side salad. Clearly, I wasn't making healthy choices that evening but it was well worth it.\n\nWill be going back soon!"
1,"I was very pleasantly surprised when I walked in. I guess I wasn't expecting a nice sit down restaurant. It exceeded my expectations in that regard. The server was great. Very attentive. The Palermo pizza was amazing. Buttery great crust, lots of cheese. The Sicilian pizza was very over cooked. The crust was harder and the toppings were chewy and hard. I would get the first pizza again and will be back to try more stuff. Great restaurant."
1,It isn't in the best neighborhood but they do a really great job on my eyebrows. I am SUPER picky about them so it's rare for me to like a place this much. I won't go anywhere else! Only $8 too!
0,"I love the concept of Container Park, but the execution not so much.  They do succeed at bringing diverse groups of people together in a common area.  Comes complete with screaming kids everywhere though.  My biggest gripe is that important details were overlooked in the planning phase. \n\nThe live music stage is a very nice touch.  All of the dining options require customers to order from a window instead of table service.  All of the dining places had long lines for food.  Bars had long wait times and seating is minimal.\n\nFor people with young children, this is an ideal spot to take family.  The kiddos can play on the giant playground in the middle or run and whack each other with foam blocks on the stageside lawn."
0,"I've been to CR a few times now since I like to venture out of my usual latte spots... usually a decent experience... This time, however, I had several disappointments that altered how I perceive this place (and ultimately alter my desire to come back again).  \n\nThis particular evening, my sister and I arrived and, though we weren't planning on staying and hanging out (I just wanted a latte), after what we experienced, we decided to leave quickly.  \n\nThe place has a nice, local hang-out feel to it - lots of random people, in groups, or on laptops, just chillin' enjoying their drinks.. the staff was friendly and all, too.  When I went to order my latte, I had a few questions on steam temperature for my milk (I'm slightly picky about that) and he kindly answered them and executed my shots as requested.  As I was paying (cash, since they only allow debit/CC cards at a minimum of I think $5), he asked if we were going to stay there for the evening or just to-go.. me, total optimist, thinking he is going to offer us the wifi password or even a sample of something or just plain being friendly and talkative, was surprised when he said \""yeah, because you have an outside drink and we don't allow those, so you'd have to leave\"" adding a fake sorry face... my sister, next to me, holding her Starbucks water container filled with WATER... I'm thinking \""really??? are you serious??\"" I was super surprised at that statement and frankly, really annoyed.  I just bought a product and am being told that because she has a Starbucks CUP (not even a Starbucks coffee), she has to leave.  WTF!\nYou can tell that totally did not sit well with me.  We kindly said we'd leave as we were going to go shopping anyway... \n\nTHEN, as I go to shake the nutmeg and the cinnamon in to my latte (this is how I fake myself out that my latte is sweet without the extra sugar), I shake and shake and the flippin' spices come mixed with SUGAR - both nutmeg AND cinnamon... what's the point?  There were already 3 different kinds of sweeteners there on the shelf for ppl to add as they please, why do they have to add sugar to the cinnamon and nutmeg shakers?.. I found that annoying and definitely a con to getting lattes at this place.\n\nall in all, I'm not sure I'll come back soon.. maybe not for a while.. or ever.  Sorry, but I've experienced better."
0,"To whom it may concern,\n\n\nI have recently stayed at the Venetian for my 21st birthday. Their customer service was terrible. First, I arrived into my suite and did not realize that there was a sign on the fridge that mentions that we get charged if the beverages were removed. I removed it without knowing and put my own beverages into the fridge. Then I realized that I would have gotten charged I immediately called the front desk and they offered to send someone in to check the fridge to make sure that nothing was opened and to waive the fee if nothing was opened. The following day  I was still concerned on if anyone has shown up to see the refreshments and I called the front desk again to ask for someone to come up to check.  Also, there were many things broken in the room and a repair man came to help fix them so we could avoid and charges happening after our stay. My boyfriend was inside the hotel room all day and did not see anyone come to check our refreshments. We made another call and a person at front desk said that they will just waive the fee for us. We were not informed anything about refreshment \""restocking\"" fee.  On Sunday morning we called for more blankets and pillows at 5:48am and still did not get them until I finally tired of waiting for them until 6:45am outside my room. I went down to the front desk and tried to get them myself and finally around 7am pillows and blankets were sent to our room. Finally, Sunday afternoon someone has come up to our hotel room to check the refreshments. This was a very misleading situation because we were informed that our refreshment fees got waived. We were really confused because we have been informed that it has been taken care of. I have talked to many front desks employees and managers that were informing us that the refreshment fees would be taken care off. I am really upset with the customer service that I have dealt with this past weekend. I left to come back home still feeling unsure about the refreshment situation and my bill. I called today to try to find out how much I was billed and the front desk did not want to help me and said that they would just email me my receipt and tried getting me off the phone not answering my question. Then I have called the Venetian again and spoke to a male front desk person and explaining him the situation about the refreshments and informing him that there were the repair man and the front desk person reassuring us that we would get our refreshments fees waived. He was very understanding about our situation, but wanted to run through the manager. At first the manager stated that I was informed many times about the $50 restocking refreshment fee, but that is totally false. They argued that they have it on their notes that I was informed. Then they tried to say that I stated that I had the drinks in the bathroom. I have meant that the drinks were my own beverages in the bathroom. I am very upset with the way Laurie/Lauren the manager that refused to waive the charged and hung up on me when I asked I wanted the person's name that made the note that was informed because I wanted to get them fired. What kind of service is this? I had to call back and ask for her again and tried to get compensation, but she insisted that she was not going to waive the fee and that was that. I am very upset with the Venetian and the way they handles their customers with their policy and their miscommunications. I want to request if there are any taped recordings of my phone calls with the front desk because the manager I had spoken with had claimed that I was notified on every conversation concerning this matter and claimed that I had made statements that allegedly admitted \""facts\"" that I had never said and the contradictory reasoning that was used to deny our claim.  This experience has been a complete disappointment to me and my guests.  I have never been this upset to make a formal complaint, but based on this experience, I will be making sure that neither myself nor anyone that I know will ever be staying at this disgraceful hotel again."
0,Horrible drive thru! I waited 10 mins after i paid before they told me the fryer was not on and they were unable to service me.
1,"If eating 36 ounces of froyo would not be classified as gluttenous, I would have filled 3 cups all the way to the top and totally justified the calories.  (Which I feel fine about because it's like 100 calories for 4 ounces... wait why am I talking about calories?)\n\nMy friend, Jamie, told me to try Yogurtology last week while we were eating at another frozen yogurt place.  She claimed it was the BEST frozen yogurt.  Jamie, I hope you read this because YOU WERE RIGHT!\n\nYogurtology's yogurt is the best I have ever had.  I feel a little sad that my cup is empty and I'm left dreaming about it."
1,Lots of study space and the coffee was great!   Recommend the french press... the carafe is enough to keep you going all night!!
0,"If there's a zero, I would've given that. Sh*ttiest place ever. An 8 in veggie pizza took FOREVER to order. Never will I ever set foot on here again."
1,"I have had dogs my entire life so I've been to my fair share of vets. Dr. Montana is the first vet I have ever been to where I felt he was completely honest and not looking to nickel and dime with various diagnostics that wouldn't really affect the type of treatment we would choose. When my dog of 14 years was diagnosed with lymphoma, Dr. Montana called me at home with the results and gave me all my options and really talked me through what was devastating diagnosis.  When we decided not to do chemo and just keep my boy happy for his time left with us, Dr. Montana actually made me feel so at peace with our decision. The staff at West Olive is also so caring and very accommodating. Many times I have called and they tell me they can get me in that day. They truly care about my dogs and I will recommend Dr. Montana and his staff to ANYONE!!!"
1,"firstly, this place has a great vibe -- cool exposed ductwork & brick, reclaimed wood behind the bar, and a clean separation between the bar & main dining area.\n\nsecondly, the staff was super-helpful and nice.  richie was totally spot-on behind the bar and made it a point to introduce himself to us, show us the menus (even though we weren't eating and just wanted to creep on it), and explain the drinks to us.\n\nthirdly, the joint carries both local & other domestic quality beers on-tap (bell's, east end brewery).  and, the moscow mule?!  goddamn delicious.  comes in one of five frigid copper cups (richie told us these are $30/piece -- so, if you're gonna drink one of these at the bar, they want either your CC or driver's license so they don't disappear), tastes like ginger, and is full of delicious booze with no taste of it!!!\n\ncan't wait to go back and try the food, including both styles of beets (is that weird?!)...and hopefully give the fifth star!"
1,"By far the best mexican food in Las Vegas, I've been coming here since 1998 and still go at least once a month, we get treated like family even when their slammed busy. 1 drink will put you on your ass, great service and amazing flavor. love their tamles yummm!!!"
1,"We came on a mellow Sunday morning with the full intent of having a breakfast and then some dessert.\n\nThis was definitely a Willy Wonka experience for adults...though, with less of the fat German kid drinking from the fake brown water river that was supposed to be chocolate and more of a dessert wonderland feeling.\n\nIt was sort of dead which I guess always puts a damper on the whole experience but things did pick up.  Inexplicably, they offered us a table behind the exterior menu board so we ate constantly with a shadow over us.  And I'm pretty sure we photobombed a bunch of people taking their pics with the menu board.\n\nIt took a while to decide but I ordered a dark hot chocolate in their adorable hug mug and their scramble (one of the few savory breakfast items they have on their menu) while hubby went with their Illegal Chocolate Chocolate Chocolate Pancakes.\n\nOur food was pretty darn awesome.  My scramble came with a large piece of baguette and along side it, a little crock each of butter and chocolate.  FOR MY PIECE OF BAGUETTE.  How sinful is that??  I'm not going to lie - butter and choco sauce on bread is to die for.  Wow.  \n\nHubby's pancakes were also probably (we both agreed but he said it first because he took the first few bites) the best pancakes we'd ever had.  It was topped with fried bananas and served with a white chocolate and milk chocolate sauce.  The pancakes didn't appear chocolately but they were still delicious.  \n\nIn the end, we skipped dessert because hubby's pancakes were dessert enough (I had about 1/4 of that bad boy).  Service was nice and perfectly attentive."
0,"To begin-knew it was going to be expensive dinner, but was in Vegas for my sister's b-day.  Reservations made by our Hotel Concierge, who shared that info, tho did not know until we came and the hostess acknowledged it.  We  were immediately seated. Now mind you, been to Milo's in NY, (the waiter asked if we were familiar with the restaurant-said yes) so of course, expected the same service/food as NYC. Surprise, not a chance!  Service wasn't bad, but but far from excellent. Perhaps because we did not want to pick out our fish, the waiter was put off but we were fine with him doing it.  \n\nOrdered: Fried eggplant/yogurt good, have had better.  Med bass--did not do a good job de-boning, but had flavor-once you took the bones out of your mouth.  Did not ask if we wanted coffee or dessert.  \n\nWhen I asked for the check, the first waiter turned to my sister to wish her a happy b-day, when I paid, the other server acknowledged it.  You knew and did nothing to make it an experience?! Perhaps checking how the food or engaging us would also been nice  But since we were not there for a convention or other business reasons, (it was a week night, do not believe patrons were leisure travelers) perhaps they figured they'd never see us again. \n\nTold friends and colleagues our experience--and as one person said--Vegas makes its money on the hospitality industry, the people who work there just are not hospitable!  Did not find it in any of the other restaurants we ate at. But certainly did at Milo's!  And when we left, no one said good night or thanked us!\n\nJust a thought--don't take your guests for granted!"
0,Me and my coworkers thought that this was a YC's location.... as it was not!!!! Presentation to me sells everything and this placed looked like a 80's retro theme on accident!!!!
1,Walmart is always the best. Set up a little different then most I've been too but easy to find your way around and get lost just looking. Parking is the worst during the day heads up.
1,"Great Tasty Burger!!!  Different and interesting topping combinations, toppings/sides that really take your taste buds on a delicious trip.  I got the Hangover Burger.  Could not say one bad thing about it, and it was so good I ate the onions which I have always taken off on other burgers.  Highly recommend."
1,"What a difference a month makes. A month ago I left a bad review after a culmination of several visits/experiences - Ale Asylum's response to my concerns were swift and immediate - I received contact from Hathaway and Jillian. They took time to listen and even referred me to Otto, co-owner, who asked me to visit with him. Their collective concern was genuine and meaningful. I was impressed and grateful that my comments and concerns were invited and respected. Yesterday we stopped for a mid-afternoon sandwich, served at the bar. The welcoming and charismatic attitude was infectious from the start. It was nice to see staff and patrons enjoying themselves, the great beer, and excellent food - served with enthusiasm and genuine interest. Kudo's to Hathaway, Jillian, Otto and everyone at Ale Asylum - the beer you create is something Madison and Wisconsin can be proud of, your food has always been creative and tasty, and yesterday your staff made visiting Ale Asylum fun again. Thank you. I look forward to visiting again soon. Take a few minutes to visit Aly Asylum and enjoy the experience - I believe you will. Ask about the new brewery tour."
0,"Went here to watch the World Cup 2014.\nService?  There was none.  Complete and utter failure.\nWe actually tried to go to see the US match, but was turned away because we didn't make reservations.  That was fine.  \nThis time we had reserved a table, but it didn't matter because the staff was completely unprepared for the event.   Kind of crazy since they are known to be a soccer viewing sports bar.  Rather disappointing."
0,"Took my kids here to hang out on one fine 72 degree sunny Saturday in February. Going over the bridge, coming from Aliante Casino, you cant miss the nice view of the waterfall that is at the forefront of the park.\n\nToo bad this and the playground were the only nice things I can vouch for. \n\nThe playground is a nice fenced in little area that has a decent amount of playground equipment, swings, slides, tables, and benches. I like the soft material they use that the playground equipment is built on. There is also a sand lot area that has dinosaur bones as props. The day we went, the playground was packed. Kids were running into each other as they went down the slides. There were kids actually waiting to get on the swings! \n\nAfter a while we decided to walk around to check out the rest of the park. We see ducks everywhere especially in the pond that has the nice waterfall going into it. Unfortunately, this is where the \""nice stuff\"" ends. Everywhere on the paths we were walking on were green duck crap. Which brings the question, \""Is there some kind of spray or force field they have on the playground?\"" Because there were no ducks or green duck crap anywhere in the playground. Im also curious as to how many people would actually spread out a blanket and have a picnic on the grass for the crap was all over that as well. Just doing this review im starting to get grossed out thinking about that day.\n\nAfter carefully trying not to step on any crap going to the car, I made a mental note to make sure to mention all the green crap I saw in this review and to not hesitate in mentioning it to everybody I know that is either making plans on coming here or are just thinking about it. The only thing positive I can think of about that is to come here if you are on a diet. After seeing all the green crap, you probably wont be having much of an appetite and you definitely will get some exercise trying to avoid stepping on the stuff. \n\nSo, yeah, im not worried about coming back to this place any time soon in this lifetime. (You think?). Lol. Maybe as a duck."
0,"If you're into lots of sexual innuendos and cheesy dances and songs, then this is the show for you! If you have kids, I don't recommend bringing them here unless they're too young to remember anything. Other than that, it's a show with lots of sexy women and men without shirts, typical of the Las Vegas scene. Seeing it once is enough for me! The only cool thing about it was the blown up frog balloon on top of one of the restaurants."
1,This place is fantastic!!!  Best pizza I've had in a long time and the meatballs are to die for=)
0,"As far as retail centres come, this is not the best. None of the shops seem to have much of a pull to take you away from the high street unless you live quite locally to the area.\nI did go there to TK Maxx, but only because a friend wanted some company, I personally wouldn't be attracted to go there on my own as the shops really aren't that impressive and the entertainment on offer, a bingo hall is not exactly my definition of a good night.  \nI feel that there is a need to get some more upmarket restaurants there to attract more people there, as the KFC really wouldn't add to the relief of some retail therapy.\nI would only go to Meadowbank Centre for the food shopping facilities there rather than the other shops."
1,"\"" my review is subjective\""\n\nMy group tried a little of everything.\n\nReasonable PRICES\n\nCountry Benedict         4.5 Stars\nI have no complaints on this twist of an original. It was delicious combination of Eggs Benedict with biscuits and sausage and gravy and seasoned salt country potatoes!! I loved it all, nothing was left on my plate.\n\nBasically this place is known for their variation on  homemade pancake batters. \nIf you come here you have a to at least have a short stack. We wanted to try them all. But instead choose these three.\n\nRed Velvet short stack  5 stars\nPeanut Butter and Banana short stack 5 stars\nHazel Nut short stack 4 stars\n\nI will definitely come back here when I visit Vegas again. That's a given."
1,"oh love...\n\nthe meal starts with an \""amuse\"" of triple fries courtesy of the chef.. and boy they are all delicious and i wanted more at the end.\n\nour table ordered the ribeye, filet mignon and the kansas city. the filet was delicious but the ribeye was amazing.\n\nwe also ordered the scalloped potatoes for the table. really delicious but very heavy.. one or two bites will make your heart melt.\n\nfor dessert they had a mini donut special with dark chocolate and carmel sauce that was divine. ill be back here when im in vegas again!"
1,I had about 15 people with me for work. This place we dressed to the 9's and enjoyed every moment of it. It felt old school classic with a modern twist in my eyes. I absolutely loved it .. Umm surf and turf with upgrades I thinks so. Lobster mac and cheese ... Salivating hold on...\n\nHad a great time fantastic wait staff and amazing food. Try it. It's expensive but we all deserve a delicious expensive celebratory type meal.
1,"I went here for a work holiday party.  We had rented out the whole space, so I can't comment like the below people did on the normal crowd or decor, but for a holiday party, it was awfully nice. \n\nThey had waiters walking around with appetizers as well as a table stuffed full of interesting items - chicken curry and date kabobs, black bean dip on homemade tortilla chips, pot roast brushetta (a personal favorite), tiny crab cakes which were very tasty and scallops which were the worst of all the things I tasted.  They were definitely frozen and kind of cold. \n\nOf the champagne cocktails, I had two and was really pleased.  I had the Perle 75 which is served with St Germain's elderflower liquor, gin, cucumber, lemon and champagne.  It was refreshing and I don't say that I am a gin drinker.  The other was the Rose Bud - st germain's again, grapefruit juice and rose champagne.  It was very pretty and very tasty.  \n\nIt's not the type of place that I would normally go - I am more of a beer drinker or a classic cocktail - but it was interesting.\n\nI kept checking out the LED's that people seemed very bothered by in other reviews.  Personally, I thought they were festive.  There were also circles of LED's on the ceiling that were very pleasing.  And like most of the other reviews, the wait staff was immensely attentive and very friendly."
0,"THEFT ALERT: \nWe just found out that thousands of dollars in tools that were stored in a 400 lb, thick steel box and secured to a trailer with kryptonite locks were stolen at this storage facility. We have been told the \""manager\"" will not be available until March 6 or 7th and that they are not responsible for the theft. Sadly this wasn't a quick theft as it must have taken a good amount of time to get this 400lb box off the trailer. The Store More website claims a very secure facility as well as surveillance monitors. According to the employee \""there are no cameras in that area\"". The loss of our items doesn't appear to be much of a concern to this company which is why I will be doing my best to make sure everyone in the Queen Creek area is aware of this situation. We understand that Store More can't be responsible for every theft, however the website should not say this is a secure facility with surveillance cameras if there aren't any. We are very disappointed not only about the lack of security but by how we were treated."
1,"Real Donuts are the real deal. One of the best in the valley. The basic glaze donut is spectacular. Everything else I have tried has been quite good as well. They have mastered the art of not having dry donuts in the desert. With the apple fritters and the cake donuts the exterior has a nice light crunch with a slightly moist, yet fluffy interior. Staff behind the counter is always cool too. Why settle for grocery store nuts of the dough when you can indulge in these tasty fried delights?"
1,"We just landed from kc, we were hungry and wet from the rain.  A 20 minute wait and a good table, my birthday got brighter.  The bacon was extra crispy and the orange juice had bits of real orange.  Service was quick and organized.  The place is small, but clean & bright.  If you are ever there when they have the three meat scramble with eggs, spicy peppers & cheese- get it!  My partner ordered this & I had food envy."

0,"This place used to be my favorite on the strip! We used to go for cheap drinks and foot-long $1.99 hotdogs. And now its been replaced by Nathans unimpressive dogs :/ They swapped out a lot of slots for Arcade games, which is decent, but I'm just generally disappointed in the changes."

1,"we steamrolled through here on our road trip.  we were staying at the sheraton across the street and the concierge suggested we check it out.  good suggestion, because it was ladies night.  it was kind of dead when we first got there.  either it really did fill up, or all the alcohol we had made it seem more full.  we ended up having a really great time- girls dancing on bars, learning the cupid shuffle, stumbling through the electric slide.  we may have been a two man crew, but i think we brought so much party in our pants, the buckhead wouldn't have known what to do with more than two of us."
0,"The food is really delicious but the cleanliness is the issue.  The plates are always filthy, the tea pots are always gross, the silverware always have left over food.  I have talked to Brenda (the owner) about this issue and she just states that the dishwasher makes the marks on the plates, I then preceded to ask her when was the last time she purchased them and she rolled her eyes and literally went to go sleep behind the booth next to the glass windows of the party room.    It is unfortunate because of the quality of the food this place only gets two stars.  But if you can ignore the disgust of the restaurant and the dirt literally on the tree as you walk in ASK FOR JOHN AS YOUR SERVER, he is always good at conversation he knows how to hype up a plate.  \n\nBUT ALWAYS MAKE SURE YOU ARE EATING OFF OF A CLEAN PLATE AND WATCH HOW THEY HANDLE YOUR FOOD AND UTENSILS!!!!"
1,"My buddy and I were leaving back to LA and we wanted to try a new place off the Vegas strip so we drove down Sahara and stumbled upon the Vegas Grille. I sincerely mean it when I say that this is the best BBQ I have ever had! Staff was friendly and food was great and reasonably priced! In my opinion, it definitely beats all the fancy expensive BBQ restaurants!"
1,"This is a Charlotte treasure. Incredible menu, that can be a little overwhelming, but take your server's suggestions. Everything I've had here is delicious. They make same-day reservations only, so be sure to call ahead. Otherwise, you will be waiting..."

0,"Caveat Emptor!!! Just found out that they added $9.99 fee for insurance that I didn't ask for ($6.99 and $3.00 for 2 services!!) and declined when I upgraded to Iphone 5. I know that I didn't ask for it and declined it because I never buy insurance for anything that I buy. I cannot even remember someone talking to me about phone locator service, totally not  aware that they do offer this feature. I remember reviewing my bill to make sure that I am keeping my old plan and that my payment will not change. Poor customer service, felt like I got scammed! For those who are upgrading, make sure to check the breakdown of that very first bill after upgrading. Caught it early to get my account credited.."
1,"I had suffered with bad looking and poor fitting dentures for years. I was referred to Dr.Ladd and from the time I walked through the door, I was met by the most informative and friendliest staff I have ever had the pleasure of meeting. Dr. Ladd was very thorough in walking me through all the options and procedures that were offered to me.I now have great fitting and awesome looking dentures! My experience with Dr. Ladd and his wonderful staff has been a pleasure.I now have some amazing new friends, and most of all----I have my smile back!"
0,"F- for this establishment. I didn't even want to put a star, but system wouldn't allow me to post without one. Antiquated dryers that don't dry your clothes. Dryers are possessed,  they need an exorcism. They turn on and off by themselves. The owner of the place, the guy with the dogs,  said to me that the dryers are a different model. Stinking liar, there isn't a dryer in the world that does that! I'll be straight up with you folks,  save your quarters and go elsewhere,  because I am never going back there again. I will call the Better Business Bureau in the morning to report theft because they're stealing from their customers on dryers that are older than dirt and do not work properly.  Joanne Davie"
0,"This is my first review in Yelp. I have to tell everyone my experience.\n\nFood quality:\nTo be honest, the oysters was acceptable( but the size was super small). \nThe raw fish sucked. The quality was like the bargain sale item in supermarket. Not fresh. I doubt the fish is not for sashimi. \nThe uni: I witnessed  the chef ask the helper inside the kitchen to exchange the display window uni when we ordered uni sashimi. errr...\nWe also order grill yellowtail head. My piece of head had over 60% \""dark\"" area. (I noticed that the same item he serve to the other \""Japanese\"" looks nice.)\nSoft shell crab: frozen, oilly and covered with super much powder. \nUnagi: small, dry. \nThe most important part of a nigiri: rice. Don't order nigiri! The chef doesn't want to make it since he DOES NOT KNOW how to make. The ratio of the fish and rice is doesn't make any sense. Super much rice with thin fish. I know the fish was not that fresh. What about the rice? I agree that the rice itself is good, but not for sushi. You cannot hold the rice with chopsticks! Once you touch the rice, it fall down. \n\nMy story:\nI went there around 10:00pm since I yelped that there is discount for girl after 10:00pm. The restaurant is small and old (They have no table. You have to sit on the bar that face to face with the chef). There was only two other parties in the restaurant. My gf and I got a seat quickly and started order. The food on their menu (a piece of paper) are very limited. We filled in the order sheet. I passed it to one of the waitress. She asked me to order with the chef directly. Okay, I gave the order sheet to the chef (a \""true\"" Japanese man, I'll tell you why). He first refused to get that sheet because he want us to order verbally. But We don't want to read every order out one by one like an idiot. I explained to  him that it is too much to read.(I don't think he could memorize everything tought.) He finally got the sheet. He asked me if I want the sashimi or nigiri. I said nigiri. I asked him if they have Toro. He asked me to go to somewhere cross the street. That Japanese chef said we are difficult to serve in Japanese. And he was making fun of us with the other customers(they all speak Japanese.) My gf and I spoke English all the time, I think that chef must thought that we don't understand Japanese. I acted like I don't understand Japanese. He kept speaking Japanese to us and joking around with the others who speak Japanese. He was complaining us in front of us! Okay, I keep silence because we were so hungry, we don't want to go to another place. We waited for like 15 mins. During that time, the others kept ordering food in Japanese. Yes, they ordered late, their food came first! We had nothing to eat, not even a piece of sushi! Then I ordered some sashimi and oysters because I think that kind of raw food might come faster. I was right. The Japanese chef didn't want to make nigiri. If you order sashimi, he will serve it very fast. We quickly finished some \""can-eat\"" item. We left. Two hour after that, we were both in the restroom of the hotel. Which part did I spend most time in the hotel? Restroom!\n\nPS: I highly recommend this restaurant to Japanese. (Or you speak good Japanese)"
0,"Decent daily HH, but food quality was lower and prices higher than expected. Service was dismal at best. Convenient to my 'hood but can't see myself returning, not sure how they have so many locations unless this was out of the norm for them.\n\nOne waitress for whole place, but only three tables. Still barely saw her and had a mistake on our order. It was fixed and she was polite but not particularly attentive. When not serving she was seated at the bar watching a screen and drinking from a mug, maybe she wasn't feeling well.\n\nMenu describes wings using the word \""giant\"" but I found them quite small- one in the bucket was literally the size of my car key. Medium buffalo sauce was spot-on, regular and curly fries are both tasty. Standard bar fare, really.\nWebsite menu lists a November special of soup and sandwich, but those specials were nowhere to be seen on in-store materials. Luckily they still had it, because the potato soup is actually really, really good!"
1,"The husband came here on our wedding day to get his hair cut. They took great care of him and used shears so he wouldn't look like ...well like he got a haircut on him wedding day.\n\nEveryone here is great and while I sit here and wait for him to get done, everyone walking out looks good too."
0,"I love the location but the service last few times I've been there has been really slow and for lack of better words is really poor. There's two specific girls that are always behind the bar that take to go orders and they just don't look happy to be there and have been some what rude when I placed my order. Will I continue to come here, yes because I love the food but always get my food to go. No reason to dine in there if the customer service is going to continue to be the same"
1,"I am not given to superlatives, but \""O\"" is easily the best show in Las Vegas, and possibly the best in the world.  But if you take my word for it and go with expectations of the unbelievable, you may be disappointed.  And you may resent the substantial amount of dough you plunked down for tickets.\n\nOn the other hand, if you go without SPECIFIC expectations and just let the experience wash over you, not trying to follow the story line -- which doesn't exist in any case -- you most likely will leave with a grin on your face, a smile in your heart, and a five star review forming in your head.  It's happened to me four times over the years.\n\nHere are a few hints --\n\nTHE DOS:\n1.  The best seats are around the tenth to fifteen rows (row one is indeed \""A\"" here), and not towards the sides.  The main theater consists of sections 101 - 105, with 103 being the center.  102 and 104 are also fine.  Order way ahead - O often sells out.\n2.  I like the 10:00 time better because this is a stream-of-conciousness type of show and a couple of drinks (just a couple) frees the mind.  You can buy them just outside the theater and carry them in if you want.\n3.  Experience the theater itself - it is a wonder.  \""O\"" could not be performed effectively without this super-venue.\n\nTHE DON'TS:\n1.  Don't worry about the two clown routines, which are somewhat sophomoric.  They are needed to provide rest for the cast and a chance to change scenes.  You'll see why the rest is needed.\n2.  Don't focus entirely on the main performers.  Each scene has a focal point, but there will also be other things happening all over the stage.  These are an important part of the whole, so let your eyes take in the entire flow of the action.\n3.  Don't try to understand the lyrics -- consider it an sort of extra-galactic opera.\n\nBy the way, \""O\"" is a Cirque de Soliel show, of which there are five or six running in Las Vegas.  There is a simple way of determining which are the best: the shorter the name, the better the show.  \""O\"" is #1, followed by \""Ka\"", \""Love\"", etc.  Forget about Zumanity.\n\nAnd guys, if you are taking a date, \""O\"" in Las Vegas is as near a sure thing as there is."
1,"Had some time to kill between the Chandler BBQ & Beer Festival and the Dbacks night game at Salt River Fields when I remembered the Zipp's Bus!  The bus makes multiple trips between Zipp's and Salt River fields for all Spring Training games before and after so you can avoid parking fees and sitting in traffic on the way out of the game. Sure you spend your parking fee and then some on booze and food, but we still had a good time.  The food was decent, we ordered some chicken nachos and later on their chicken \""skewers\"", which we basically chicken strips on a stick.  Our server was attentive as our beers stayed cold and some pregame shots were consumed.  If I lived closer by this would be a regular spot for me for sure."
1,"Looks like I got lucky and found this place after a change in management per yelper Kevin S. I've been here three times in the last month and have been very pleased with the food. I had the huge, delicious meatloaf which is very difficult to finish unless you skipped lunch and have been shoveling ashphalt all day.\n\nThe Rib and Shrimp baskets are excellent and filling as well; the baskets, softdrink and tip will set you back about $14. The steak fries are the way to go when you order a basket, they were still hot when I finished my last fry. \n\nThis place is crazy busy when there is a major sporting event. But I will definitely become a regular."
1,"Grimaldi's Pizzaria is a GEM of a restaurant in a GEM of a shopping mall directly across the street from a GEM of a hotel. LOVE this place!\n\nAdriana and I were staying at the Wynn to celebrate our anniversary, and we opted for Grimaldi's on our first night there, just because we had such a good experience when we were in town last year, and we were exhausted from the 45 minute flight from Burbank. \n\nA Lego Store just opened next door, so K'ayum was already in heaven. We scored the last outside table. (OK, not outside, 'cause you're in a mall, but outside the restaurant. Got it?)  Perfect for people-watching.\n\nI ordered a carafe of chianti, and the friendly waitress even scared up an ice bucket to chill it a bit. We started with a small spinach salad  (I, Christopher C., ALWAYS start with a salad) and it was excellent and enough for the three of us to share. \n\nFor a pizza, we opted for pepperoni, spicy chicken sausage, onions, and peppers. The pizza was incredible -  the sausage was nice and spicy and the crust was perfect. It was a great meal, and my son scored a great Lego set! (Note to self: go to Lego store BEFORE consuming a carafe of wine...) \n\nI hear there's a location in Southern California - I'm going to have to look that up! But then again, Grimaldi's is a PERFECT excuse for a Vegas road trip..."
0,"Their employees are the rudest human beings alive... The host are rude and act like they own the joint and the manager Errol is the biggest jerk ever. Whatever happened to customer service and pleasing guest. They clearly have no mission they are following at this Sugar Factory in particular, the one in Town Square is def. better!"
1,"Being a vegetarian isn't always the easiest lifestyle to live.  People tease you, and give you odd looks when its brought up in conversation.  And god forbid a meal at mom and dad's goes by without someone making mention of your weird eating habits.  \nIts a good thing that Green came along to help strengthen our resolve. and more importantly, to help convince non-vegetarians that vegans and vegetarians aren't a bunch of weirdos who eat soy-paste and lentils all day.  \nWith a wide array of options on their menu, Green has enough variety to please pretty much everyone, vegan or not.  After eating here at least twice a week for the last few months I've come close to sampling the entire menu, and there really isn't a bad thing that I can say about it.  The mock chicken and the phoney beef  used in Green's sammy's are alarmingly accurate in both flavor and texture.  The curry bowls are some of the best I've had, and the orecciette pasta with chicken  parmesan is worth killing for - which is saying a lot in vegan circles.\nBottom line:  if you're in the neighborhood, you'd be a fool not to stop in and sample some of the items on the menu.  If you don't find something at green that you absolutely love, you may want to see a doctor, because there is a good chance that you are dead and haven't realized it yet.\nFinally, if the slew of rave reviews here on yelp hasn't convinced you yet, you can check out Green's menu right here:\n\nhttp://www.greenvegetarian.com/menu.jpg"
0,"Hi \nI'm sorry to say that i had a awful experience with them. I asked to write something on the birthday cake of my friend who has bad cancer who can go anytime.  One of my friend picked up the cake for him. I expected a better customer service  since I have been a loyal client for more than 6 years. I told my dying friend how good is going to be his birthday cake. When i opened the box it wasn't how i asked. Very disappointing!  We were sad, bcz the cake was the main thing. So i complined to the woner Billy to learn how much he didn't value my loyalty. He said  he will not replace the cake,said \""did we ruined ur day that much?\"" So before i flash them out of life i call them back  one more time, nothing changed. This is how much i was dissatisfied with the service. I would expect little better for my $$ n loyalty, time. \n\nSo don't ruined ur birthday like me, i do not recommend them. They lost me. In any other party  If i encounter cake coming from them i scape dessert. Bcz I wasn't valued as a long-term client  t. tnx"
1,"A friend and I were in the mood for Indian food last night for dinner, the place that I wanted to try happened to be closed due to storm damaged, still didn't want to give up on the idea of having Indian cuisine for dinner, she suggested Copper Kettle, which I have been meaning to try for awhile now. We went inside the restaurant and waited to be seated. I have to say service was excellent, never once did we have to ask for our drinks to be refilled and they were very attentive to our needs.  For starters we ordered  hummus & the tandoori naan basket, we picked Onion & Garlic, The Garlic Naan was crisp and garlic was not over powering but my favorite was the Onion Naan, it had saut\u00e9  diced onions layered in the center of the bread, so delicious both went well with their Mint Sauce! We ordered Pea Pulao, which was outstanding and very flavorful. Also ordered the Ginger Balti Chicken and Tikka Masala Chicken and on both dishes the chicken was tender and juicy, though the ginger chicken was great & full of flavor I just couldn't get enough of the Tikki Masala! Since it was my 1st time there I am definitely going back & will work my way through the menu!"
1,"I was in Pittsburgh for the week and was in desperate need of a haircut. I chose Cultural's Elite on Yelp because it was the closest to my hotel. I was blown away by how great my experience was.\nI was greeted at the door by two adorable little pups. Rachel was my stylist. She got me right in the chair and asked what it was I needed. She delivered on my every request. Sometimes people go way too short when you tell them not to. She did amazingly. After my cut, she washed my hair, dried it and cut the uneven bits. Then she offered for me to style my own hair. I let her do it because she had already been so great. \nI was in and out in 40 minutes. \nAll in all....a great experience!\nGo there!"
1,"I went last Memorial Day weekend for my brother's 50th birthday dinner.(8 adults,2 kids). Everyone sampled someone else's meal but most of the group got steaks (I didn't but wish I had tried the wagyu beef). I loved my crab cakes and the shared creme brulee. We had a private area & an attentive waiter. Good food but pricier than I would have wanted to pay (meal was a treat by my brother to all of us). We were there a good 3 hrs with drinks,meals & desserts and no one rushed us."
1,This is the best pizza I have ever had.  The owners are very nice and make you feel at home.  I always order the garlic knots and the white pizza.  I don't know where they get their cheese but it is amazing.  The crust is very good and it is fun to watch them toss the pizza.  They have a few good beers on tap and some decent wine as well.  The manicotti is also delicious.\n\nThe owners are from Italy and ran a Pizza shop in NY City for many years.  It is the real deal.  If you want great pizza you wont be disappointed.
0,"Thank god it's closed. My boyfriend once caught a guy trying to reach into my purse while I was making my way through the crowd. Another guy then straight up asked him if he knew where he could get blow, as he was from out of town and just ran out. That was our first and last visit."
1,"I went to Daily Dose on a Saturday. There were plenty of empty tables inside, but my friend and I decided to wait for a table on the patio. The hostess was efficient seating us once a table became available. I had the veggie burger. I told the waitress I couldn't decide between sweet potato fries and regular fries. She suggested I get the combo, which is offered on the lunch menu, not the dinner menu. I thought that was nice of her, since I wouldn't have known about it otherwise. I can't wait to go back and try other items on the menu."

1,"It's extremely unfair the power the colour pink has over me, and as always it drew me into this home d\u00e9cor shop. My friends and I had just got a new flat, so I was curious to see if I could find anything to jazz it up here. However, after five minutes perusing the shelves, I realized it is no Ikea! \n\nA lot of their products are hand made, like some of the crockery and quilts I saw in there, and though they've just recently downsized from doing a lot of furniture (which is hand made as well!) the store's still brimming with just about everything you'd ever think to put in your home; kitchen utensils, bedding, artwork, jewelry, soaps and lotions, baby clothes (I thought the baby jam, which was basically a baby outfit packed into a jam jar, was hilarious). So one can see why it's a little bit pricey. \n\nI was lucky enough to meet a lady who actually makes a lot of the stuff herself, especially the quilts. She's also got a blog, www.bearpawandbearpaw.blogspot.com (how quaint!) which simply appeals to the inner little girl in me.\n\nI'm hoping for a group flat trip there when everyone's back in Edinburgh, even if all we get is one of those huge, vintage looking clocks on their walls!"
0,"My experience at Landis last weekend was far less than stellar.  Their customer service is very questionable, and they refused to fix my cruiser...until AFTER I had tipped one of the guys there for looking at it.  Let me give you the whole story...\n\nOn Saturday morning I called in at 9:04 AM (four minutes after they opened) and explained that I had a bike cruise later that afternoon and my bike needed just a little love after a past wreck - the front wheel wobbled.  The guy on the phone expressed that they do not schedule repairs for Saturdays because it is so busy, and that if I wanted to have my bike looked at I'd have to schedule for Monday through Friday.  Since the cruise was that day, I asked if they would be able to just take a look at it and repair if it's not a huge issue...because Monday would be far too late....and that I don't mind waiting a while, if they could fit it in between helping customers.  The guy (Tim? Tom?) agreed, said sure, bring it in.  So I did...\n\nAfter arriving at the store 20 minutes later, a different guy came out of the back to talk to me.  His name was Eric and he gave me the whole speech again, told me how there's no way they could look at it today. I explained that the guy on the phone told me he would try to fit in in and told me to come down, or I wouldn't have.  After about 20 minutes of listening to him scold me about Saturday repairs, he finally agreed to put my bike on the \""table\"" and look at it.  I thanked him profusely, gave them my phone number, and left.\n\nHalf an hour later I\""m at breakfast with my friend and I get a text saying there is an issue with the fork and they cannot fix my bike for liability reasons.  So I go into the store after breakfast and talk with Eric.  He says they didn't get any further on my bike than noticing that the fork is bent, and that they cannot work on it...and that they CANNOT fix it.  I asked a couple different ways.  This is my $50 craigslist cruiser, and while it was a cheapy, I've had it for a couple years and I'm attached to it.  I asked what I could do with it.  \""Throw it away.  We sell cruisers starting at $249.\"" \n\nBummed out, I thanked him for at least looking at my bike.  They didn't charge me anything since they didn't actually do anything, so I tipped the guy $10.  \""At least I can buy you lunch.\""\n\nAs I'm wheeling my bike out of the store, a guy calls from the back \""We could order the fork.\""  What??  So my bike CAN be fixed??  Another guy comes out and measures the fork, tells the other guy what needs to be ordered.  They both say they can order the piece and it will be there in a week.  Eric is already off in another part of the store, ignoring me after having driven off any hopes of sales from me.  So this other guy says he will order the part. \n\nIn retrospect, here is my issue.  Every conversation I had with them was wrought with discomfort.  The first guy told me to throw my bike away, did not AT ALL care for my business (I guess because it was just a repair on what he considered a junk cruiser?  I don't know...) and they ONLY offered to help me AFTER I gave them money.  \n\nI called back 20 minutes later and told them not to bother ordering the part.  I'd like to go somewhere with my bike that actually appreciates me as a customer."
0,"We had seen the commercials for this place often, so we thought we would try it for lunch.  We discovered this was not a good idea.  First we waited in the front to be seated while no one even noticed us for about 5 minutes, and we were the only ones there. Then the plates on the table had greasy marks all over them, and my napkin was wet before I even sat down.  The salsa tasted like it was from a jar and the bean dip was fairly flavorless.  The chips were fine.  I ordered two ground beef tacos with rice and beans.  I thought how wrong could I go with this?  It was the worst taco I have ever had in my life.  It was greasy and gristly.  The beef had a horrible flavor.  The side of beans tasted like a glob of refried beans from a can, and ironically were the only thing I could choke down.  I was also surprised at the higher prices than I had anticipated.  I feel completely ripped off by this experience and will never, ever go to Arriba anywhere again.  Try Serranos for a cheaper much tastier and cleaner experience!"
0,"The food is okay, definitely not worth the price, Pei Wei is just as good maybe even better and it is much more affordable.  We received the worst service at this location multiple times and will not return."
0,This place turned me off! I was approved for credit! I went in to buy a washer and dryer. The price match guarantee is only good if the same product is in the competitors weekly ad! What? So I should pay $200+ more for your washer because you approved me for credit? It's a scam and a great way to get a bad name.
0,"Do not waste your time at this hotel. Don't be cheap like us, spend the extra dollars at a nicer hotel like the Encore, Wynn, MGM, Venetian, any hotel but this. Very poor communication with from management and staff. \n\nThe first night we got there we weren't even able to get a key for any of the 3 rooms we booked because they said our name wasn't on those rooms even though we paid with our credit card. \n\nBy the time we left and got back home there were a bunch of unauthorized charges on our card and when we called to question the charges TI told us all this bullcrap we were never informed about. \n\nLike I said, do not waste your time here. All the hassle almost wasn't worth my first trip to Vegas since I turned 21. \n\nAlso, the coffee shop restaurant wasn't even that good. We were the only people in the restaurant at 1am and the service still sucked. \n\nTerrible staff, terrible management, terrible coffee shop/restaurant, just a terrible hotel in general.

0,"Worst company in the world to do business with. They rip you off, and do bait switches on their customers. All the reviews you are reading here are correct. They will NOT GIVE YOU THE CAR YOU PAID FOR IN ADVANCE NO MATTER WHAT. I PAID for a Ford Fusion, and when I got their to pickup my reservation, they told me that the Ford Fusion was not available but they will give me a car of the \""same class,\"" a Kia Rio. If you know a little bit about cars you know that the Kia Rio is a sub-compact in the same class as a Nissan Versa or a Toyota Yaris. \n\nI argued with the manager on duty and they find a Corolla they say they can put me inn. I still argue that they are moving me into a compact vehicle and a not \""mid-size\"" sedan as promised UNDER CONTRACT. Manager continues to argue that they have no car in that class, and when I go to angrily to take the Corolla (as I have already wasted an hour arguing) I see they have a Hyundai Sonata just waiting to be picked up. I ask the person working in giving out the cars and he argues that the Sonata is an upgrade and not a mid-size sedan and a Corolla is a mid-size sedan. After realizing that the person had an IQ of a peanut (along with the rest of their employees) I decide to take the Corolla and be on my way.\n\nAlong the course of this they tried to make me $94 reservation into a $250 reservation with crappy insurance and other services and \""you have to pay for full tank of gas.\"" I got out of all of that just paid the $94. \n\nAfter coming back from my trip i pursued my case through corporate and got in touch with a person named: SUZETTE GERFY (who is supposed to be the city manager) and she was absolutely no help, she said we take pride in customer service and will give a discount coupon for your next rental with Payless.

I decided to treat my mom to lunch and when we walked in it was about 85 degrees in the dining room. Why you ask, the front door was perched open.  Why you ask, i have no idea...we are in the desert the last time i checked. Anywho, i ordered gumbo & a catfish poboy. Both were delish. My mom ordered the red beans & rice...she enjoyed her choice. For me a good dining experience usually means good food & good service. the food was good the service was just ok. no smiling faces when seated, no smiling face from our waiter.  Actually the only time the waiter smiled was when he asked to clear the table and I said yes. I am eager to give Lola's one more try! Next time i will bring a fan.\n\nFOODIEDIVA.com"

If they just improve a few things, this is a 5 star place, but the food enough is reason to come back!"

1,"Went there with a group of friends last weekend (January 10, 2014) to see Joe Rogan, and was unsure how it was going to be, because of previous bad experiences at the Tempe Improv.  But....We had a fantastic time.  The show was amazing and our server was outstanding.  She was definitely on top of things.  She approached me and took my drink order the second I sat down.  We didn't have to wait long for drinks or food.  My group did the dinner package so that way we could have reserved seats....that's definitely the way to go.  It's not very expensive, the food is tasty, and it covers your two drink minimum.  It does tend to become a pretty pricey evening the moment you order an alcoholic beverage though....their drinks seem to be an average of $15.....but, you have to be prepared for that when going out to an evening like this.  They have a great line-up of comedians.....we will definitely be back :)"
1,"I didn't realize this place is \""brought to you by the creators of Cheesecake Factory.\""  Well that explains the good food.  I ordered a Calypso Mojito, the Rare Ahi Tuna Salad, and I shared in some of the Fudge Cake Collision.  The mojito was pretty good, the ahi tuna was amazing, and the cake was also pretty good.  Combine that with nice decor and decent service and I'd say it's worth repeat trips.\n\nI've been to the other Grand Lux inside Venetian (technically, this one is the \""other\"" Grand Lux).  I think I like the Palazzo version better simply for the layout and decor.  It feels a little more intimate."

I had made the decision to not go back, however they were supposedly under new management after their remodel.  Guess again, they either rehired the same idiots or just trained new ones to be that dumb.\n\nToday the manager was extremely rude about a mistake her worker made while taking the order.  It took 3 times of her refunding and reordering to get it right.  How hard is to ring in 3 items (none of which were a Quarter Pounder) and get it wrong and different totals.  No apology only a sarcastic, \""Are you happy now!\"" remark.\n\nAnd just a note, you CANNOT get your drink large at this McDonald's without upsizing the entire meal.

Then when we saw the person that signed up right before us go up and then one of the same \""three\"" girls and then the host \""randomly\"" pick again.....we got pissed of and were ready to leave.

Then he had the nerve to call our names when we walked right out of the door.  We came back in and talked to management.  We were there to have a good time and spend money.  I would rather spend my money elsewhere.  Star karaokee sux, IDK what the hell Michael the Karaokee host from star karaokee's problem was, but he was completely unprofessional and just plain RUDE.

It's always crowded and the lines are really long.\n\nIt's an older store in an older strip mall in a not-so-good part of town, but it's near me and sometimes I end up here getting a little somethin'-somethin' and I always kinda regret it.  It's poorly stocked, always a bit dirty, and smells a little funny.\n\nTake the time and run southeast a few blocks and hit up Sunflower instead.  It's worth it."
0,"This place is AWESOME!  I'd recommend everyone take management's advice and try your entree with the chef's hair...it truly is something you won't get anywhere else (we'll...you'll get it here and there, but mgmt probably won't promote it).  \n\nIf you are slightly adventurous like me, order the clay pot with beef stew and turnip.  When I got mine, there was a hair on one of the turnips in the stew (I'm definitely one of the lucky ones...don't be jealous Lana Del Rey!).  No big deal, i get that it happens...so I wait until my waitress checks on us and point out the hair.  The waitress then picks up the pot for a close inspection and acknowledges that it is truly human hair (good thing she did, since my vision at age 34 is deteriorating quickly).  She then holds the pot, looks at me, and asks what I would like her to do (she is young..i'm guessing in her early 20's, speaks English fluently, probably grew up in Phoenix and is part of the restaurant owner's family, at least to my understanding).  Since she is new to this culture of 'eating out at a restaurant', I advise her that my preference is for the kitchen to re-make me the dish.  The waitress gives me a stunned look (since I am asking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow) and tells me that the hair is only on one turnip.  She then puts the clay pot back on the table, and provides me her advice.  She (and Confucius) says that I should simply remove the turnip with the hair from the stew and continue eating the dish.  (Whoop, there is it!).  \n\nMy first reaction was that this was crazy, but then I realized... the human hair was actually being used as an ingredient in giving flavor to the stew/broth.  Although not meant to be eaten, it was one of the magical ingredients that made the food at Nee House special.  No wonder the waitress looked at me like I was a leprechaun (and not the lucky charms type, more like the scary 90's movie version...you know the one they did so many sequels of)!\n\nWell, it is May, but Happy St. Patty's Day, and go check out Nee House!  It is a dining experience you won't forget.  \n\nTip: Keep your fingers crossed you get the early 20's female waitress (I think she's the only one in that age group working as a waitress there).  She will make sure you get the royal treatment."

1,"The best burger I have ever had! The # 5 milkshake was very good too. Not a lot of it but pleasantly not over sweet. I am a low carber and although they offered lettuce wrap, I sacrificed the carbs and ate half the bun. OMG good!  Shared the milk shake. Beer battered onion rings were good but would have been better with twice the onion. Overall highly recommend this place. We had an hour wait but they take your # and text you when ready so you don't have to stand in line. Awesome overall."
1,"Loved breakfast and lunch here. Great ingredients, great food. Very friendly staff and reasonable prices."
1,"Make no mistake, Max Brenner serves food, but it is only so you won't feel guilty about eating their chocolate desserts.  Hence they have a reminder on their menu - Food first then dessert.  Any place that gives you syringes filled with warm chocolate ganache to squirt in your mouth is a place worth visiting.  \n\nThe regular food menu did not have anything that really enticed my tastebuds - sandwiches, burgers, etc.  So we ordered some appetizers that sounded good.  Mac n cheese with marinara on the side - don't ask, that is a new one for me.  It was very cheesy, a bit salty, some bacon added, but nothing that great.  The waffle fries which are supposedly dusted with chili cocoa powder were run-of-the-mill.  I could not taste the difference with regular waffle fries and the dipping sauce they came with overwhelmed the dish with saltiness.  The hummus sampler was ok, a bit too bland, but the pita chips had a great crisp on the outside and soft on the inside.\n\nThe black and tan beer battered onion rings are worth a special mention.  Most beer battered onion rings I have had at other places are overfried and bland.  When you take a bit into these, you get a wonderful hoppy, malty flavor and aroma from the beer.  A bit of a surprise if you are not expecting it, but a depth of dimension you cannot find elsewhere.\n\nNow getting to the desserts.  The sharing tasting menu is a good starting point for those who can't decide.  It states on the menu that it is good for two but you can actually have 4 people share.  There is just wayyy too much chocolatey goodness for just 2 people.  It is comprised of :\nchocolate banana waffles\nchocolate crispy eggroll\nmilk and white chocolate bar\nchocolate sponge cake\ncrunchy little chocolate pearls\nchocolate fondue with grill and fruits and marshmallows\nand chocolate ganache to drizzle over everything.\n\nThe chocolate fondue is very fun as you can toast your marshmallows then dip into the melted chocolate.  After sharing this plate, I got a shock of chocolate euphoria which resulted from the the endorphin rush.\n\nAn absolute must have is the suckao.  Although the name makes it sound like a porno term, it is a combination of suck and cacao.  It is like the hot chocolate drinks that you can find in Europe.  You basically get a little container of milk (I recommend whole) which is kept heated over a little tea candle.  Then you also have a choice of what chocolate you want - dark, milk, or white (dark recommended).  From here you add the chocolate to the milk to your liking stirring with a spoon that doubles as a straw.  As the chocolate melts and combines with the milk, you get a rich chocolate beverage, essentially chocolate ecstasy.  You are technically making your own miniature ganache and drinking it.  Few things in life can produce such joy.  If you are not use to such huge amounts of chocolate, take caution as it will literally give you a high.\n\nBest Thing - Hot chocolate"
1,"Awesome company. We had them come seal the tile in our newly built home. They were early, friendly, meticulous, and even applied a third coat of sealer to high traffic areas. They consulted with my wife as to which cleaning products would work better than others, and were in and out in a short time. And they came in under budget too. Will use them again in a heartbeat."
1,"Can't comment on the Minus5 experience, since I didn't do it, so this review is for the Lodge Bar connected to it. Great place to sit down in the afternoon and watch some football. It was not crowded and the waitresses were really nice. I had some pleasant, quiet alone time away from the kids. \n\nThanks wifey!!"
1,"Food and drink wise, there's much to love here.  We've gone here several times and the food has always been stellar.  Try their Bloody Mary, which often features a pickle spear garnish, pickled by the bartender himself!  A nice touch.\n\nService has always been friendly and knowledgeable; what has been inconsistent is the speed and attentiveness, both of which can be spotty.  When you do have a server's attention, all's well with the world.  Luke himself is often at the front of the house, and he's a warm, friendly presence there.\n\nA nice room with a loft feel, good for people-watching on Penn.  A great place to bring out-of-town guests.  Love it!"
1,"De tr\u00e8s bonnes portions pour un prix correct, la bouffe est d\u00e9licieuse! J'ai mang\u00e9 la cuisse de poulet sur charbon de bois et c'\u00e9tait succulent.

1,"As a former \""salon guy\"" I first came into Rony's shop because of its location and convenience to where I hang out.  After just one cut with him, I am now a \""barber shop guy\"".  His cuts are super fast and very accurate - and trust me, I am a stickler.  Now since I moved its not nearly as convenient, but I don't mind because the service is always so great!"
1,"I really liked this place, and haven't had anything quite like it. \n\nWhen my colleague first suggested it - a place that combined Chinese & Mexican - I was intrigued. Then he mentioned it was featured on the Food network. Sure, I was in. \n\nSince I had no expectations going in (how could I possibly expect anything? I had no idea how you could combine these two cuisines), I was quite pleased with the result. I got the Jade Red chicken and the Pollo Diablo, and loved both!"
0,"Never write any bad review before but I have to for this restaurant. \n\nWe went to this Thai restaurant yesterday and had really bad experience.The location is the only great thing for this restaurant. The staffs were rude. I didn't even finish eating my food, she took my plate away.  Not many people were there, why did they have to rush? We went there to enjoy eating and talking to friends. \n\nFood was ok and the price is too expensive!!! We ordered just 5 orders but it costs us $250!!! We tried to check the price but they were rushing us and cleaning the table and took the bill away with credit card. I saw they already added gratuity but didn't see details of what they charged for the food. Many restaurants have policies of automatically charging a certain percentage for a gratuity, often 18 percent, if you have a group of eight or more. BUT we went there just a group of FOUR!! This is so shady!!!\n\nBAD SERVICE\nPRICEY\nSHADY ON THE BILL\nOK FOOD\n\nWE WILL NEVER GO BACK THERE AGAIN!!"
0,"I was very disappointed on how dry their cake was. The one thing that was done correctly was the fondant on the outside of the cake. The cake was so dried you can visabley tell before taking a bite into the cake. Not sure how old they let their cake sit there before delivering their cake, but we called a month in advance to make sure the cake would be done correctly. If you need a cake for presentation only, then order here. If you need a cake to at least taste somewhat decent, then order else where. The cake was cut into 2 hours after it was delivered, so it was not sitting out for every long. Their cake was drier then my grandmother's skin."
0,"If you don't have a table here for bottle service, then don't bother.  Went here for Zedd and the line was absolutely ridiculous.  It was all over the place.  No ropes to separate the three lines (Presale, General Admission, Guest List).\n\nI am a guy.  How did I, along with 15 other males, get in before a group of girls (15+) in our group.  I shouldn't complain, but that's just the start.  We waited almost two and a half hours for the girls in our group to come in.  By that time, we were pissed and left.  A COMPLETE WASTE OF $100.  Why?  It was packed and our group was now separated and pissed off.\n\nThe whole Cirque du Soleil thing was really nice.  Added a nice visual aside from all the lights and lasers for your typical EDM club.\n\nWould I come here again?  Probably not."
1,"Second time at Cowboy Ciao. I'm just flat out addicted to the Stetson Salad. Aside from eating off my husbands plate, that's the extent of my food knowledge here. And yes... it's as good as they say. \n\nWe live in Chandler and like the drive to Scottsdale. This is becoming one of our \""places\"". The wine list is extensive and if the immediate staff isn't knowledgeable about the wine they will find someone who is. The ambiance isn't formal, it's laid back and fun more than formal. The down side is that the tables are really close and some of them are really small. Depending on where you sit you can be rubbing elbows with the table next to you. Not a bad thing if you're friendly :) \n\nI won't give it five stars as I really only eat the salad and because the service can be a tad spotty. I've noticed they have a few staff with \""tudes\"". I write t it off as a Scottsdale thing. But... still not okay."
1,"I would give 5 if I could. 3 if they were not so new. \n\n3 of us showed up yesterday, 5-22 about 8pm. We were greeted and seated inside in the corner. Which is fine if the corner had some design atmosphere. \n\nReally liked the menu style (design, layout, paper, items (lose the hyphens)). Ordered a couple OHSO cocktails. \""Shhh\"" they were called. Refreshing! (still did not know our server's name until we asked after apps).  \n\nOrdered the Steak and Fries app. About 5 minutes to the table. I could live on these...Happily! They are amazing. Once we finished the app, within 2 minutes our entrees arrived... Diablo burger Medium with OHSO sauce on side (Bloody Mary Mix, Horseradish, maybe some 1000 island or mayo mixed in) Good tangy flavor with some heat. I had to send back because the meat was rare and slapped me in the face. They did not do a re-fire, actually made a whole new burger (good work). A bit over medium. But good flavor and you can taste all the items perfectly. The bun, reminiscent of Kings Hawaiian Bread (soft but not sweet). Problem is the bottom holds a lot of weight, heat, juice and within 2 bites, it's completely in pieces. But I did slop up every crumb on the dish. Guest 2 had the same with side of ranch (I am a ranch fan... but it seemed to be kinda zingy like the Hidden Valley Farms, not like homemade buttermilk/mayo (the type you use on wings, pizza, fries, etc)). He had already killed his burger by the time mine arrived. Instructed me to flip it over to attempt to save the bun. Guest 3 had veggie burger sub fries for salad. I tasted the burger... one of the best veggie patties I have had in AZ and Los Angeles. \n\nWhy the 4 and not the 5? - Decor seems lacking in some areas, there are visually cold spots in the building. Flow is not bad. Price points for some items are a bit high. I figure they will find the loss leaders soon and adjust. $100 for three burgers, 1 app, 1 beer, 2 cocktails.  There are other places with same quality and better deal, but it is NoSco!\n\nBIG ISSUES: \n1) no true identifying uniforms to figure out who works there and who doesn't. Thus you find yourself visually confused as to who to ask a question.\n2) timing timing timing... in a period of 15 minutes we had ordered, ate and looked at each other to figure out if we were going to get a second drink. Meaning, that the servers need to pace the kitchen, watch the tables, get more drinks to the guests, up that ticket avg. That timing is great for time-pressed lunch crowds. \n\nIt should become a NoSco hotspot with a long lifespan. It's immediate competitors are: FourPeaks and TwinPeaks. (actually delete TwinPeaks, it's just terrible in so many ways). FourPeaks has the beer, the size, the longevity. But I think the two can co-exist happily and thrive. \n\nWe will be back..."
0,"This is a nice looking but poorly designed hotel. Despite having over 300 rooms, they only have 2 elevators. I was here for a convention with a friend who recently had foot surgery and needed a wheelchair. Lets just say other hotel guests were not gracious about giving us priority on the elevators even though we were on the second floor and even the largest of humans should be able to manage 1 flight of stairs with 2 good feet. Checkout was a nightmare because of this elevator situation. Fortunately a staff member was kind enough to allow us access to the service elevator after he saw how rude the guests were about this.\n\nThe food is also terrible and overpriced. Several people at the convention developed food poisoning after consuming the calamari. That was no fun for anybody. I highly recommend the Sprecher Brewery restaurant across the street - comprable prices but larger portions and significantly better food! \n\nThe temperate throughout the facility is horrible as well. Our room was cold no matter how high we adjusted the thermstat and the convention space was hot enough that I nearly fainted on at least 2 occasions. The only reason this hotel gets 2 stars is because it was clean and the beds were extremely comfortable with their down-filled duvets and fluffy pillows."
0,Decided to stay here in Vegas for a staycation we chose the Aria Hotel and Casino because of $100 dining credit that came with the two nights during Christmas.  Upon check-in they told me I didn't have any $100 credit voucher when I clearly booked for one.  After telling them how I booked and how it was all over the internet when I booked the hotel manager on duty still did not honor my credit.  He told me I could cancel my reservation if I wanted to.  How rude?  Really??? I am already to check in and he tells me to cancel.  I was already upset upon checking in so I knew it wasn't going to be a great experience after 45 min. of trying to argue for my credit.  Oh well...I checked in to the rooms anyway because I wont let this incident ruin my stay.  After checking in they did call to say they honor it but I was already upset and so was my wife.  Definitely not 5 star service.  \nValet was awful as well since they didn't open the doors for my wife and family and just threw the keys on the seats.  I felt like they just want the tip and not give a real experience.  Overall I think the property was beautiful but the customer here sucks!!!\nI will definitely not be returning here for future stay.
0,"I've only been here once, but the wait in line didn't seem worth it, and there weren't many options on the menu.  I was expecting there to be slightly more on the menu than eggs + bacon and pancakes.  \n\nAlso, prepare yourself to reek like bacon grease when you walk out of Ironworks cafe.  I don't think they have a very good ventilation system or something because my clothes and hair absolutely stunk afterward.\n\nI strongly disagree with other reviewers that say this is the beast breakfast in town.  They obviously haven't been to Sophia's or La Brioche. :D"
1,I am so happy this location opened up.  It's so close to home and honestly better than any other pizza place I have ever been too.  The serious slices are as big as a new born baby and taste like GOD himself kneaded the dough.  I would recommend this place to any and everyone I meet.
1,"When Steve Wynn announced that he was going to build this hotel on the former Desert Inn property many years ago, I wondered how he was going to top the Bellagio, which was his signature hotel at that time.  Of course he created one of the most luxurious casino resorts that Vegas has ever seen....featuring:\n\n- A Ferrari dealership.\n\n- A luxurious poker room.\n\n- Spectacular rooms.\n\n- A 5 Star Golf Course.\n\n- Awesome restaurants, bars, and nightclubs.\n\n- High end gambling options.  This place is not for the low limit player.\n\nWhen my Wife and I want to treat ourselves to a nice evening, we come here.  Will I return?  You can count on it."
1,"Very nice atmosphere. Not too busy so it makes getting your morning coffee relaxing when you are not fighting a line. The toffee nut latte is amazing!! The breakfast burrito was questionable at first but overall good. The potatoes are a little heavy, would be nice with ground sausage. There is not really a good menu that is displayed so you have to hold your face up to glass to see what they have."
0,"When you go out to dinner, you want good food and sometimes, good service and a pleasantly friendly staff just are not enough.  The sushi at Pearl is not really good.  I was disappointed at the rolls - the accompanying sauces were colorful although boring and tasteless.  I tried a roll with a slice of tuna on the top and the tuna was a little warm - NOT what you want when eating sush.  I had the yellowfin - and was not impressed.  The quality of the fish was off.  I also tried the calamari which was fried in a funky batter which over powered the taste of the calamari.  \nI have to admit that after two rolls, calamari and yellowfin tuna, I stopped ordering bc the food did not taste good.  \nThe one great thing about Pearl is the service and the staff.  They are friendly, but not in an annoying way.  They tried very hard to please my party and I liked it.  When they found out we would be writing a review for yelp - the free shots came - and that was a nice BONUS. ;) \nI recommended to the my server and a woman he introduced as a manager that the place needed some sushi quality aspects to it, i.e. fresh warm towels prior to the meal as any self respecting sushi eater, eats with their hands. The manager replied, \""that was not a good idea because this is an asian restaurant.\""  Yikes, right?  She was friendly and kind but her ignorance was pretty disappointing.\nI unfortuantely will not be going back to Pearl to eat again - however, I would go back for the drinks and the fun service!"
1,This place is amazing....the food is delicious and quick...worth the wait all though they said about 1/2 an hour we got seated in 20 mins...the staff is super friendly even though it's really slammed....I got the five spot best egg sandwich I have had in a long time...the organic apple juice is great as well as the strawberry honey lemonade....come down to matts big breakfast :)
0,"The Burgers are Too asian style for my Taste. I dont want to est an asian style Burger. I love it american style. \nSo no foie Gras, terriaki souce,aioli for me. I want burger Fries& Ketchup. \n\nThe prices are Same like on the Strip so. It dosnt make sense to o there. I d rather Prefer to eat at the Strip for the Same amount. \nService was Good. \nFood ok\nBoba milk tea was ok. 4$ come on for a tiny glass. \n\nSweetpotato Fries were chewy. \n\nWill Not go back. Sorry but Vegas has much more to offer."
0,"My husband scheduled us an appointment at this office for two reasons:  It was only a mile and a half from our house, and the contracted rate for the dentist's services was the most reasonable in the area.  (We both work with a health insurance company, so we're knowledgeable about how providers are billed.)\n\nUpon arriving, we were both very impressed with the office design.  The whole design was based off a train station, or rather, a toy train station.  There's a rail near the ceiling that runs throughout the office.  Everything upfront is wooden and has an antiquated feel.  It really is sight to behold.  Even if you don't ever get services rendered, I would suggest anyone to marvel the imagination that went into this office.\n\nThe front-office staff was definitely less than stellar.  To be specific, the young, blond woman upfront was very welcoming and professional.  Even when she handed me what I'm sure she realized was an embarrassing amount of paperwork to complete, she did so with a smile.  I enjoyed her.\n\nHer colleague struck me as unfriendly and irritated by slow patient check-ins or unsuccessful insurance verifications.  I didn't have direct interactions with her; this was only my observation.\n\nI do want to state that, although I didn't see him, I heard the dentist talking with a walk-in patient who had some questions.  From a customer-service stance, the man was very good at using well-positioned statements, using empathetic language, and providing options.  I was VERY impressed with him even though I never even saw his face (because I was filling out paperwork).\n\nThe patient rooms are also nice and modern, with flat-screen monitors, well-kept and clean instruments, and open environments.  Some offices give the impression of cramming in as many patients as possible, as if we're Chicken McNuggets.  Not the case with this one.\n\nThe salesperson approach was apparent the moment I went to the examination room.  The hygienist, while nice and professional, talked about issues she noted with my teeth while positioning them with services that I knew my insurance wouldn't cover and would, resultantly, allow for balance-billing.  I also discussed the need for me to resume my orthodontic treatment, since I pulled my braces off six months before after I lost my insurance.  The salesperson approach kicked into overdrive with the gratuitous praise heaped upon the orthodontist, someone who apparently always uses the \""most cutting-edge\"" technology in all of Phoenix.  In fact, she mentioned this twice during my visit.  The whole discussion was so glib.\n\nWhat irritated me most was that I was originally scheduled for a standard cleaning.  They never got around to that.  They discussed with me the need for a deep-scale, which I knew I needed, but I also knew that I had to schedule that after my standard cleaning.  Instead, when I asked about whether I could get any treatment while I was there--at the least, a cleaning--the hygienist stated that they had a 3 p.m. appointment that they had to tend to, so they wouldn't be able to get to me that day.  In essence, I never got what I came for.  Yeah, not the professional response I expected.\n\n(On a separate note, my husband was scheduled at the same time.  They were successful in getting his cleaning done and, according to him, they never took a salesperson approach with him.)\n\nThey provided me a treatment plan, with associated costs, which was another irritant.  Apparently, their contracted rate was nearly double what the insurance company told me it would be.  Although I have a co-insurance, this, nonetheless, increased costs by nearly twofold.\n\nI left the office with scheduled appointments for my deep-scale and fillings, but after I got home and thought about the entire experience, I made the decision that I'd seek services elsewhere.  If the blond woman and the faceless dentist I heard ran the entire office, I'd happily pay premium dollar for the service.  However, the other front-office professional, hygienist, and my dentist assured me that I would never return.\n\nMy husband raved about the office the entire time home.  I hope they both have a long, illustrious relationship together.  No thanks for me."

0,"Mark me down as unimpressed.\n\nWe went on a late Summer evening, arriving about 6:30. The inside was a wait, but the outside was available, and for good reason: The outside pilars and ground was crawling with some sort of beetle infestation. They weren't poisonous or anything, but when we ate we could see them through the metal lattice table, strolling on the underside of the tabletop.\n\nOur server was very good, but the kitchen staff was not. My wife ordered a shrimp salad with \""light dressing\"", something the server repeated back to us from the order she had written down, and the salad arrived, soaking in salad dressing.\n\nWhen the server came back to check on us, my wife mentioned that the salad was swimming in dressing. Our server immediately said she'd have the kitchen make a new one with light dressing. About 5 minutes later, the manager arrived with a new salad, with lettuce on top lightly dressed. Problem solved.\n\nOr so we thought. It turns out, the kitchen staff had simply placed new lettuce on top of the salad my wife had originally had. When she got past the new layer on top, there was her old salad, still awash in salad dressing.\n\nThe manager returned, and offered another, new salad. My wife declined, saying that she was full at this point from the earlier appetizer and the lettuce and shrimp she had eaten from the first two iterations of the salad and couldn't possibly eat a third. Nonetheless, the manager returned about 5 minutes later with another salad, which we wound up taking home--she didn't really want it, but there was no sense leaving it behind, even though she said at the time they didn't need to make it.\n\nA measure of a good restaurant is how it deals with mixups and mistakes like this. I confess, I thought the restaurant would have taken the salad off the check--we had ordered an appetizer, my meal and a couple of glasses of wine, so there was still a tab to be paid. But when the check came, the salad was on it. In their eyes, I suppose, their three attempts to get a simple request right was sufficient effort.\n\nAs for what I had...I have no recollection of what it was. That is how forgettable it was. I think it was a pasta dish. I know I was eating most of it alone, as my wife's food was off the table twice in the attempts to get her order right.\n\nThis restaurant clearly has pretensions of being an upscale dining experience. From what we saw, it has a long way to go before it can claim to have reached that goal. Both of us spent a lot of time that evening looking across the patio to the seating for Cantina 1511, wishing we had walked in their door instead."
0,"Really bad service, crappy food that takes forever to get to your table, bathrooms were disgusting.\n\nYou have to get your own napkins and ask for silverware."
0,REALLLLYYY salty food.I mean i love salty food but this is beyond! Me and my fiance both Had a stomach ache couple hour after eating there.should of give a one star but only good thing bout this place is the service. Not going back there again or any red lobster!
1,"Loved it. We went there around 6 pm on a Thursday and did not have to wait in line at all. The desserts were great. I think the food was more rich than Bacchanal but the Bacchanal has more selections. The ice cream/ gelato was amazing. I like how you can order your on mac and cheese. Also, the pizza was awesome. It does not taste like those other crappy pizzas you get from other buffets. I also recommend trying the mashed potatoes. Also, good service!"
1,Oh my goodness...best burger I have had in a really long time. The burger was huge! more than enough for me to handle but very delicious with fresh ingredients toped with a tasty sauce. The  fries with my meal were also  amazing. I will definitely be back to visit anytime I'm in the phoenix area.
1,"I made a last minute decision to drop by Rent the Runway the day of a professional event. I'd looked online & saw they carried plus sizes, so I hesitantly gave it a try. \n\nI could not have been happier. Whole the selection in my size was limited, I did have an array of choices. I found a fantastic dress & paid much less than a new dress. The rental process was simple & I have four days to return it -- not one as a previous reviewer stated. I picked up Saturday morning & have to bring it back by Tuesday.  They also gave me the option of dropping the dress off at UPS. That may cost extra, but I live near the store, so I was willing to drop it back by. \n\nI will surely use them again. We are actually taking my daughter there to pick out a prom dress in a few days. Why pay hundreds for a dress she will never wear again?"
1,"Liked the old location, love the new one. Talk about friendly service! I ordered the orange roughy, but received the red fish instead. What did they do? Made it right by giving me the red fish for free, and also the orange roughy (superb dish mind you)! Was very happy with my experience here; highly recommended."
0,"This place is hit or miss.  I've been here a total of 4 times and 2 of those were bad experiences.  When they are good, they are good.  But when they are bad, well you're just stuck over paying for a burger you could have gotten at Culver's."
0,"After checking out a laser show, rainstorm, the fountains and almost all the stores at Miracle Mile, it's time for tea.\n\nWe needed change and it had started raining outside.  I like Coffee Bean's Japanese Cherry and was amused to discover you can follow them on Twitter and Facebook.  What could a coffee shop possibly have to say?  I was curious to find them and check it out but disappointed that my tea was made wrong.  The water was poured boiled hot which scorched the tea bag making my tea bitter. I drank some of it anyway because it was getting really cold in Vegas and we had to leave the shops soon for our next adventure."
1,"I have lived here for two months and am very satisfied.  Neighbors who are awesome and quiet, staff who is prompt and a nice apartment in the heart of South Park at a reasonable rate.   The only thing I am not a fan of is the carpet.  It seems like there is not enough padding underneath and it makes your feet hurt/tired."
0,"This is actually kind of sad. The customer service here is very good. Food was served quickly and tasted fine. Here's my problem. I ordered a 3 pc meal. What I got was two pieces of chicken (leg & thigh) and the one thigh had been cut into two pieces. No, really, I'm not kidding! (see photo) WTF? Are you kidding me. Then, once you get to your table and sit down, you realize the Salt Police have left a note insinuating that your eating too much Sodium and you need some extra exercise if you want the salt shaker because you have to get back up and go get one. COME ON GUYS! For a $10 meal I want 3 REAL pieces of chicken and a salt shaker! Ugh!"
1,All I can say is WOW! I've lived in Northern Italy for a year and have been looking for a pizza to compare and have never found one...until now!  It is exactly like the pizza in Italy... all the way down to the crispy edges.   Too bad I'm not from Phoenix or I'd eat here every day.  The place is small and everyone goes there so go early.  You will not be disappointed.
0,"Traveling through Phoenix, we were just looking for a light, quick bite to eat. We pulled up to one of the twin ordering stations. I thought this was a neat concept until I witnessed the not-well-thought-out merging process. The line from the second station was a straight shot to the pick-up window and the line from the first station had to merge into that line. It was a microcosm of Phoenix freeways at a McDonalds, complete with traffic jams and crazy drivers.\n\nThe food: My McBurger was dry and tasteless; my wife's chicken McNuggets were petrified and they forgot the ranch dipping sauce, which made her realize that the sauce is the only thing that saves them. \n\nThis location is convenient to the freeway, but next time we are passing through I think we'll just keep going."
0,I'm member for two years.  Lately me and my wife we do not have the time to drive to the fitness because of the kids practise every other day.  We decide to cancel the Month to Month contract.  First takes over 20 minutes on the phone.  Second they will charge you for the next Month fee because they need 30 days notice.  Third they will charge you a yearly fee.  So it may looks affordable but if you decide to cancel does not look that audible anymore.
1,"One of the things I noticed about Avondale Arizona is the abundance of chain restaurant establishments, especially north of I-10 off of Dysart Road. But if you venture on the south side of the 10, you will come across TJ's. \n\nTJ's Homestyle Restaurant is about as un-chain as you will find in these parts. A true mom-and-pop diner that serves up meals that scream comfort. My experience here came on the morning I made my way back to California after nearly a week on the road in Arizona visiting family. I can thank my brother and sister-in-law for taking me here on this morning visit. \n\nArrived to a near empty restaurant and sat down and ordered up their Ham and Mushroom omelet which came with four golden pancakes. The omelet was simple and fresh and the pancakes were fluffy and reminded me of my grandmother's pancakes (just a little beyond golden brown...but not burnt). The Hot Chocolate was out of this world good...super chocolatey and smooth with the dollop of whipped cream on top.   \n\nThe service is friendly but real cut and dry about things...like \""tell me what you want and make it fast\"". I kind of like that about this place as it's a real locals spot (witnessed locals talking about family and life with the waitress and each other). I also found it amusing that the cook came out and observed our order being taken...I guess he wants to make sure there's no mistake or screw ups in between us and him. \n\nAvondale is lucky to have a place like this...seriously...with a town full of chain restaurants, TJ's gives Avondale some much needed character when it comes to dining options."
1,"I love Sambalatte.  This is just what Vegas needed.  It is a beautiful, relaxing place with great tea and a wonderful staff.  Great place to hang out working on your computer, for a business meeting or for an outing with friends and family."
0,Really an average course that was fairly easy. The bummer was no beverage cart when we played Saturday and it was 100. I would not golf here again.
1,"The show was vibrant, entertaining, electrifying at times and fun to say the least. I loved the mixture of different music genres along w/different styles of dance.\n\nMy fav being the segment when they dance to DJ Shadow- mind-blowing!\n\nThe show was 20 minutes too long to be honest, hence the 4 stars.\n\nThey really delivered at the end and shouldve just stopped there, but the show suddenly dragged on to 20 more minutes.\n\nJabbawockeez-\n\nWe get our money's worth PLUS more with the show clocking in at an hour and 10 minutes, condense the show or add the last 20 minutes to the middle part of the show, serious.\n\nBesides that I got nothing but mad love and respect for Jabbawockeez crew, ever since ABDC baby!!\n\nThanks for an awesome show guys...great experience."
0,"I rented a standard car\nafter waiting inline for 30 minutes, the guy behind the counter tried to up sell me to an SUV for $10/day.  Low and behold, they didn't have any standard cars...so I ended up getting the SUV free of charge.  The guy helping me guilt tripped me in to buying the pre-paid gas, saying, \""it'd really do me a favor, since I did you a favor.\""  So, naturally I couldn't say no.  $50 later and only using a quarter of a tank, I feel like I was ripped off. \n\nI won't rent from Advantage again...sorry...but you got my $50."
1,"I had looked over my past reviews and felt compelled to write an update as it has been several years since my last visit, literally.\n\nI have to admit I let the one, although pretty bad, experience keep me from dining at Archi's for quite some time.  I returned only because my girlfriends wanted to meet for Thai and I wanted to enjoy their company.  I'm glad I went!\n\nThe place was packed around 1pm (assuming most diners were from the office spaces surrounding ).  It had a great energy and service ran smoothly considering the rush.  The lunch specials they had to chose from all looked amazing and was a pretty good deal.  \n\nI decided on the chicken red curry lunch special and a thai iced tea.  The special came with a soup and egg roll.  I found the portion just right for $8.  The red curry had just the right amount of spice but the flavor was out of this world!  The ingredients were fresh and chicken broke apart easily (not chewy!) I love Thai iced tea but thought it was a little too much on the sweet side.  \n\nOverall, I enjoyed the lunch special and will return soon! \n\n4/5 stars bc the Thai tea was too sweet and I found the soup (side on the special) was a bit generic in flavor.."
1,Fast service and the unsweetened iced tea is fabulous!
0,"The price is right but the food is not. Oily, heavy, greasy, uninspired, inauthentic, and just downright gross."
0,"First things first.... They did not allow me to use my military discount. Because I don't look like the \""military type\"". Even though I have my military id to prove it. The GM started asking me a billion questions. I just got fed up with it and told him at this point I don't care about the discount. 2nd thing. The rice they gave me for my fiesta line chicken was soooooooo dry it made Mohave desert seem like a resort. Yes, they did replace it with fries. But not until I asked 3 or 4 times. Horrible service. F*** their unpatriotic manager. Never going back and I wouldn't recommended anybody who's in the military that doesn't look like the \""military type\"" to go either. \nRant over."
1,"This is going to be a short review from me - a butcher, in my opinion, needs to get three things right and Saunderson's does just that:\n\nQuality Service: Check\nQuality Meat: Check\nQuality Pies: Check\n\nIf you happen to live in or pass through the tollcross area forget about supermarket meat, use a genuinely local butcher, it isn't that much more expensive and when it comes to food quality is worth that little bit extra."
0,I ate there for lunch today and my stomach has been acting up and I've been to the bathroom all day today wish I didn't eat there today. The only thing I had different from the wife was the fried chicken so I'm guessing it was that.
1,"I'm seriously giving this place a 5 star rating not because it's perfectly laid out  -- Woodman's East is really a dump. However this place has an insane variety of groceries and seriously has prices that are low, and by low, I mean lower than an Asian grocer.\n\nAnother really surprising aspect of this particular Woodman's is the variety of ethnic groceries. I have never seen chow pei yu sold in any place besides an Asian market, but this place has it. Basmati Rice is about half the price of whatever I get in Milwaukee (the city, not the street) and the beer selection in both Woodman's is incredible. Seriously, where else can you find Augustiner Br\u00e4u in Madison (or in practically any place in the U.S.)? You might think Riley's, but no, it's in good ol' Woodman's liquor section.\n\nMy real issue with Woodman's East is the frozen veggie section, which is quite lacking and not as cheap as the one in the west. Their tea selection is also lacking too. Both Woodman's stores have pretty bad seafood selection, but if you're looking for cheap and plentiful anything else, this place is it."
0,"Eh, the pizza is just okay. Its way too over rated for what it really is and way too over priced. Also, the place is very small making it very uncomfortable. The waiters seem to rush you because they have a line at the door. I will definitely not be returning; In all honesty, I think the Humble  Pie is just as good or better for a more reasonable price and better environment."
1,"Awesome! Awesome! Awesome! Loved this place! Great little spot, fresh salsa bar, fresh shrimp, good service."
1,"Fantastic treats, fantastic service and fantastic grooming!!  Love this place!!! :)"
1,"Its not so much the coffee (its great) or the food/donuts (they are great as well), its the service and the smiles they give you when you walk in the door. Every employee there is great, friendly, up beat and fun. This is my place in the morning."
0,Would give 0 stars if I could! I used to tan at the location at greenfield and brown. The owner closed the doors without notice!!!!! I had units and $115 lotion that I will never see again.  Trying to get help has been like pulling teeth. \nThis was a response I received!  DO NOT TAN HERE!!!!!!!!!
1,"One of the best places for breakfast!  Everything is amazing but beware, the portions are huge!"
1,"There's nothing more fun than checking out the latest additions to the strip & the Linq is it.\n\nOk first tip of the day is if you have a local friend that lives in Vegas, hit them up to get you a locals discount at the highroller. That $5 saving during the day comes down to $16 & some change & its less of a wait in the day.\n\n...however ...\n\nThe evening is definitely a sight to see. Lots of fun, trendy,  Vegas type things to do. With places like Yardhouse, FAME, the Quad, Polaroid Fotobar, Sprinkles Cupcake & Ice Cream, Purple Zebra & tons more I'm sure you'll find all sorts of entertainment & places to visit.\n\nFree parking is available, as well as Valet. \nIts a good place to park & walk to Cesear's Palace as well. Its a short walk across the street.\n\nDefinitely check out Polaroid Fotobar & read my review on that as well. I went back x 3. I thought it was Brilliant little store.\n\nAlso Yardhouse is always great in my books so check that out too.\n\nMy only thing is the new Purple Zebra. I'm still loyal to my Fat Tuesday so when I found out there's a location in the Quad I was more likely to go there than Purple Zebra. The cups at PZ just seemed a bit too...obscure ....for my likings, plus I like the drinks at Fat Tuesdays anyways. If you don't like the flavours at the Quad there's another location in Cesear's Forum Shops, so really you can't go wrong.\n\nOk enough of my babbling...check out the pics"
0,"flew in an out of international terminal or terminal 2. Very sub par, they need to finish the new international terminal very soon cause this one does not have much to offer accept a shorter wait for a cab."
1,"Gabriel saved my blonde hair! I went swimming about a month ago in a pool with WAY too much chlorine for my naturally light blonde hair. After weeks of using dechlorinating shampoo and conditioner to no avail, I looked for a color correcting god. Dye has never touched my hair before so I was very nervous, but after two appointments with Gabriel I am happy to say my hair looks better than ever! The first appointment he used a detox mud mask that took out about 80% of the green color caused by mineral buildup. The next day he gave me perfectly natural blonde highlights around my crown and washed the rest of my hair with a bleach/shampoo mixture that took all the green out of my hair! My hair now looks like it did when I was sixteen, and looks completely natural! Couldn't be happier!"
1,"OMG; they were right in prev reviews; it is going to a small Mexican beach restaurant. I cant believe we got a dozen oysters on the half shell for only $10.  Of course, we were lucky we went on a Friday, during their happy hour time; First visit, not the last for sure.  Everything we ordered was delicious. \nAnd, the free cup of soup, called the 7 seafood soup was great!!! Do try the shrimp tacos , as Hubby loved them,, and he is not a big tortilla fan. I want to try other  items, so we will be returning;  The prices are very reasonable, and the staff who served us was great. And, of course, I ended my meal with the Fried Ice Cream; it was awesome. The place was clean, and cheery inside,  and they even sold some seafood at the back of the eating area.  Not a lot of custom when we were there, but people should absolutely try it, Ole !!"
0,"Three reasons why I go to Ulta:\n1. They always send coupons every week\n2.I only buy Biolage, Redken or Paul Mitchell when they have the promo (buy 2 get 1 free)\n3.Close to my apt.\n\nPeople that work here aren't really helpful..surprise..surprise... \nI had to get a quick bang trim and was told that my appointment was at 7:15.. didn't get seated until 7:45.. just so that she can mess up my bangs.I was charged $20 dollars for a bang and a couple of layers. I am not an expert on cutting hair but the girl that used to trim my bangs back home did not have the same techniques as she did. I wasn't mad since it was my fault anyways that I didn't book elsewhere. Needless to say, I will never go back."
1,if it had been any less like the original i would have been sad.\ngranted i'm not totally into jazz. ( i know. i'm a monster)\nbut if you go there on an off night it's a really nice place to go to with a date\nfollowed up with of course their black and white picture booth so you can\nremember the night forever. :) isn't that romantic?
1,"Jeanette's proefssionalism, kindness and expertise will  leave your skin beautiful!"
1,"Ridiculously fabulous!! Seriously me and hubs came to check it out, however located inside the yard \""culinary dropout\"" is this little hidden gem called little Cleo's ... Wed night it is like a female hooters with all the hot guys that eye candied for me, jazzy music, fantastic food, we are in heaven. I'll add pics!"
0,"Because we own through the Marriott, this felt like a downgrade. Got food poisoning from room service and the front desk person was rude since I was trying to ask for a wake up call for an early checkout since there were so many threats in the rules and regulations if there should be a late checkout. I guess for people who have not experienced other timshares, they would love this one, but for us, we will never exchange to stay here again."
0,This was my second visit to this location. I received a lot of food for my money but the food is just okay... I love Mexican food and this place is just cranking it out without any real quality. The service was fine and I did not think it took long to wait for my food. I'm passing on this one.
1,Good chorizo. Not a fan of the salsa they bring out or the yellow cheesethey sprinkle on the dishes but everything else is good.
0,"Horrible customer service and HORRIBLE time management.\n\nI came in this morning at 730 am, right when they opened. Only one other person here at the same time, he got here 2 mins before me. I ask for a basic oil change and tire rotation, so does the other guy. It takes them 15 mins just to get my paperwork ready and get my info. At 745am, the guy helping me says the car will be ready \""within 30 mins, 45 tops\"". It's 850 am and he's still working on the tire rotation, don't even think he's done the oil change yet. The guy who got here before me was in and out in 30 mins. There's 3 guys working here and I AM STILL WAITING FOR MY VEHICLE. Meanwhile, the guy I assume is the manager, has already taken 4 smoke breaks!!! Beyond angry. It's very simple, DO NOT QUOTE A TIME YOU CANNOT KEEP. Better yet, stop dicking around and do your job. There's 3 guys here, the shop was dead, it shouldn't take over an hour and a half to get a simple oil change and tire rotation. I am NEVER coming here again."
1,"Nice hotel, friendly people and a great location. $15 for parking is a drag but the worst is the train. Who builds a hotel on top of an active train track?"
1,Bangers and mash with lots of options. Seriously I think there are about 10 different mashes and they have at least 4 different sausages each day. There's also 4 or 5 gravy options too. \n\nI tried their beef and Guinness (a special) and herby pork. Yum! I had the Moroccan mash and tomato and thyme gravy. Sort of an odd combination but it worked. Plus our meal came with cheery service!\n\nMum's has many local ales and ciders available. They pride themselves on local brews.\n\nAND they have alcoholic shakes on their menu. Bonus points from me!
1,Great pizza. I had two different pizzas. One was the Manhattan. I can't recall what the other pizza was. I came here after shopping at the Las Vegas outlet. The employees were nice. The decor is interesting and fitting. The pasta servings is enough to feed at least two people. Might be much for one average person. Wait time for our food was a reasonable five minutes for the pizza since they just needed to reheat it. The pizza took about 15 minutes to make.
0,"place is a dump.\nWalking up the stairs and you see the cheap reconditioning of the walls paint . That I could care less. Walking through the room you see dresser that's scratched up and marks of not matching paint that of something someone would picked up at a curb side. And it's half way wiped.\nthe bed had like a $20 matress and the toilet seat had cigarette burn marking along with a complimentary pubic hair and screwed loosely to the bowl.\nThe wifi internet is slower than my cell phone in 3G mode. If you want acceptable speed you have to pay for it.\nThe Brenda lady in the front is absolutely useless. Get everything on paper. Her word means nothing.\nI'm glad I left the place and went to best western 10 min after checking in. \nAnd got charged for the 3 days and useless Priceline( fake reviews of place) didn't do jack.\nAnd a message to kylie's \""realistic comment\"". How does remodeling the place in the future make for a realistic stay today at extended stay America? \nIt's amazing what people write for money. Absolutely no shame.\n\nThis place. Is a health hazard and I will be notifying the department of health."
1,"I'll admit up front Liberty Market is my all time favorite restaurant, and I love it.  Spent a lot of time and money there.  They even allowed us to have our small rehearsal dinner for our wedding there and it was FANTASTIC.\nPros: everything.  Food is great--ALWAYS.  People are great--ALWAYS.  They are friendly, attentive and enjoy being alive.  My favorite dish, the salmon BLT... HIGHLY recommend it.  It's fabulous.  Breakfast is also GREAT here.\nOnly thing you could complain about is it gets really busy, but that's what happens to good restaurants.\nThis is a must-visit restaurant... might become your favorite too!"
1,"Best Hotel i have stayed in Vegas!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n\n1. Got it via Priceline over Valentine's long weekend, much cheaper than Venetian, Palazzo, etc\n\n2. No wait at all during check in, I tried the 20$ front desk tip, it did not work, but it seemed like they were quite full for the long weekend.\nWe went to the Bellagio later for some shopping and frankly LOLed at their check in line, it must had been more than 40 minutes of wait.\n\n3. The room was huge!!!  Two Queen beds, separate living room area, additional bathroom. Huge tub!!  and the best bath robes i have ever used.  YOU SHOULD TRY THEM!!!!! I wanted to buy one but  my Chinese Cheapassness regained control as I saw the price tag at 129$\n\n4. Service was excellent and personal, they always address me by my last name. \n\nI will definitely stay here again."
0,"This place has got to win the award for having \""the most number of bias votes\"".  Food may be made fresh in their kitchen, as they claim, but its all cheap ingredients ordered from US Foods/Sysco!  Pancakes tasted like yuck and were very small, texture was awful, looked unpleasant.  Anyone in the city who really knows what good food tastes like and looks like wouldn't dare give this place above 3 stars; even if the earth was about to end. My Filipina mother wanted to slap me across the face when I brought her here.  She said the food looks like \""tae\"" (poop) and reminds her of old diner food."
0,"First let me say that I LOVE Chipotle.  Absolutely LOVE it.  However the location on South End is absolutely abysmal.  After going there just now at 8:15 on a Thursday night I finally realize that I need to write a review of this bastard of a Chipotle restaurant.\n\nEver since this location opened I've been appalled at how slow the staff is.  The first Chipotle restaurant I visited with regularity was in Falls Church, VA (DC area) and I was amazed at how a line out the door during lunch would process in 5 minutes.  Same case with the location in Crystal City (Arlington) near my job at the time.\n\nThe staff at South End are slow and beyond discombobulated.  There were 4 people on the front line tonight and 3 on the back line.  Everyone had to wait for black beans to be brought up to the line, and then everyone had to wait for chicken to be brought on the line.  WTF???\n\nWhen I got home tonight and opened my bag of chips a lot of them were greasy and soft, i.e. not cooked long enough.  This restaurant blows, I wish it would close down so I will no longer forget to go to the location on Providence."
0,Walgreens is Walgreens:  they have stuff you need and it's convenient. \n I want to write this to warn you of the growing homeless population that seems to live outside of this location.  I honestly feel bad for people that are stuck in this situation but begging just makes me feel uncomfortable.  Not a day goes by that I shop here and am pestered with requests for money.  The thing is that I don't really carry cash ever so I feel bad for not having any but also feel violated for being requested to shell out my hard earned cash to someone that is setting up camp outside a drug store and speaking low and incoherently and walking towards you and your car.  Gives me the creeps.
1,Great fabulous restaurant! Love the chai tea and sticky mango rice!! Should enjoy a set of pho here and also the fried rice! A lot to explore and I will definitely come back!
0,"I hate myself every time I wind up shopping here. Having to lock up my purse, indifferent staff, high prices....  plus they carry very little sterling and charge through the nose for what they do have."
0,"It's not that great. We got the Korean bbq plate, snow crab legs, mussels and two lbs of crawfish, mellow and crackin. There was just so much gooey seasoning that I couldn't really taste the food underneath. The Korean bbq was really good though. \n\nEverything is given to you in a bag and you just make a mess all over the table with the shells, which was a little unappealing to me. The seasoning was just a gooey, slimy mess dumped over everything, crackin wasn't very spicy, and mellow was pretty bland. I wish I had just gotten everything plain. I'm actually contemplating going home and rinsing all my leftovers off. \n\nAnyway, our waitress was a really sweet girl, but I don't feel like she actually knew how to be a waitress. I also felt a little uneasy as the owner stood behind the bar watching me throughout the entire meal as if I were stealing something. \n\nIn all, I don't think I will come back again, and if I do, I will be sure to order everything plain."
1,"Great coffee, great food, and great pastries! In such a small town, it is such a pleasure to have such a great locally owned coffee shop. Definitely stop in if you live in CG, or if you are just rolling through. You will be treated well, and leave with some great food."
0,"It is one thing to encounter a problem, that is unavoidable.  The issue is when the attempted solutions are so slow-in-coming and completely worse alternatives to the extant issue(s).  The staff at T&T are abysmal to the point of being comically bad, the bloody bed, falling mirror, missing mirror, plugged sink and general disarray of the suite and casino all combined to make a shockingly bad experience.  \n\nThis was my first opportunity to make a trip to Vegas for fun and I can say that I enjoyed my myriad business stays far more than this personal stay entirely due to Luxor and its staff.\n\nI understand they are being acquired/refurb'd by MGM, but this is supposed to be an area of world-class operations; with all the potential the unique layout provides and the luxury of having some measure of liquidity, the maintenance and operations Heads should all suffer the proverbial roll.\n\nI will be making a concerted effort to share my terrible experiences in detail with as many parties as possible; not due to the horrific experience itself, but owing entirely to the manner of their reaction after being informed."
1,"My girlfriend and I are big fans of this place. We've been here many times and keep coming back for a reason.  The food is generally very good (the crab rangoon is the best I've ever had) and:\n\n1. The portion sizes are well above average\n2. The prices are well below average (so much so we order a bunch of food to just take home with us)\n3. Our server (Theresa) is a blast once she gets to know you and you get her laughing.\n\nI'll give them that fifth star because though I won't claim every dish is the best I've ever had, those other places cost about %50 more.  And if you can't tell already, I'm a big fan of value."
0,Horrible customer service. Lines were so long and only 2 people working the registers.
1,"Famished, after a dizzying 25 minute of detours an endless sea of orange cones which are so endearing to inhabitants of Montreal, I luckily spotted a cluster of food trucks near Place du Canada and decided to stop by Zoe's Food Truck for a quick bite. Greeted by energetic owner Zoe Dalakas herself I was faced with the difficult decision between today's choice of jerk chicken or lamb sloppy joe pita sandwich. Zoe quickly convinced me to try messy and flavorful lamb pita - definitely ht the spot! \n\nWith over 14 years of experience in the food business from kitchen to management to catering, the city should be proud of the passion and entrepreneurship of this woman restaurateur who brings us freshly prepared Mediterranean inspired meals.\n\nDo stop by and get to know Zoe and her crew, you will be impressed and perhaps inspired by their passion to start your own food truck! \n\nNote: Keep your eyes peeled for an important announcement."
0,This was the first time and probably the last time going to Dickey BBQ. I heard some good commits so I tried it. The ribs were dry and the potatoes casserole tasted like boxed mash potatoes and the green bean and bacon was just bland.
1,"The best sashimi in the valley.  I like the relaxed atmosphere here and not feel rushed to complete my meal.  Best make reservations if you plan on a weekend night out.  Better yet, get there when they open and enjoy happy hour beer pricing."
1,"The rooms are average. They look like every other place in Vegas except with different theming. That's not a bad thing, because generally the rooms at the hotel/casinos are nice, it's just that it doesn't stand out for me. What did stand out for me is the pool area. It's like a freaking amusement park out there complete with wave pool, waterslides, and lazy river. If I had kids or for that matter wanted kids, this would be the place to stay at."
1,"Went here with my In-Laws who were craving good Chinese. So my friends at work recommended Baoding, and I decided to take a chance and go. Boy am I glad we did! Authentic Chinese? Not so sure. Yummy? You bet! \n\nMy Father-in-law had the wonton soup, and he raved at the complexity and depth of the broth. The potstickers were good, just wish they were a LITTLE more crispy. But they were very tasty....just picking. The veggie egg rolls were yummy too.\n\nWe ordered 4 full entrees, and threw in their Singapore noodles to make it 5. I've got to say that EVERYTHING was very tasty! The dishes that featured Chicken was REAL chunks of Chicken, not 90% breading with a tad of Chicken. Had their Tangerine beef which was good, but I would like to see a tad LESS Tangerine bits in the dish. Tasty nonetheless. General Tao's was very yummy too.\n\nAll in all, a VERY tasty meal in a town generally lacking good Chinese (except for Dragonfly off Park Road which is equally yummy).\n\nDefinitely will return to try other tasty morsels!"
0,"MOSTLY FULL PRICE MEALS \n\nVERY LIMITED TWO DOLLAR SAMPLES \n\n\n\n\n\nTo prevent choking hazards water should be provided.\n\nParking lot was unnecessarily muddy.\n\n\n Food Shows should held in convention centers.\n\nHad hopes of sampling different trucks, purchased one $10 meal that we didn't care for so we trashed it and went out for a nice lunch. Happy that we arrived and left early lines were still OK."
0,"I live here and have for about two years, and can't wait to get out if here!\nThe water is turned off with no notice, come home from work wanting to shower or do dishes and can't, and never know when it will be turned back on.. Kids are everywhere which is fine until they tear apart the bushes and trees, throw rocks at your windows. \nWe got a notice on all of our doors talking about the noise complaints going on and to make sure us and our guest follow the rules and respect everyone.  90% of the time the noise and fighting between adults is someone part of the maintenance guys family.. Don't tell me and  the residents to be respectful when you hire someone and house them here , that can't do it! I'm so done with them place and the noise and constant yelling ."
1,Busy place but amazing atmosphere!
0,"This used to be one of my favorite hang out places with friends and family. However went there recently for my parents anniversary and was very disappointed. The wine selection is still good priced higher than I recall.  The menu had changed and in addition to removing all the flatbreads and several other favorites, the prices were also considerably higher. The apple and fig app and the butternut squash soup were tasty but $9 for a cup of soup and half a (burned) grilled cheese? - come on. We ordered two different pasta dishes and the pasta was totally clumped together.  Salads were overdressed as well and apple tart was a small hard disk of something with minced apple on it.  All in all way overpriced now for the quality of food and mediocre service. I unfortunately will need to find a new place to go."
0,"Ok, here's the thing.. I like Icehouse ok.  I've met my husband there for lunch several times.  I've just not been wowed by the two big things I look for in a dining establishment.  Food and service.\n\nThe food is ok.  I can't say I've had anything that's really bad, but nothing really memorable, either.  Once, the buttermilk fried chicken was super good, but on a repeat visit, it was tough and the gravy was watery.\n\nAs for service, I've not been impressed at all.  I've only ever seen female waitstaff, but they never smile, or try to convey that they're remotely interested that anyone is there.  It makes for a rather boring experience, in my opinion.  I'm not saying they need to sit down and ask for my life story, but at least smile.\n\nI'm not saying I won't go back, I probably will, but this place is way down on my list of places I would enjoy frequenting."
0,"Over rated and over priced! Totally not worth any wait or the $$$$\n\nWhen it come to buffets... I am not a rookie; just FYI\n\nSorry Bacchanal, I really want to LOVE you, and I am so sad that I did not fall for you.  \n\nThe buffet is really pricey, even during brunch.  I am am spending about $110 for two, I expect the crab legs not to have ice all over and NOT looking dirty (Wynn The Buffet offer the best crab legs). The Asian food were weak. The sushi wasn't appetizing AT ALL and did not have many fish options; I had some and didn't care for it after two piece. The ramen soup was a waste of calories (I didn't finish the small bowl-- thank goodness).\n\nTheir dessert bar absolutely did not impress me. In fact, I didn't even bother getting anything there--- and that NEVER happens for me. \n\nTheir meat line was long and I am guessing this place is more for carnivores.  I didn't eat any meat because I hit buffets to eat seafood to get my money worth.  So I can't bash this place for their meat buffet.\n\nVegas buffets are like politics.  Everyone has their own favorite and you can't change their minds."
1,"Armandos...our new go-to Mexican joint!!  The Muchacaka burrito and the Huevos Ranchero burrito were simply delicious!\n\nThe manager checked with me prior to leaving on a take away order to make sure everything was in order......excellent excellent customer service.\n\nI have read some of the negative reviews on Armando's and I am left scratching my head especially by the 1 star review on 4/1/2011......A very mindless and naive review....if your going to rip someones business then take the time to tell them what needs to be worked on.\n\nThe hot sauce is very tasty, very spicy and is fairly vinegary which was a refreshing change.  The flour tortillas are the kind that are a bit translucent from all that great lard used in the making of......"
1,"I had a manicotti plate w/ an Italian salad and toast to top it off- it was a truly delightful meal... Definitely well worth the drive.. Food is delicious, like always- must run in the family. Not only that, the staff was very accommodating and  helpful.  Would recommend 100%."
0,"I tried and tried to reach out to them to have them assist with a simple issue, but it was nearly impossibe to get them to call us back. My parents live in Cave Creek and needed some help so we tried to use these guys because they're local.  Fortunately for them they must be really busy because we called several times and only received one call back.  Steve left a message for us, and we literally called back just a few moments later and it went to voicemail again.  \n\nAnyhow, after not hearing back we were forced to call the Geek Squad and they helped us out.  Just a thought...  This is an area where many of the residents just want a live person to answer.  Just a bit old fashioned I suppose."
0,"I wish I could give this piece of garbage a negative star but it might be the worst place in Arizona. Lots of disgusting people who feel you up in the dance floor, terrible service, the worst music. And apparently they think they are hot stuff in GLENDALE ARIZONA. Yes, they actually kicked out paying customers for wearing a hat. I didn't know we were in gang territory.  Save yourself the STDs and bedbugs. I hope this place burns down."

I just do not understand the reviews raving about the sushi here!  Once again, the fish we had was of mediocre quality at best.  Maybe I'm just missing something here since it seems like the regular customers are able to command the best quality fish (or at least it certainly looked a lot better than what we had), but the fish just isn't all that fresh and the service is consistently lackluster.  We sat at the sushi bar and literally had to flag down the waitress to get our drinks refilled.  We had some Hamachi and Maguro nigiri, neither of which were impressive and a couple of rolls, one of which was the Negi Toro roll that I had to force myself to eat given the off taste it had.  We'd actually assumed that the sushi chef had forgotten about the Maguro nigiri and were ready to leave, but as soon as we flagged down the waitress, he presented the two pieces to us, nearly a half an hour after the last roll he'd served us when the place was less than half full.\n\nI find it strange to hear how many other reviews mention the number of Asian people they see eating here and somehow manage to draw the conclusion from that fact that this is a great place.  That would seem to follow the logic of visiting Europe and seeing a McDonald's filled with Americans and drawing the conclusion that McDonald's is a top-notch American restaurant.  The point here is that not everyone is discerning regardless of whether they are eating their native fare and I find it difficult to believe that this would be considered a quality sushi restaurant among discerning Japanese diners given how much better quality sushi is available in the Valley.  Our last visit to Hiro will be our last and for anyone looking to find fresh, high quality sushi in Scottsdale, I would highly recommend trying Yume at the Scottsdale Promenade."
0,"Our waitress was wonderful, lemon drop martini was great and the pretzel bread was super tasty. However, the logistics and response from management was terrible.\n\n We arrived on a Monday night without reservation and told only available table is in the bar/lounge area. There was no offer to put our name on a list in case a dining table became available. The bar tables are small for 2 people to sit at, let alone the 4 in our party. The 2 appetizers hardly fit on the table surface. When we noticed that another party in the bar area that arrived 20 minutes after us, sat for 5 minutes and then were shown to a table in the dining room that had been available since our arrival 25 minutes prior - time to leave for us!\n\nFood (appetizers) were okay. The vanilla shrimp tasted like something that I could get any state fair - heavily battered and deeped fried. The calamari was good.\n\nOverall the prices were over the top high, the managers handling of the seating situation was one of the worst ever - I would go back for a martini and a bread stick and sit at the bar only!"
1,What an amazing steak.  First time I ate at this chain was in Pittsburgh and the food was the same amazing taste in Los Angeles.  Made you feel welcome and not just another head count.  You must go if you have the chance.  Great experience!
1,"A great haircut, and always a fun time!!  Bella and Frank can do a flat top to rival Pete's in Austin (I miss Frank).  These folks there are like extended family.   A-1+  in all categories."
1,"Interesting that this show opened on May 12 and no one had added it to Yelp before now. Oh I know why. Because it's at the Riviera - a casino that always seems like a ghost town.\n\nMy friend had free tickets through one of the many seat filler type sites that keep popping up left and right. So with the caveat that I saw it for free, I must say that I rather enjoyed it. I think something can be said for these small shows that have an intimate theater setting. Being so close to the stage and with such a small audience size, you just feel more connected to the performers.\n\nMake no mistake. There is nothing new here. You've seen all of these types of acts somewhere before. But that doesn't take away from their entertainment value. It's only a small on-stage cast of about nine people. By the end of the show, I really felt an appreciation for what they just put on display. At barely over one hour, I think it's just the right length too.\n\nOh I have to mention this. I swear that one of the male performers reminds me of like an Asian David Bowie. I'm thinking it's the makeup."
0,"The food is actually pretty good here. I would give the place 3.5-4 stars on the food alone.  However, I gave it 2 stars because the service is downright horrible.  I mostly order delivery and whenever I call they seem pissed that I'm calling. This could be a great place if they would improve the customer service."
0,"Analogy for this hotel\nExterior is to fancy as Room is to Ugly.\n\nThis is a really outdated hotel here on the strip.Be aware that this hotel was built in 1999.Since then,they never renovated their level entry rooms,even up to 2014.Really ugly hotel!\nI didn't like it because of its cheap furniture.This is one of the cheap European-themed hotels.They didn't have a flat-screen television in 2012(For Cheapest room)they use the huge boxed CRT televisions.EVEN LUXOR(BAD HOTEL)HAS A FLAT SCREEN TELEVISION.

0,"I used to be a big fan of The Buffet at the Wynn, with its insane variety of meaty goodness, vegan and vegetarian options for those who want to live a healthier lifestyle, and a room packed full of desserts that always made me feel a little like Willie Wonka. I used to tell people it was the best buffet on the Vegas Strip, but I am no longer a fan.  \n\nMy last visit there was just before Labor Day weekend, and was very disappointing.  \n\nThe veal short rib was the only dish that was truly exceptional, while everything else I sampled was just so lackluster: the fried chicken was on par with the kind my local grocery store sells by the greasy boxful, the Cajun pork loin was flavorless and didn't inspire me to Zydeco, and the sweet pea risotto was bland and a little too crunchy for my liking.\n\nEven my favorite go-to desserts seemed to have been replaced with piteous knock-offs that left a chilling \""Invasion of the Dessert Snatchers\"" vibe in the air. The cheesecake pops and cake pops I once loved there were now store-bought marshmallows that were coated in a humdrum icing and violently impaled on a stick. The gelato that was once bustling with exciting flavors was now deferential and hesitant.         \n\nThe service, too, was seriously lacking. While water and drink orders are often frequently refilled at most buffets (and restaurants), our waiter's appearances could be best described as spectral: he showed up at the start of the meal and was never seen or heard from again. If he has 40 years younger, I would have initiated an Amber Alert.  \n\nSadly, no one came by at any time to pick up the pile of used dishes that were quickly accumulating on our table either. It got so ridiculous that we decided to clear the table ourselves and place our many dishes on the empty, four-seater across from us. Even sadder, a lone diner was seated at that very table shortly thereafter, with everyone oblivious to the Jenga tower of plates and unappetizing leftovers erected diagonally across from her.           \n\nOn the up side, many of the diners seemed to be enamored with the giant crab legs that were pouring endlessly out of the kitchen. Plates were filled two and three feet high with these savory crustaceans that was a high point of this buffet. These crab-loving guests tended to ignore the other offerings available to them. Were they in the know? Or were they there just for the crab?\n\nThe immense popularity of the crab leg station and the sheer volume being consumed by some diners who seemed almost unhinged in their pursuit to up the levels of Omega-3s in their systems seemed to be the \""raison d'\u00eatre\"" for this buffet.\n\nMaybe this is the reason that the Wynn has just given up? Sure, the presentation and vibrant colors of the many meals at each station really stood out, appealed to the eye, and made me want to try everything. But it almost felt like the offerings outside of the crab legs were just there for show, along with the inedible flower arrangements and the decorative flourishes that adorn this dining hall and provide it with its atmosphere."
0,"I haven't been to this place  in a VERY LONG time. Years ago, this was a regular spot. I remembered the room was dark, food was good, and the infamous pole in the lady's room. So on a recent cold winter night, while Melissa & I were trying to figure out where to eat, knowing this is her regular spot, I said Alexander Michael's!\n\nParking is always a challenge. Luckily we got a spot down the road off the side street. However the darkness is a little creepy... I feel like I need a buddy system to park there (find a friend, hold hands, and walk together like we were in grade school).  The embiance was perfect for a cold night with the lit candles and closely spaced seatings. We got a table very quickly, but that's as much service as we got that night. There wasn't any incident. The waitress wasn't rude, but she just wasn't there. For a small place like this, it should be pretty easy to take good care of every table.  \n\nThe food was ok as well. I ordered the london broil sandwich with the soup as side. I forgot the \""crab\"" soup was made with fake crab, which I think should be illegal to be called crab. My sandwich had enough meat on it that I pretty much just ate all the meat, which was average. Tender enough, not too much taste to it.  I guess for $9.50 I couldn't complain. Years later, I felt that their menu was limited, a little overpriced, and seems to be lacking a spark in general with food and service.\n\nI will give it a 2nd chance and visit again, maybe not anytime soon."
0,Don't shop here.  sych!
1,"My friend referred me to this Company. I called them, set me up a schedule and got it done quick. \n\nI called other companies but they charge more. I had a great deal here and the service was fast and clean.\n\nI strongly recommend this company to everyone who needs auto glass repair and replacement in Vegas."
0,"What a let down! Pizza was 15min late from the 40-45m pickup wait, staff was blah, and when I got home to try the pizza... Totally let down... And ps - the angry crayon written signs all over the place are soooo tacky."
0,"This used to be one of my favorite spots but lately it's been dirty almost every time I visit. Having been a barista, I know you can get slammed and get behind on the housekeeping but I have witnessed several times that employees seem oblivious to the mess on the floor, under tables, on chairs and around the condiment bar. \n\nThe staff is always friendly and I still like to go but it's weird to sit and enjoy my java while looking at all the debris on the floor. I also inquired of one barista regarding what kind of milk they used, specifically asking about rgbh or rbst. She said they just buy the run-of-the-mill milk like the kind at Safeway etc. I will stick with the java & espresso - don't want no hormones or steroids in my latte!"
1,"After reading some of the reviews about Cylco I had to come back to write my own. Cyclo was highly recommended by several colleagues and I had to try it for myself to see what the buzz is about. \n\nFirst off, for all you who come from somewhere else...Like \""The Bay\"" or \""New York\"" or wherever you come from...? Just as a reminder you currently live in Arizona! I'm from Louisiana where there are also a lot of great Vietnamese restaurants, but who cares...I live here. \n\nMy most cherished dish here is the X.L. Beef Noodle Pho Soup. It includes braised brisket, rare sirloin, rice noodles and all the fixings so be prepared with a huge bowl if you get this to-go. If you think 12 bucks is too much for this bowl, go to some fast food franchise. The location is relatively small and intimate with ambient lighting in the evening. Additionally this is a BYOB establishment so feel free to bring your own wine or spirits...Try that at other Vietnamese restaurants!\n\nJustine is mind-blowing and awesome in her own way! She's the owner and also works at the establishment. She's straight forward and not afraid to speak her mind so she's not for the weak hearted. When dining in, she makes her way to every table to ensure your dish suits your desire. \n\nI hope this was informative and most importantly...Enjoy your meal."
1,"What a hidden gem. Always loved the outdoor taco stand while shopping in the strip...but go downstairs and a surprise awaits. The decor is genuine and interesting. A variety of very comfortable, quality seating choices (high tops, long communal-like tables and traditional seating) peek into windows where tortillas are being made on an old-school conveyor. \n\nFood is authentic and fresh, high quality ingredients. We have tried all the meats now and each was seasoned very tastily and expertly! A full bar lines one wall... so I imagine its lively on weekends!\n\nFrom a California transplant, this is the best Mexican food in Pittsburgh."
1,I loved this place. The chilaquiles were to die for and they provided excellent service. Here's hoping the return with a liquor license.
0,"This used to be called Extreme Sushi and recently changed ownership.  I would have given Extreme Sushi 3-4 stars but under the new ownership it's essentially the same food (there are some new menu items and some have been removed) except that the prices have gone up and the portion size has gone down.  This is not a $14 per specialty roll kind of place.  The quality and portion size just isn't there. Since this is the only sushi place in Southern Highlands, I think I'll be driving an extra 10 mins to go elsewhere for my sushi now."
0,"I would definitely suggest coming to the Mandalay Bay pool if you're with your family or kids. The crowd is much younger and more family oriented. That being said, I wasn't extremely impressed with Mandalay Bay's pool. All of the hype from the lazy river, to the intricately connected pools, to the wave pool I expected more. We reserved a cabana for the day so it was nice that we had our own space to relax and to not worry about us leaving our area without our belongings getting stolen or our chairs getting taken."
0,"This place is not the business! The drinks are not even that great. My friend got a watermelon slush and it tastes so fake and literally looks like pepto dismal. The coffee is OK but they put way too much ice in the drinks where ice is up to the way top. Service is not good, the girl that was taking my order was giving attitude. I won't be coming here again. The one in California is way better."
0,"It has a great atmosphere, but food is lacking. The service was slow but they are still in training so I understand. I ordered a french dip sandwich that looked like it was served on a hot dog bun. It was hard to see it under all the onion rings it was buried under. The chips and spinach dip was good, but not enough dip to the amount of chips. They seem to pile on the sides and go light on the main dish. \nThis would be a good place to grab a beer and watch the game, but not to sit down and eat."
0,"Nathan's $7 Cheeseburger Has Really Got Nothing Much More On A $1 McDouble\n\nSITREP\n\nIt certainly has nothing On TWO $1 McDoubles.

And then he said (again) it would be out in \""5 mins\"".\n\n*Shrug* Sometimes you don't win.\n\nAnd sometimes therr are just times you feel like an explanation of logic & common measurements of time, would have more impact if shared with a brick wall.\n\nTHE LOWDOWN\n\n2-Stars at least for the burger, cause it didn't suck.  But cost, time & attitude *supernova* the remaining stars."
1,"For a steakhouse in Las Vegas, you can't beat Circus Circus for a great value. At first look, the $40 filet is pricey but that includes a salad or soup, side dish, and entree.  If you went anywhere else, it would be the same price or more. Good service, great food, and old school atmosphere. Love it and will return again. \n\nThe wine list is comprehensive and a good wine can be found at any price point.\n\nOut cab driver said after we mentioned that's where we ate \""it's like walking through the ghetto to get to the palace.\"" Yep, that about sums it up."
1,"I didn't have any if the - experiences as other yelpers. It's 1am and my very nice waitress Elizabeth just cleared my plate. Got the steak and eggs for $6.99. My boyfriend, also. He ordered rare and myself medium rare. (Elizabeth did ask both steak and eggs preference for preparation) they were as ordered. Hot and delicious. I added some salt because I like kidney failure. The usual standard toast and hash-browns, as expected. I don't know how anyone could complain with what we experienced. My water cup was refilled before it was empty, we didn't wait more than 2 minutes... Two! And our check was dropped as we ate. Loved it. Very satisfying after walking allllll day and having pizza for lunch! Thanks Flamingo :D"
0,This place is disgusting. Google Tao Beach and water quality. You'll see that this place has one of the worst conditions. I was sad to see that my friend got an allergic reaction to the water due to all it's chemicals and impurities. The service also sucks here. Avoid at all costs!!!
0,"We  have been eating at Carlos Obrien's since they where on 16th street next to the bank.  It appears they have taken their eye off the ball.  The food today was flat dry and tasteless.  Not like the old Carlos.  \nThe kids waiting on tables where also very slovenly, argumentative and really  to busy visiting to wait on customers."
1,"Awesome popcorn and great service. We stopped by this location for the 1st time on Saturday and we're very impressed with the popcorn options and the great service we received from the guy working. I asked him to seal the tin we purchased, and since my husband wanted to snack on the popcorn, he gave my husband a small cup of popcorn. It was very sweet!"
0,"We've been trying to find good Chinese food in Pittsburgh forever and trusted the reviews on Zen's only to be disappointed once again. We ordered delivery, which arrived 30 minutes late. Thankfully, before eating it, I cut some up for my 1 year old. This allowed me to see the raw/under cooked chicken! Both the sesame and general tso chicken. My California roll was HOT from being packaged with my meal. We decided to call gh and not risk eating anything. Zen's wound up calling us, and tried to tell us that they cut the chicken bigger than normal, and that's why it was under cooked. That may be, but from my time in the food industry, I know that everything leaving a kitchen should be temped before serving. Raw chicken can kill someone and shut down a business. They also told me that their California rolls were meant to be served hot.  What we did taste (some sauce, the egg roll, a bite of rice) was mediocre at best, so needless to say, our search for good Chinese in the Burgh continues."
1,"I've been coming to El Burrito since I was in Middle School and it's still one of my favorite homegrown Mexican restaurants in Las Vegas.\n\nI've never really had a bad experience or bad food at this place because I pretty much stick to three things on the menu because each of those items are so good that I just never decided to branch out and try anything else.\n\nThe complimentary chips and salsa are always an awesome start to the meal. I usually follow that up with the Noodle Soup. It's pretty salty, but it'll warm you up on a cool night and it tastes great.\n\nI usually get one of three entree plates every time I go, which comes with the aforementioned soup.\n\n1) Two Chicken Burritos w/ Red Sauce\n2) Two Tamales\n3) Carne Asada\n\nEach of the items comes with the typical fixings, rice and beans and whatnot. Each of the items are equally tasty, and if you get the two burrito plate you will DEFINITELY have leftovers!\n\nI usually cap the meal off with the sopapillas, which are cinnamon-sugar covered pieces of dough that are absolutely delicious. \n\n:) I highly recommend this place, as a loyal customer for most of my life."
1,"The antithesis of Starbucks...independent coffee shop at its finest.  Bungalow with slacker types on Macs, board games, and dudes with dreadlocks on their fourth quadruple espresso latte for the day (and it is only 1:30 p.m.).  Americano was unbelievably smooth, made me swear off corporate coffee for almost a week (until I had no choice)."
0,"Been at this store before, but today called to check for a product availability and was met with very rude staff. \nI was put on hold for about 10 minutes and when I finally decided to hung up and call back I spoke to another girl that was pretty rude as well. \nNeed a product from there so will go for convenience but won't visit again."
0,"I went here with a friend to use a Groupon for a gel manicure and a spa pedicure. I knew it was a school going into the appointment. My issues with the place are as follows:\n1. The students there were very unprofessional. They talked about their personal lives, talked to each other, and just were generally inappropriate for a business setting. Their supervisor overheard everything and did not say anything. This is pretty disturbing since some of these girls stated that they were going to work at places like Dolce in a few weeks. \n2. The gel manicure was billed as 'unchippable' by the people at this salon, but my friend had one whole nail peel off the day after the manicure and my nails chipped 2 days after. This is especially annoying because it is difficult to remove the polish that remained on my nails, so they just look bad. \n3. The massage was pretty weak. \n4. They don't have enough carts for pedicures, so I had to put my foot up on my 'pedicurist's' lap...that's a bit odd. \n5. It was difficult to make an appointment here. I had to call several times and leave messages and wait for them to call me back. \n\n\nOverall, I would not return to this place, even at the cheap price. I guess you get what you pay for."
0,This H&M location is basically a more mature version of Forever 21. If you are looking for basic pieces such as cheap leggings and skinny jeans this store is great. Besides that notthing else seems worth the price for the crapy quality. My biggest gripe is the customer service. They seem to hired people that have never handled a cash register much less worked with the public. Slow doesn't begin to describe the cashiers.
1,"I won't make this long or judge the people there because there are of course \""those people\"".  \n\nOverall a pretty decent LA Fitness.  Has racquetball, which all don't, pool, basketball etc.  Pretty good selection of free weights and machines.  Taking from other reviews they have remodeled and it shows.  Is pretty new and have two people for about $45 a month.  Pretty good value especially coming from Chicago. \n\nI'll take it and suggest. Another benefit is selection on locations."
0,"I was really excited to try a fun workout routine that would also do some damage. I showed up with a friend and two other girls who had made a reservation like the groupon specified. Well imagine our surprise when the trainer wasn't there. We made contact with him and he said to ask another trainer to get us started and he would be there soon.  You should know now, that he never showed up. Secondly, the other trainer is technically a part of anther company that shares the garage. So the poor guy was stuck with clients that didn't even pay for his services. But he was willing to keep us busy with running drills, a little weights and such, but nothing boxing related. (again not his fault) he was great. But I definitely returned my groupon because the 1on1 boxing instructor definitely didn't bother to honor his own conditions. I even called him the next day to confirm that he would be there and he said of course he would. So I mentioned that I was a part of the group from that morning when he didn't show up and he said \""oh...well you were trained by (other trainers name).\"" I thought that was a poor excuse."
0,"I was very excited to check this place out...anything to make Phoenix a better place to live. But it was very disappointing. We made a reservation which they lost. The receptionist at the front desk was unapologetic and acted helpless. Our waitress was terrible. A young Russian girl with short blond hair who didn't smile, didn't make eye contact, and didn't want to take our order. I guess it was the end of her shift because before we could complain, Nicole came on shift. She was the best thing about our whole experience. She was prompt and friendly. The manager, Buddy, did come over to apologize about our reservation, apparently the girl who took our request made it for the wrong day...he stated this was not the first time this had happened. BTW we received nothing complimentary for our inconvenience and their lack of customer service. Don't waste your money...go to a real bowling alley. Also, the bathrooms were sad."
1,"Nice hotel in downtown Phoenix.  I stayed here for one night for a work conference.  Comfortable and clean room.  I took advantage of their gym which has several cardio equipment, weight machines, free weights, as well as an area for stretching.  On the same floor as the gym, there is a pool and lounge chairs.  No complimentary breakfasts but there is a cafe on the ground floor that serves Starbucks coffee, oatmeal, breakfast burritos and the like.  There's also a more upscale restaurant which I didn't take advantage of.  Also on the ground floor is a bar which served up a tasty apple mojito.\n\nOther food options are available across the street in an outdoor plaza area which included greek, tex-mex, sushi, and another cafe.  The one thing that I was surprised at was how isolated the streets seemed to be considering the hotel is located in downtown Phoenix.  I was there on a Monday evening with a baseball game going on and ASU within walking distance yet there was barely a soul on the street."
1,"Good solid car wash, polite employees.  They scrub down your car before it goes through the automatic wash, then they towel dry and wash the tires which was nice.  Also have free vacuums you can use after or before you do the wash which is killer.  Only 4 stars because it's CASH ONLY."
1,"Bought a groupon for this place.  $10 for $20 worth of food.  Went on a Saturday morning and it wasn't too busy.\n\nI ordered the half rack of ribs ($13.99) which came with six rib bones and two sides (I got sweet potato fries and coleslaw).  The ribs were tender and the fries were delicious.  The coleslaw, eaten by my fiance, was just okay.  He got the pulled pork sandwich ($5.99) and enjoyed it.  It was messy but good he said.  We shared a drink and wound up only having an additional $4 and change to pay on our bill.\n\nThis was a yummy lunch and the groupon made it even more awesome.  Worth a visit!"

1,"Walking in a desert wonderland...\n\nThe luminaries at the DBG are one of the best ways to get into the holiday spirit!  Big cozy coats, pretty lights, warm drinks, festive music.  \n\nI like that this event isn't super Christmassy - don't go expecting to hear Jingle Bells throughout the property or catch a glimpse of Santa, because you won't.  Although there are a lot of kids here, I feel like it could be boring for the younger ones, it is more of a romantic, adult night out. \n\nThere are a variety of musical acts - including some Christmas carolers and bell ensembles - but I am more attracted to the jazzy, bluesy ones!  I enjoy sitting back with a spiked drink and listening to some good, local music with my beautiful desert lit up all around. \n\nAs magical as this event feels, the price is steep - $25 per person.  For that price I wish there were a drink or small bites included."
1,"Call it Mediterranean or Greek food or whatever you like. The owner/ manager is Lebanese and this place has hands down the best Kabobs in Phoenix. To the Yelper complaining about the pita bread being fluffy- Sorry, but that's what you use for authentic Kabobs. Meat cut off of vertical skewers- again, these guys know what they are doing. I had the opportunity to have what are claimed to be the best Kabobs in Berlin, Germany ( yes, there are a lot of immigrants there) and these rank right up there. Add a manager who is hands on and  actually concerned that his customers are happy and you have a great place for fantastic food at a reasonable price."
0,"I did not enjoy my cupcake like I should have, although it was beautifully presented. I tried the birthday cake cupcake and it was just average, nothing special about it. I definitely want to give some more stars but it didn't satisfy my sweet tooth in any way. I am a dessert guru but this is not the place, cake is dr-dr-dry. Maybe next time I would try one of the chocolate cupcakes, if I go back."
0,"Worst fucking valet line ever. Even with a sign the lane is apparently \""not for valet\"". I see no valet drivers either even though the security guy told me valet is still open!\n\nAs for the casino, this is the creepiest hotel resort I have EVER been to on The Strip! Like the Circus Circus, it caters primarily to the hillbilly and redneck tourists. Anyone who is not missing all but their front two incisors are either passing by or headed to the rides and bungee jumps at the very top of the casino.\n\nOften you can gauge the quality of a hotel's clientele by the looks of the cocktail waitresses. If they look fucking old or octogenerian, and still wears the company-standard uniforms that shows WAY TOO MUCH (cover your fucking eyes!), then they probably cater to a group of gamblers that are mainly homeless on the penny slots. \n\nPersonally, I use this place as a convenient parking spot for First Friday. \n\nThe parking garage lanes are VERY confusing though. It's kind of like a very tightly wound maze that goes 20 stories up."
0,"I was so disappointed at this buffet. I don't eat seafood, so I can't speak for that. Very little choices and subpar quality for the price."
1,"This place shocked me.  Shadowed by the likes of Krung and Thai Style Noodle House, the advertisement of \""Thai and Chinese\"", and the funny name, this place needs more credit than it gets when it comes to really good Thai food.  In fact, I think its better than TSNH... that's right, I said it!  I wonder if the crowds of Thai customers that were there today during lunch would agree with me?\n\nWe ordered the pad see ew with pork, the \""sweetened\"" green curry with fish balls, and the mint chicken.  All were amazing dishes! \n\nThe pad see ew was simply perfect.  It had little red peppers and beans that were difficult to notice just by looking at the dish, but also added to the flavor.  This pad see ew had some awesome flavor!  The pork was well prepared, and the large chunks of Chinese broccoli were fresh and delicious.  If it weren't for the little, tiny bit of noticeable grease, I would say this is the best pad see ew I have had in a long time, and even then only Thai Grill and maybe Prommares make a better version of pad see ew.  \n\nThe mint chicken is a dish of minced chicken, and soy/oyster sauce.  It was perfectly spiced, and very yummy.  It was also just a tad bit greasy, but the flavor made this fact very forgiving.  With a side of white rice, the flavor of this dish flowed very well with the other things we ordered.\n\nThe \""sweetened\"" green curry with fish balls scared me at first.  I was afraid it would be too sweet.  However, the waitress promised me that it wasn't too sweet after she realized that isn't what I look for in curry.  To my astonishment, the curry here was really good.  The fish balls and bamboo were really nicely prepared, and the taste was very well balanced between sweet coconut, spice, and curry.  I actually loved it.  it is so hard to find a good curry, especially green curry, in Las Vegas, and Kung Fu pulls it off.\n\nWe will definitely be coming here again.  The food is generally a little bit greasy, but I am so impressed with the taste of this Thai food that this place is easily going on my list of Best Thai in Vegas... and it is going above TSNH!"
1,"My wife just recently delivered our new baby daughter, \""Abby\"".  The staff, nurses, and doctors at SW Medical were just absolutely awesome.  As part of our OB, we met with 3 doctors (Skinner, Kashap, and Schwartz).  All were amazing, friendly, and informative.  \n\nWhen we were told that my wife had to have a \""C-section\"", we chose doctor Paula Schwartz to perform the surgery.  This review is based on her work with us.\n\nTwo words - \""Absolutely AMAZING!!\""  Dr. Schwartz is so down to earth, easy going, informative, and just great to work with.  She made us comfortable, provided us with the information we needed, and kept us in the loop.  \n\nAs for the surgery, she did an amazing job with the surgery.  My wife's \""cut\"" was excellent and she healed perfectly.  I can not thank DOCTOR Schwartz enough.  If we could, we would definitely hug her.  Well deserved!!\n\nAs for the OB office, very clean, very courteous, and very professional.  We rarely waited more than 15 minutes.  Once we were in, the nurses were attentive, friendly, and helpful.\n\nThe only negative that I would say is that it was difficult to make appointments.  I guess they outsourced this and it is hard to get an exact date and time.\n\nOtherwise, everything was great."
1,"Fast, efficient service. We stopped by here after a few drinks and they were great. We ordered our food and when our dishes came our and asked ourselves 'what's this!?' Our waitress was right next to us to remind us of our choice in entree. Quality of food was superb. I would recommend this place and definitely come back again!!"
0,"Dirty location. 5 gas pumps were broken, 3 were tagged out of service. This location is poorly maintained."
1,"OMG!!! I love this place! I ate everything in one sitting!!! It was so good.  My best friend is Filipino and I love her moms cooking but I'm sorry, but hands down I will eat at this place everyday!  I will go to Vegas just eat here.  I don't know what I got but it was very delicious and I loved the ube dessert."
0,"Absolutely the worst pizza i've ever had. With all the local cheap late night options for delivery i have no idea how this place stays in business. It takes a lot or me to really dislike a place, but Gus's, your pizza makes me want to cry."
0,"I was so excited when they opened since I love Mediterranean and middle eastern food. And I live literary down the street. Unfortunately me and my husband had a bad experience. The service is horrible,  the cashier/hostess/waitress is the same lady who after taking your order and bringing your food, does not stop to offer more water or anything.  The food was served pretty fast, around 10 minutes,  but it seems like if it was cooked previously and heated in the microwave,  the meat was very dry. They give a huge portion of rice and a small portion of meat. And that is not all, after checking my bank account,  I found out they charged us 5 dlls more, I have the original receipt and our total after tax was $35.50 and they charged my credit card $42. I guess the cashier/server was not happy with our 4 dlls cash tip that we left for the bad service, so decided to charge an extra 5 dlls on our credit card. Check your debit/credit card, I am not joking!"
0,"I wish I had talked Zoe into Siu Wok...\nUgh.  Ok, this place is cheap.  That's always a plus.  We wanted take-out from the buffet.  You get a card (kinda like at Chino Bandito) and mark what you want from the buffet.  Hostess takes card to the buffet and fills your take-out box.  Ok, here is where she actually GETS stars.  My box was full.  Overloaded.  Always a plus, as Chinese take-out is always good the next day.  Lo Mein, sesame chicken, egg roll (she gave me 2!), beef with broccoli, some shrimp thing and BBQ pork ribs.  \n8.18 with tax for what has turned out (so far) to be 4 meals.  There is a complete lack of flavor for most of the dishes.  The only one that actually HAD flavor was the ribs.  The rest?  MEH.  I never use \""meh,\"" but in this case, it works.\nThere was only one packet of soy sauce in the bag.  No sweet and sour for my egg rolls.  The lo mein?  No flavor.  Shrimp thing?  Actually had shrimp in it, but, still, no flavor.\nI'm a bit pissed, because I had a real craving for Chinese food.  What I really got was Grandma making Chinese that Gramps could eat without feeling it the next day.\nMe, I'm not feeling this place at ALL.  \nThe only thing that got them stars was the size of the take-out portion and the price.  \nMEH."
1,"12 novembre 2012\nUn petit dimanche bien traquille. Je suis un habitu\u00e9 de ce petit coin asiatique toujours \u00e0 la hauteur de mes attentes. Une excellente cuisine g\u00e9n\u00e9reuse toujours \u00e0 la hauteur des origines chinoise fast-food bien connues par les qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois. Le service est parfois lent, et d\u00e9bord\u00e9 par la client\u00e8le, il faut donc choisir son heure de commande pour \u00e9viter les p\u00e9riodes trop achaland\u00e9es. En bout de ligne on y revient pour une fringale ou tout simplement pour se faire plaisir :-)\n\nNovember 12, 2012\nA nice smooth sunday. I'm used to buy take out from them, they 're always up to expectancy. An excellent and generous menu always in the line of traditionnal chinese fast-food well known by quebecers. The service is sometimes slow depending on the time of day, so you need to choose your time if you need your order fast. Bottom line is .... you always come back to it for a snak or just to make yourself happy :-)"
0,"I do most of my grocery shopping at Fresh & Easy, but that's a small place, so I tend to pick up what they don't have (or are out of) at this Fry's. It's close to my apartment which makes it easy to get to. However, it's close enough to a busy intersection at McDowell and Hayden, that if you go heavy traffic times, it's hard to get out of. The parking lot is also annoying to navigate through, and people tend to leave their carts all over the place. It would be nice if the employees did a better job of cleaning up those carts. \n\nIt's a decent enough supermarket. It's a good size, and tends to everything that I'm looking for in stock. Produce is a real hit or miss. Sometimes I pick up something and it expires in a day or two, other times it lasts a week or two. You just got to luck out and shop there when it's fresh. I think (like most grocery stores) Fry's gets its produce on Wednesdays and Fridays, so shop during the late afternoon on those days. \n\nThe store is clean, but nothing spectacular. It seems like other grocery stores in the area are trying to class up, but Fry's remains exactly what you'd expect it to look like. The class of shoppers kind of reflects that at this location. When compared to Fresh & Easy, the nearest Safeway, and even another Fry's a couple miles north, I tend to notice quite a few people with mullets here."
0,VERY disappointed. No ambiance. Ugly patio. Rude staff. The website menu shows a gluten free option but when I asked about it they seemed irritated. Food isn't great. Wine pours are small. This neighborhood needed a new restaurant/bar but this one isn't going to cut it.
1,"We literally have a computer graveyard in our garage at least 5 desktops, countless laptops and an iPad (SMH)...we didn't want to buy anymore so we decided to fix two laptops...hubs did a DIY replacing the screen to one himself...(he did a pretty good job!) the other laptop needed the adapter plug thingy fixed (I'm sooo not a techy). We are still pretty brand new to Las Vegas so we don't have any go to people to handle things like this. Hubs dropped the kids off at a nearby school and found this place...Well let me tell ya...they did a mighty fine job fixing it and debugging our laptop! They also added some software that works pretty awesome at keeping our laptop virus free :) They definitely know their stuff! I encourage you to bring your laptops and computers here to get fixed! Check-in and they might have an awesome deal available for you too!"
0,"Interesting experience at this location.  On July 6, 2013, I took my car in to have the breaks checked for possible replacement.  I was told it would be a while, so I left my vehicle.  After around an hour or so, I called back to inquire.  I was told by Ben \""I'm working up an estimate for you and I will call you back shortly.\""  Okay, 10 minutes later, I receive a call from Ben advising me that I need brake pads all the way around and my front rotors must be replaced.  I immediately inquired as to whether the rotors could be resurfaced.  I was told no, they are too thin.  Ben then quoted me a rate near $500 for this work. To his quote, I responded no and requested that he put my car back together, as I am coming to pick it up.  Ben then offers to put the brakes only all the way around for $200.  Again No, \""put my s@!t back together!\""  I call the Nissan dealer and inquire about the same type of work and was quoted $310 for new rotors on the front and brakes all the way around.  I pick up my vehicle from Ben and drive it down the street to the Nissan Dealer.  While there, the mechanic asked if I could wait to allow for a full inspection.  I agreed.  Approximately 30 minutes, or less, later the mechanic emerges and asks why I though I needed all this work.  I explained the above and he laughed and said \""No\"".  \""You will not need brakes for a while and the rotors in the front are only slightly bent.\""  The mechanic offered to resurface my rotors and deglaze the brakes for $100.  Yes BLANK STARE.  The mechanic proceeds to explain that my brakes are a 6 in the back and a 5 in the front.  BLANK STARE AGAIN.  At this point, I'm thinking \""I'm going to Yelp them.\""  Long and short, I will never use Meineke again because apparently their practice is to offer repairs that are not needed and that are over priced.  I wish I had gotten a written estimate from Ben because I would have certainly uploaded of photo of his listemate, I mean estimate to this Yelp..  That is extremely unethical.  I do not advise anyone use Meinke for their car care needs, even if it is only an oil change."
0,"I ordered take out of Tom Yum soup and Chilli Chicken, what a disappointment. None of these tasted good, Tom Yum soup was kinda disgusting."
0,"Great food, AWFUL CUSTOMER SERVICE.\nI called earlier today and got transfered three times. The server I talked to didn't speak spanish at all and she didn't seem to understand the dish names. Therefore, she placed the wrong order. When I called back to fix it, they refused to do so and hung up on me. Their server, Anthony, was REALLY RUDE and ask me if I was actually going to go because I was \""wasting his time\"". Extremely disrespectful.\n\nI'm really ashamed of peruvian restaurants with this horrible customer service and despiteful waiters. Food might be good, but definitely not worth it anymore."
0,"Nothing has gotten better here... Let me tell you I have NEVER had a complaint on me and I am rarley home. Well. my neighbors are upstairs and at 1 AM last night I called security because, they're noise level is out of this world and it scares my little one. I have made the office aware of this on several occasions... Well, today the office man Josh told me that the neighbor called complaining that I am noisey (keep in mind that I have never have a complaint and am never home) and told them my husbands alarm clock wakes him up. MY HUSBAND IS HEARING DISABLED. The nerve on these people!! And my \""dog is loud and scratches all day\"" I DONT HAVE A DOG!!!!!!! And, Josh said he is taking the neighbors complaint seriously! I have been complaining for months. i understand they have a kid but, so do I and she gets woken up and is scared of the banging! I would be happy if they transfered us... But, they want to charge us a 250.00 transfer fee and RAISE OUR RENT ALMOST 200.00 FOR THE SAME FLOOR PLAN!!!! If we went to a one bedroom it'd be 78.00$ more...  HOW unfair is that?! I understand apartment living I really do! But, midnight till six am is just tottaly un fair for us. I understand they have a kid but, so do we and we get up early. I cant hear my neighbor next door with three kids! They say were noisey? Every neighbor we have says they dont hear us and they always ask if weve been gone awhile! JOSH ALSO ASKED ME TO HAVE MY NEIGHBORS COME TO THE OFFICE TO VOUCH FOR ME. I find that so unprofessional!!!! Why bring them into this? Why even go that far? Why not transfer us and do the right thing and make us happy. I hope they let us out of our lease... I pay way to much here to be treated like this and go through this stuff. I am RESPECTFUL and if i am home... I am quiet and mostly sleep. How is it I can complain for months and the neighbor says one thing back about me and its taken seriously? Also, I dont want problems its frustrating when my baby screams and can't sleep at night... But Josh keeps telling the neighbor what I say and tells me what he says and that DOES not help at all.... I am sick of this!!!"
1,If you're a deep fried lover and love Japanese cuisine then go here!!! Staff is nice and the place is very cute!
1,"Food Is good. Service is slow. Large salads and sandwiches  with plentiful sides. Burger was cook ed as ordered. Their special sauce is killer good. Peppery spicy alone but on the burger is fantastic.  Cuban sandwich is large and filling and delicious. Brownie Ala mode is enough for two, maybe three. Order dessert only if you are not pressed for time. Took over 30 min to get dessert menu, order and stated eating.  It will take 1 hour for entree and another for dessert. Hard to get into a lunch hour."
0,"Zero stars if I could. Been going to this location since it opened and the quality and service has done nothing but go down hill. Bought the groupon last month. The wash was not even busy and it took them 48 minutes to wash my truck. My truck sat in the sun and dried while other vehicles moved through the line. When my truck came out of the wash tunnel it happened to get out in the line that was held up because another truck was getting extra detail work because it was going into the garage for a wax. So my truck and another car sat in the sun and dried! Managers excuse \""we are training new people\"". Won't be back even"
1,Seabass and pad thai with grass noodle are the best\nThis is my second visit. I will definitely visit again if i go to vegas.\nI got good deal on yelp which was $20 for $10\nServer was friendly
0,"I guess it's good for Vegas!  Thank goodness we didn't have to wait too long for ramen that is just ok!  My husband got the tonkatsu ramen, had no idea it didn't come with an egg (everywhere we eat at they give you an egg) so that's odd.  Then we tried the soup, wayy too salty.  My husband added water, about half a cup to dilute it, tasted so much better.  There really is no service.  We sat down, ordered and paid and that's pretty much it.  Don't expect to much.  We came in with high expectations because of the reviews, but left disappointed and hungry!"
0,"I had dinner here last week.  We went on Thursday night and there was a 45 min wait.  Good sign I thought!  I have no problem waiting for great food.  We took a seat on their patio and ordered a drink.  I ordered one of their signature cocktails with strawberry's and basil.  The waiter warned me that the drink was very strong and sweet,  since I like strong drinks I went for it.  This drink was terrible. TERRIBLE!!!! Not to mention I had to shell out about 12 buck with tax and tip for this undrinkable concoction.  Let me just say I am not dissatisfied because it was overly strong or sweet.   But rather because it was disgusting.  This is where St Fancis loses one full star from me.  \n\nOnce we were seated our server was very attentive and nice.  We were seated at a table right inside the door next to a lager table set into this glass alcove.  It looked very cool but once the birthday party with eight ladies took their seats this alcove turned into a megaphone projecting everything this group of ladies said right into our faces.  It was so uncomfortably loud that it was actually painful to my ears.  I found myself holding a hand over the ear closest to them.   We could hardly hold  a conversation.  I ordered a salad to start and requested it without the bacon, the kitchen either did not get this request or overlooked it, because my salad arrived covered in pig.  The goat cheese appetizer was pretty good. The forbidden rice and the pork chop were excellent.  If I were only reviewing our entr\u00e9es then this place would have gotten five stars.   \n\nAll in all we dropped around $100 for two people.  I am in no hurry to eat here again.  Although the entr\u00e9es were so tasty that I may be inclined to order just those again to go!"
1,"I love their sandwiches.. And of course the pastries, although they have a small selection of pastries.very friendly service."
0,"Overrated place with subpar service and an inordinate long wait for your food once ordered.  We visited on a busy Sunday at 1:00pm and waited 15 minutes (not bad) for an inside table. However, our waitress was awful and inattentive. Once our salads and burgers were ordered it took over 45 minutes before we received our food.  Food was tasty but a bit pricey.  Further, we twice asked our server for the salt & pepper shakers and finally got her attention after a third time. Wow! At these prices management should retrain the staff, cooks, and the host on better service with speed and proper follow up to make customers feel more important."
1,"ALW is amazing!!! Audrey truly is a great massage therapist! They are true to therr word when it comes to time too. 30 minutes means, 30 minutes! 60 minutes, means 60 minutes. This is an awesome place! :)"
1,Love the atmosphere and the 'grilled' wings (I don't believe they don't throw them in the fryer before grilling but I don't care; they taste great).  Had a brunch dish once and it was good if not memorable (I think it was some hash).  Wife liked the french toast last time.
1,"night.  The hotel is an average hotel of this caliber but the beds are really nice.  There is a microwave and refrigerator, good closet space, a nightstand, desk and a small table and chair.   Most rooms are on the ground floor and ours had French doors leading out to a grassy area.  Very nice if weather permitting.  It was full that night but it was very quiet.  Conveniently located you can walk to several restaurants.   Breakfast was the usual fare.  My one complaint was they ran out of decaf coffee and none ever appeared.  The check in staff was very helpful telling us about restaurant and the Bluegrass Festival which was in town that weekend.  They have menus in the lobby to peruse."
1,"Very cool restaurant concept.  Service was great and the decor was awesome!  The only reason I gave it four stars instead of five was the fact that the noodles had way too much sauce.  The Mexican chiliquilas we had were FANTASTIC!  I would for sure go back for the Mexican food again, but not sure I would it the Chinese."
1,I'd recommend this fish store if you are buying a whole salmon to poach:\nhttp://jitterycook.com/2011/11/29/poached-salmon-salad-sandwich-with-sauce-verte/\n\nor for their amazing smoked salmon that I've featured many times at www.jitterycook.com\n\nThey do have the best smoked salmon imaginable. Silky smooth. And you are offered a sample as you wait your turn in line.
1,"I had just recently moved out here and was looking for a new nail tech/salon. I am so glad I found this place! The place is very nice, the staff is beyond friendly, and the service I got was amazing. Casandra is amazing at what she does, absolutely amazing! I am beyond picky about my nails, I like them VERY short and squared without the edges rounded & she did that without ANY complaints and I also showed her a picture of what I wanted and she NAILED the picture to a T. I will be coming back without a doubt, best service I've got since I've been down here!"
1,"Sooo glad we finally decided to try Kelly's food! After studying the menu for quite some time, I finally decided upon the tofu tacos and JB got the shrimp po' boy sandwich In addition to our entrees, we wanted to sample some small bites as well. We ordered the famous mac 'n cheese and hot Pittsburgh tofu bites. \n\nTofu Tacos were delightful little cubes of tofu tossed in taco sauce and served on a hard shell with a bed of lettuce and salsa, sour cream and guac on the side. Good stuff, though not the highlight. \n\nShrimp Po' Boy was \""Okay\"" according to JB. The bun was superfluous as he took the top part off and ate it open-face, there was no sauce at all on the sammie, so JB had to douse on the Frank's Red Hot. To put it in his words, \""the sandwich was good, but I wouldn't order it again\"" \n\nThe sides and appetizers are what really shine at Kelly's. The french fries that accompanied the Po Boy were amongst the best I'd ever eaten - deep fried to golden delicious crispy perfection. The Hot Tofu Bites were sooooo good! Maybe a little too spicy (my nose was running) but the tofu's consistency was spot on, we both enjoyed immensely! Last but certainly not least, we had the Mac 'n Cheese which definitely lives up to the hype. The crispy charred cheese on top and the smooth, gooey, creamy cheese in the center compliment each other incredibly.. \n\nService was great, nice beer selection (I got the Breakfast Stout - and it was amazingly smooth and clean), even the music was stellar. Can't wait to go back!"
0,"I went here for the first time with my friend. She said she's been here more than a couple of times and she said it's good. So I said why not, lets try it. We came in, it was very very slow. We were the only customers. And this is during lunch time which is normally noon. Right as we walk in we were greeted by a lady that could barely speak english let along understand english. \n\nWe got to choose our seat, the booth. We were given menus and 3 minutes later the same lady came back and took our orders. I wanted a small at first but when she came back with our waters that definitely tasted like tap water....I changed my mind to get a large because I wanted to take some home for my boyfriend. She couldnt understand me at all, I said it at least five times that I wanted a large and then she just walked away and got another lady that could unserstand...so I told her what I wanted. So probably five minutes later we got our sprites which is pretty much filled with ice to the top..and we got our orders as well my friend (shrimp pho) mine (vegetable pho). \n\nOur food got to our table pretty quick. Like it wasnt even ten minutes. As I was taking a sip of my soup and eating my vegetables I noticed at least 10 of my vegetables had dirt on them, they were literally turning black already like they were rotting in the fridge and the kitchen still wanted to serve these vegetables. I picked them out and put them on another plate. I could say out of all my vegetables I didnt eat one cabbage at all because there was black stuff on them....like how unappealing! No one wants to eat food with black stuff on them. The broth was good but what really grossed me out was the vegetables that were already turning black!!! \n\nI don't think I'll come back here again. It's way overpriced for bad pho, with vegetables literally rotting in my pho. I don't want that and I dont think people should even be eating that!! that's not healthy at all. Yes they do have an A rating, but that's useless and basically fake if your vegetables and food in the kitchen are rotting and you still serve it to customers! That's just a health hazard! Who knows what else they serve that is rotting. This place needs to live up to better standards. Maybe THEN I will come back and try their pho again.....but not for awhile. I can't stand looking at my vegetables all dirty and rotting in my soup."
0,"Bad food, buffet is for $14 and my statement had a charge of $20, my friend had the same charge. \nFood was cold and not indian"
0,"My second time seeing KA was nothing like my first!\n\nI first saw this show with my girlfriends back in 2010 and fell in love with it. So much so that I decided to go again with my boyfriend this year. \n\nWell, while KA still has the same plot and theater, the show has changed for the worse. \n\nBoth my partner and I agreed that the show felt overproduced.  Lots of fillers and not enough acrobatics. I was very disappointed by the lack of tricks. How many friggin' times do we have to watch the tumble?! I seriously caught myself dozing off out of boredom on multiple occasions and THAT SHOULD NOT happen when you are watching a world renowned cirque!\n\n220$ later, we wished we had watched the \""O\"" instead."
1,yjeir desserts are great!\n\nget the meatloaf when it is on special!
1,"So, this was my first time trying Jimmy John's. I have been meaning to, but I haven't had a chance until now. I ordered the Vito and got my fella the Porker. I really enjoyed the french bread and look forward to trying the Beach Club with the 7 grain bread. I have a good feeling about that. \n\nThe toppings are very simple and fresh. There is a good variety of sandwiches to choose form and two types of bread. They also have delivery which I look forward trying out soon."
0,Not a very good selection. Had to wait for food to come out. Lots of fried options. Wanted to like it. Just didn't sit well. Sounds like timing at this place is crucial.
1,"Currently operating as a \""pop-up\"" sushi bar, but soon to open permanently in this location. They also have a mobile unit for street fare. Fun!  Running a small fresh sushi menu for now (with PBR for your drinking pleasure), however they intend to expand the menu to include hot Japanese specialties. Exciting! Super cool guys adding to the awesome of PGH. \n\nFor now, it looks like you can catch them at this listed location on Tues. and Wed. from 1-7pm and on Fri. and Sat. from 5-11pm. Then also at Bar Marco on Fridays from 11-3pm and Sunday nights at Shadow Lounge."
0,"sandwiches are OK,  just OK. mass delusional hype is the only explanation. sides were not worth it at all. skip waiting in line like a tool and just order the sandwich to go if you want the \""experience\"", what experience that is I have yet to figure out"
1,"Mix is my favorite spot in Vegas. Mix restaurant has a great atmosphere but the food is just ok for the price. (Crab salad excellent; fliet decent). Mix lounge is a great place to hangout. The view (top of the south end of the Strip looking north) is the best on or off the strip. I had assumed that the Luxor would block its view but that's totally not the case. There's an outdoor section divided up between general balcony and bottle service. I recommend the bottle service, not as pricey as a real club and more breathing room. And the waitresses are more attentive than other places. Not that the rest of the lounge is super crowded."
0,"Bought 3 cars here, went to buy a fourth when I found out the 2011 Acura MDX they sold me last year was in not 1,but TWO accidents prior to my ownership. The manager stated it was a clean no accident car with a clean carfax at purchase\n\nI guess I should have checked with my own eyes and not believed him, lost $4,000 on the trade in value because I can't trust this dealer.\n\nTo add insult to injury, the car I tried to buy was a WHOPPING $4,300 cheaper at another dealer and I did not even have to haggle...So I went elsewhere.\n\nThey are really nice to your face, but rip you off here...go elsewhere."
1,"The last time I was in Pittsburgh for baseball was the late 90s at Three Rivers when I was a teenager. When I saw my Braves were going to be here in August, my brother and I planned a day trip down from Western NY. We were both very impressed with PNC Park and the surrounding area. \n\nWe waited next to the right field gate before we could get in. There was a little fence with a concrete bench attachment across the access road we could sit in and enjoy the shade. Only waited about 3-4 minutes in line once the gates opened. They check bags, but you can bring one that is 16x16x8 in and you can bring up to a 24 oz disposable water bottle in for each person. Could get in 1.5 hours before and the Braves were about halfway through batting practice when we got there so we went to our seats to watch. \n\nI picked up tickets (dugout box) at box office price on StubHub in March, but people around us said they got tickets right from the Pirates website this week there too. The seats were very nice. Patted bottoms, wide enough that you weren't totally squished. I was lucky and no one sat the in the two seats next to me even. There was a nice attendant for the section that cleaned off the seats and welcomed us in. He did a good job making sure kids got foul/extra balls and getting autograph hawks out of the way before the game. Though I would have liked to see the whole park enforce not having people go to their seats during game play. \n\nI walked around some and they had many different choices for food but the lines were pretty long about 30-45 minutes before the game. Prices were typical for a ball park, though I think $4 for a bottle of water and $5 for a 20oz bottle of pop are excessive. $9 for a higher end milkshake, $5-9 for Dippin Dots, etc.  I was full from the early dinner we ate so I had a Lemon Chill cup. It was like 16oz and only $5.50, so I enjoyed it for like half of the game and it hit the spot. My brother got Nachos later with two cups of the cheese, jalapenos, and onions on it and an Iron City Beer. \n\nWe parked at the W. General Robinson garage across the street and it was an easy in and out to get back on 279-N HOV lane and get out of downtown. \n\nI'd definitely look to come back to Pittsburgh and catch more games in the future."
0,I generally love Lucky Lous but they have been really hit or miss lately. Just got 3 chicken tenders the size of my thumb and they dont appear to be hand battered like normal... whats going on? Used to be amazed by how good these tenders were but this is pretty disappointing.
1,"when you're in vegas, you think of two things for the hotel you stay in, does it have a moderately tolerable bath facility and bed to snooze in and where it's located in the strip\n\nballys meets above criterias with a cheap affordable price, done deal, see you in vegas"
0,"The good: It's cheap and centrally located.  I mean honestly I paid $32 after the resort fee and it is right in the heart of the strip.  That really makes it a compelling stay.\n\nThe bad:  It was comically hard to navigate and really beat up.\n\nNow the full story:\nWhen you first get to the Quad you have to find the entrance.  There are two and neither are marked very well due to construction.  The one in the front off Las Vegas blvd is a bat cave style entrance that pops up out of nowhere.  Go too fast and you'll zoom right past.  The other is off Koval Lane.  It is labeled \""Employee's Only\"" but nobody ever said anything to me and it was about 100 times easier to get in and out of.\n\nNow speaking of getting in and out, after you park you are going to want to grab a granola bar, a bottle of water, a holy bible, and an expert guide to get to the front desk.  And I'm not kidding.  There are no signs anywhere in the garage that tell you where you need to go.  And if you park in the right side of the garage that is only 3 stories, it is completely disconnected from the hotel and you either have to walk all the way around or go down an elevator, around a wall, down a flight of stairs, up two escalators, down an escalator, and through a long hall before you finally can check in.  By the time you get to the front desk you will be in perfect shape for the Vegas summer pool parties.\n\nNow comes the front desk. Hopefully one time when you were in Vegas you signed up for Total Rewards Gold.  It's a player's club card.  It's free.  It works in all the Harrah's owned property (a lot of properties).  And it will save you a lot of time.  With the Total Rewards Gold card you get to go in the side line that had one person in line and two people behind the desk.  Took all of 2 minutes to check in.  If you don't have the card, you will wait in the general population line.  Might want to get a drink first.  About 100 people long and only 4 people working the desk.  I saw people waiting for nearly an hour.\n\nWhile checking in they offered me a strip view.  \""Hell yeah\"" you might think.  No.  Just No. Read the other reviews.  The strip is loud loud.  Until 4 am.  I asked the front desk guy if it would be loud and he said \""Oh yeah\"".  I then asked for an interior room and they had some so we were all set.  Room faced the interior pool and was nice and quiet.  \n\nNow onto the journey to the rooms.  The elevators here are slow.  Like 1920's I could take the stairs 23 floors faster than this elevator slow.  Like press the button and go eat a meal and come back slow. But they arrived and we went up.  We walked out of the elevator and as we were walking to our room I said something about the strip and a woman who looked like she had been up for days partying and was wearing only a leopard thong and bathing suit top popped up and said \""Oh are you the room looking for the stripper?\"" We were not.  Although had we been, this would have been remarkably convenient.\n\nCarpet in the hallways is really beat up.  The rooms look old.  There was a homemade ash tray on our balcony and our non-smoking room smelled of cigarettes.  The toilet was either borrowed from a midget circus or an elementary school.  We couldn't decide on which we thought was more plausible.  The beds were clean and comfortable though.  And we were only staying for one night.  When we got tired of roaming the strip it was easy and fast to get back to our hotel\n\nIn summary: It's cheap and centrally located, but you may be better staying at the Strat and cabbing it. Our friends paid about the same as us and their room made ours look like a discount Alabama motel.  And the cab ride was like $8.  We lived and it became the running joke of the weekend, so no harm no foul.  Don't think I'll be staying here again, at least not until construction is complete."

0,Oh my ...dont like the food here. Tried the Pad thai and the chicken fried rice ...the pad thai was disgusting and the fried rice was not enticing either ...wont be going back ...ugh
0,"For buying used clothes, this is an ok place with decent prices. I actually think it's a little overpriced for used stuff, but I've never purchased anything from here.\n\nHowever, I have sold clothes here over the years, and it seems like they are getting super picky and stingy about what they are choosing to buy now. Plus, the percentage you get back is very little ( I believe it's 35% of what they'll sell it for). I've brought in some really cute, unworn clothes to this store on my last two or three visits, but they denied everything. Sometimes I don't understand why because I've seen some hideous stuff here before. I guess it just depends on the buyer you get. \n\nThey do tend to take more designer labels, but you'll never get your money's worth by selling them here. I tried to sell my Guess pumps here, and they were in perfect condition and only worn once. Guess how much they offered me for them? $5.80 -_-.\n\nI don't think I'll be coming back here anymore, but I will recommend this place to anyone who wants clean out their closets or to anyone who likes to go thrift shopping. I'd only go with selling cheaper, trendy stuff like Forever 21 and Urban Outfitter brands. I wouldn't recommend anyone to sell their designer items here because you'll just get ripped off."

0,"Out of business. For some reason, I have to write a whole paragraph about this. So, I will say that they are really, really, really, really, really out of business. Doors locked. Signs gone. Paint peeling off."
0,"I was calling around to find a place that could get my wife right in.\n\nI called this place and was told they could get us right in. I said we would be there in 10 minutes ... no problem.\n\nWe got there and waited a little while. Was told she would be seeing one of the best. The nail dude asked my wife some very personal and strange questions while working on her.\n\nWhen done, we got to the car and realized the nails were of varying length - also the sides of the nails were not properly filed. Went back in and one of the owners said she would fix them. Turns out she was so distracted, she made my wife's finger start bleeding and still did a poor job. The owners daughter was running around the business. Cute little girl, but very unprofessional. Her other daughter was arguing that she did not want to bring the little girl to get food, as it was too hot outside - unless the dad gave her his car.\n\nWould not go back ... Yelp reviews failed on this one."
1,"All they need to do is add a Forever 21, and then I will never have to go to ghetto Fiesta Mall or drive through god-awful traffic to the Chandler Mall!"
1,"Just got back from the comedy show at Standup Scottsdale. We saw Vince Morris! What a great show! Hubby and I laughed until we cried and my stomach muscles were hurting. We ended up being part of the show and the crowd was chanting my name. Too funny! If you ever get a chance to see him, you should! And we got to see the show for free!"
0,"I have been a long time weekly customer of this car wash. There have been a few instances where the wait was a little long.  However, today they lost a customer, \""Me\"". I took my car for an oil change and wash to discover my IPOD was stolen from my center console. The first indication was when I turned my tuner back on and it stated, \""No connection\"".  I quickly looked in the center console to discover it had been gone through and was a mess. There was a disconnected charger and no IPOD. I should have removed it from the car but on the other hand, I should not have to. I reported it to the manager and he could care less. He gave me a 10% discount card. How nice of him..."
0,"Service was slow, food was gross. After all the high reviews I don't know if we just had bad luck or what, but nothing was good about this place. \n\nWent for an early dinner on a Thursday. Around 5. There were only 2-3 couples in the place eating. We ordered drinks and calamari. The calamari should have a disclaimer that it isn't like what you expect. They were giant fish stick like pieces of what I would guess was squid but it tasted and chewed like rubber. It was barely edible. We order the king pot and gumbo. gumbo tasted like canned tomato soup with a few tiny shrimp and some sausage in it. It was the worst I've had. Wife's crab was good, but the rest of her dish had a funky taste. Took it home to try not to be rude since she barely touched it and dumped it in the trash. We both barely touched our food and were ready to go. Waiting brought out check and we still didn't have the drinks we ordered. We pointed this out since they were on the bill and we never got them. Instead of offering to take them off she just walks off and 10 minutes later brings us our drinks when our food is already boxed up to go. We each took a sip and then left. \n\nWould not return and of all the places in Arizona we have ate since moving here, this has been the worst experience."
0,"Worst Pizza Ever! They just lost a customer and with service like that Vincent's is on its way to being just another one of those short-lived restaurants near the I-10 and Ray.  I called in for the $19.99 one-topping  pizza and wings special and decided to upgrade to the bbq chicken pizza for $7.  Terrible decision because their bbq sauce and chicken are awful, but the crust is so terrible it wouldn't really matter what was on top of it.  \n\nSo I called in to possibly get a different pizza sent out and I got to talk to Jack.  Maybe he is a cook trying to act like a manager but he certainly lacks any sort of customer service skills.  His offer to me was half off a new pizza.  Half off a pizza that I paid extra for, which I was ok with only to find out the bbq chicken pizza is only sauce, chicken and cheese.  That sounds like the one-topping pizza special that i ordered."
0,"We were eager to try So-Cal, so last night was the night. Maybe we expected to much from a restaurant that says they \"" want to give you food that you can get stoked about\"". \n\nOk, it started out good. We got the Oysters on the half shell and some of the Mission Brewery Hefeweizen. The Oysters were fresh and very tasty. The beer, cold and refreshing.\n\nI ordered the mahi tacos, and my husband ordered the shrimp tacos. With each bite we kept saying to each other, is this it? We came here for this? We waited 30 minutes for this?  The tacos did not have much flavor. Tacos from Rubio's taste much better. The beans tasted as if they were out of a can, and whats with white rice with tacos? Is that what they do in So-Cal ?\n\nMaybe the cooks were a little to much in a \""California State Of Mind\"" last night, and forgot the seasonings on the fish."
0,"I have given this Michaels a 1 star and I wish I could give no stars to show how unprofessional and non-polite the employees are.\n\nMy friend and I went to Michael's to get ideas for our holiday dinner, where we were looking for orchards and center pieces to put on our table. \n\nFirst thing it was hard to find someone to assist us and once we found a woman to help us, she was very unpleasant and didn't want to help. She really didn't know where any of the center pieces were and just passed us on to another store employee.\n\nSecondly once we walked to the counter where the other employee was arranging flower arrangements, We both stood there for at least 2 minutes until he decided to acknowledge that we were standing there! Once he finally acknowledged that we were standing there he neither help us like the other employee did! All he said was \""whatever we have would be over in that section\"" and all he did was point his finger in the direction in which he was talking about, never lifting up his head from his project that he was completing on his desk. \n\nIn all I never found what I was looking for and wasted nothing but time.\n\nI will definitely never be returning to this Michaels and encourage you all to do the same!!"
0,"Omg this place has gone downhill!!!! \n\nThis WAS one of my favorite happy hour spots in town. Not so much anymore. \n\nMy friend and I were in the area and decided on this spot to meet up for drinks. We walked in, waited about 5 mins for a table and sat down. TWENTY minutes pass and still no service. My friend finally got up to the hostess to ask where out server was. The only saving grace of this place was our server. I completely forgot her name but she was so bubbly and nice. Not the fake nice, but the genuine nice. \n\nAnyway, prices for HH went up about 75 cents. Food quality went downhill with smaller portions. I ordered this one frozen lemonade Bellini concoction and it was awful. Only reason I drank it was because I didn't want to waste alcohol. \n\nAnyway, I had a good time with my friend but I don't think I'll be returning here nor would I recommend anyone to this place ever!!"
1,I love chipotle. \nTheir food is so fresh and tasty. \n\nThe only thing I dislike are the peppers ... They're always dry and taste metallic.  I just avoid them but the rest if their food is epic.
1,"The Zulu Caffe is a fairly new and the only restaurant gracing the empty spot in the Scottsdale Airport terminal. The three lovely lady owners and their team and service are spectacular. Their food is moderately priced and always presented in a passionate fashion. Kudos to the chef. I'm sure we'll see discounts for regulars soon. I hear they are planning to use the flashy SquareUp App for this and other promotions. Stop by for breakfast or lunch and watch the planes and jets arrive and depart.\n\nDid I mention FREE WiFi ?!? A HUGE plus these days in order to hang and do some mobile biz over a cappuccino or lemonade.\n\nRemember to 'Like' Zulu Caffe on Facebook and drop them a line. Ideas are always welcome. Support your immediate community and small businesses wherever you can. The Scottsdale airport is a real alternative to most other places. Who knows, you might get inspired to do your pilot's license like we did.\n\nAnd if I get surprised some day by longer hours and getting served by a PanAm - style steward or stewardess staff, I'd give them a five star rating ;-)"
0,"Never again! My promoter assured me and my friend, another female that we would be able to get into the club with no problems if we arrived around ten. We did and the guest list bitches gave us general admission passes instead of the slip of paper needed to gain access to this club for free. The line did not seem long so we decided to wait, no one was moving from our line for an hour and the host walking the line assured us he was going to get us in. Scores of girls in their \""Vegas Whore\""  dresses walked by us with slips of paper. We were wearing said dresses as well,but obviously we were in the wrong line. 12:00 a.m. came and went so we decided to just jump the line while the bouncers were not looking and went up to the cashier, they wanted money even though we had passes, conveniently they expire at midnight.. We went back up to the guest list bitches and host asshole, who promptly told us it was too late to get that little white slip of paper so we could get in free, to which I promptly screamed at the top of my lungs that this club sucked anyway and I would never come back and spend my money here. The music I heard while waiting sucked and the crowd was full of Jersey Whoreish douchbags both male and female. The bouncers had tremendous attitude for being short and ugly and probably have small pee pee's too. Fuck this place, I would never spend a dime here or recommend that anyone go here ever..."
1,"I got a salad,  it was good but it wasn't anything to write home about. My friend and my husband got the same sandwich I believe it was the avocado bacon sandwich and they both said it was good but wish that I had more fillings in it. They said that the bread was very thick and the insides weren't present enough. For the price now I guess you can't really complain. Seven dollars for a sandwich or for a salad right on the strip in Las Vegas really is unheard of."
1,"AMAZE BALLS! This place is awesome! We ate twice in one weekend. If you have to wait, no worries, its WORTH IT! The food and service was awesome! We had a realy cool guy serving us and giving us a hard time but in a super funny way! The food was all HUGE so be prepared! \nI are the Best BLT ever in my life. It was the lunch special. Jalepenos and Spicy Bacon. YUM!!\nWill go back again next time!"
0,"We were looking for good ole pub food and excited when we saw Todd English P.U.B.  This place is great for beers but food - the quality does not justify the price.\n\nDirty Chicken : way too salty\nLobster Roll: you would imagine that it would be a freshly baked roll.\n\nThe only good dish was the Shepherd's Pie.\n\nHowever, not enough for me to want to go back.  In fact, we didn't finish most of the dishes."
1,"I've followed Keli from her previous wax studio to her new location. She opened her own mini spa in Salon 3121. \n\nI live between Phoenix, San Francisco and  Los Angeles. It's always difficult to find a good service professional. I have found the previous professionals didn't match up to my LA and SF girls. I went through four different estheticians before luckily landing Keli. She's detailed, fast, clean and a total professional. She also uses hard wax is easier on the skin. Almost pain free. I wish I could move her to LA! \n\nSince she's her own boss, her prices are great too. I have finally found someone in Phoenix that I trust for my skin care."
0,"Star of India is only good if you go to CMU and if you don't feel like going to India Garden or a better Indian restaurant further away from campus. They do have some good naan but the service is slow and not very good. The food is also not very good. The lamb vindaloo is the only thing that I'll eat there. The chicken tikka masaala has way too much butter and cream in it. \n\nWhen it comes to the spiciness of food, a 6 is extremely spicy. And I do like my curry spicy. Overall, don't go here unless you can't go to India Garden."
1,"We had an amazing experience here. There were only a few other guests here while we were dinning so things were very intimate. The food and service was beyond 5 stars. \n\nThe ambiance is amazing. Dark, intimate, and classically modern. Being here just felt right. \n\nThey have a million people on staff. One person brings you to your seat, another person pulls the chair back for you, another bring silverware, another does drinks, etc. you get the point. Their fresh baked breads were amazing and constant! They had bacon bread rolls made every 20 minutes, they were amazing. \n\nThe Amuse-bouche was a tuna tartar that really set the tone for the evening. We ordered the Wagyu tartar and sweetbreads for the appetizer, they were insanely good and fairly priced. \n\nThe Wagyu was served with a chocolate crisp and mixed with the most delicate of ingredients topped with an egg yolk. The sweetbreads were lightly battered and confit in bacon lardo, the sweetbreads go down as one of the best dishes I have had. \n\nI had the veal cheeks, I have had veal cheeks before and this is by far the best that I had. They were cooked to perfection, I cannot say anything bad about my dish. \n\nThis place truly deserves its Michelin stars! The prices are so good considering what you get. There were 4 of us, we had 2 apps, 4 meals, 2 bottles of wine and dessert all under $400?! This is insane for 4 people at a Michelin rated restaurant."
0,"This review is for the Mekong palace restaurant. Was not warmly welcomed the whole visit.  when I placed my order the waiter didn't know what I was talking about when I read exactly off the menu. The whole staff set up for lunch for themselves and ate at the next table over and forgot we were there making every request we had seem like a bother. Food is not fresh all from cans, saw it delivered."
0,Oak room will never waste my time again smh. If you don't buy a table you will not be admitted entrance to this so called exclusive club. Seems like you need to be of the Caucasian decent to even be in there. Hate to pull the race card but it is what is.
1,"I have been taking our cat Boris to Hillside since we moved here from Michigan in 2007.  Boris has had excellent care from both Dr. Rosonke and Dr. Council, as well as the veterinary technicians Gayle, Heidi, and Matthew.  The front desk staff have also been incredibly helpful in getting Boris in quickly for a recent health problem, they are wonderful.  Thank you Andria, Audrey, Amanda and Kelly.  Everyone here really understands that having a sick pet is a very difficult time both physically for the pet and emotionally for the owners.  Everyone here is so supportive and they truly care about the care your pet receives.   You cannot go wrong with bringing your pet here for both wellness care and illness issues.  I highly recommend Hillside Animal Hospital."
1,I bought a bike on Craigslist (Trek Madone 5.2) a few days earlier in Los Angeles. When I rode the bike for the first time I was in serious pain. I thought I bought the wrong size. Jayme help with my fit and did a great job. We didn't do the Guru fit but I can't image it being any better. Thanks for the help and I will be back!
1,Excellent fish and chips. Yummy. You are not to have hard liquor at the bar due to a weird liquor license. The gaming machines are alright. It has an old feel to it because of all the wood. I like this place because of the fish and chips not much more. Other than that ...its just the same old pub.
0,So after rest frustration trying to GET here. This... Is not a DMV. It's a tag and title agency. Well at least it is now.
0,"I hate to give one star, but even that is generous. I went to see Ghost last night and it was a disaster. To start, they only accept cash at the bar and they don't have a working ATM. Unless you are close to the stage, you're pretty much screwed. There are 3 huge beams obstructing the view of the stage. If you are standing on the 21+ side, there are several obnoxious blinding lights shining down on you, making it even harder to see the stage, also killing any kid of enjoyable atmosphere.\nMeanwhile in the bathroom, there was one drunk girl passed out on a couch and another throwing up in the stall. Both paper towel machines were broken. The security guards were standing around the bathroom (it's one of those community washrooms), watching me touch up my make-up, giving me thumbs up. Awkward. \nThere was a drunk guy stumbling around bleeding from his face. He was kicked out, but then let back in 20 minutes later. Really? \n\nThis venue could be great but it is so poorly managed. Needs some work!"
1,"The people who are complaining about this place need to realize something...this is a fast food hot dog place....in the basement of a casino.  It is what it is.  If you are looking for a quick meal this works.  It's a hot dog people.  I'm from Chicago and I love my Chicago style hot dogs, but Nathan's does a decent job with their dog too.  Don't come here expecting 5 star food.  Come here when you want a delicious, greasy meal."
1,"As far as chain restaurants go, this one is top notch. It has everything you could want in a food venue. Great appetizers, huge portions, great drink selections, and more.\n\nI like the fact that they make \""strong\"" mixed drinks, and they usually have some great local and seasonal beers on tap. The Guac-a-Tony appetizer is by far my favorite. I even know a guy who, the first thing he does when he comes in from out of town is orders this. Just make sure you have more than two people in your group before trying this appetizer otherwise you won't be able to eat anything else.\n\nIndeed, they make great pizza, but there is so much more to this restaurant than their pizza. In fact, I don't remember the last time I actually got a pizza from them."
1,"I have never loved a haircut so much till I got here. I read reviews here on Yelp and they didn't disappoint at all. I called to schedule for Kim and she is the nicest hairdresser I've had in a while. It's so hard to find a good hair salon but thank goodness for Isis. Shampoo, haircut (layers & side bangs), blow dry, straightened and styled with my thick, frizzy, long, unhealthy hair for $30? I'll be coming here from now on. Thank you Kim!"
1,"Iron Chef America (Food Network) is one of my favorite shows... I've been lucky to see some of them do some demos live (Chef Morimoto, Chef Symon, Chef Garces). I've also been lucky to have my first and second Iron Chef restaurant experience at Chef Garce's Mercat a la Planxa ( http://www.yelp.com/user_details_review_search?userid=mjOKUSdIqxFPSYMB-MmS9g&q=mercat ). Amazing! \n\nLast day in Vegas, almost ready to head to the airport, my friends and I decided to have one last nice lunch. My friend was craving Italian so we went to the Venetian... after looking at several restaurant menus, she picked ENOTECA San Marco \nI immediately smiled, this is Iron Chef Batali's restaurant - another for my \""collection\"" :p \n\nWe were seated almost immediately, love that it gives the illusion of outside seating, and you get to enjoy the hotel performances while there. \nYou also have the option of seating at the \""bar\"", which also gives you view to the performances. \nThey start by bringing you some cracker/bread sticks & water. Then comes your server to get your drink order and let you know about the day's specials. Wine list is extensive and some are even serve starting at 2oz in case you want to do a sampling... \nThen a bread basket is brought to the table, and let me tell you, you will have to apply a lot of self control to only have one. It's warm, fool of flavor and it complements anything you order perfectly. \n\nWe all ordered something different so we could try more things. I had the Gemelli and it was good, LOVED that it had spinach and broccoli mixed in with the pasta. But the best one I would have to say was the Penne alla Norma, if I'm ever back (and I wish I am) I'll order this. \n\nStaff was very friendly, and very good at making suggestions. They made sure we had everything we needed and that we enjoyed our meal and time there. It's a beautiful place to go have a nice, relaxing meal. Another great Iron Chef experience."
1,"This is the location I frequent the most often. It is conveniently located on the way to the 24 hour fitness and also on my way back home too! The staff there is very friendly and they have had some great sales recently. \n\nThe store is always clean and there is no intimidation factor that of other health supplement stores that try to pressure you into buying stuff you don't need so they can get their commission. \n\nTheir store brand products come in a wide variety of items and I always like to save on that! Great customer service here all the time. The parking gets tricky when you try to get in there around lunch time since there are some restaurants that get heavy traffic but there is 15 min. parking right up front of the store, good thinking!"
0,"Buffet? Well just because I live in Las Vegas doesn't mean I like to gamble with my food! We went to the Rampart Buffet around 11AM. It was about $16 each to enter and I was wildly disappointed with the food. The shrimp laid out next to the sandwich  mayonnaise totally grossed me out, the ham at the breakfast bar was brown, english muffin ...well I don't know how old it was but my fiance's butter knife wouldn't cut thru it. \n\nI played it safe and had a salad ( tasty! ) and some strawberries. \n\nI wish I could have done a walk thru before I paid to eat there. Barf."
0,"I'm really surpised by the reviews for Ka. After having seen La Reve and a traveling Cirque du Soleil production (Corteo), I was very excited to see Ka. We had good seats, about half way up (which is where you want to sit). The production value was good -- the stage itself was very neat. However, the music wasn't great, the acrobatics were OK, and it was just a little boring.\n\nI don't need a plot -- Corteo is a dream sequence -- La Reve doesn't have a clearly articulated plot. But this just didn't do enough to amaze me, excite me, entertain me, etc. Both my wife and I couldn't wait to get out!"
0,The quality of their work is mediocre. But the lady at the front desk is so incredibly rude and can't even communicate well enough to understand specifics about what you'd like to have done.
0,"Ok, so I went here on Valentines Day with my other half. The food was alright, but I have had better, especially in my trips in Vegas. I was trying to find a place since my other half and I were seeing two shows to eat in between. It looked really cute, and had \""outside seating\"" meaning an outer terrace but not outside but rather outside on the inside of the hotel. \n\nThe food was not as good as I had hoped. Although the Pizza my other half had was amazing so I would recommend that! However for as cute as it looks it was not romantic, was slow, the customer service was not great which is surprising for Vegas. It is certainly a place to go if you just want to eat something fast, but don't be expecting much. And do not go there for romance even if it looks charming you can go else where to \""whoo\"" your loved one. I would even try the place across the way it looked better, I checked it out when we were done eating."
1,"Wow.  I am SO glad i found this place.   I lived in Peru for 5 years when I was a kid and visited again when I was older,  so every once in a while I just get The Craving.  Imagine my surprise when I just googled to see if there happened to be a Peruvian restaurant near the Oracle route to PHX  (on the way to visit a friend in Gilbert) and I found Inka Empire there near her house.  \n\nEverything tasted SO Yummy.  Delicious.  Party in the mouth can't stop nibbling- as authentic Peruvian food is.  Each dish!  Over the years in different cities, we've been disappointed so we were happily in awe is each dish came out and it was like, munching and happy eating sounds \""Wow, so good, like I remember\""  I left the last bite of Lomo for my mom and her self sacrificing tendencies gave way and she ate it.  \n\n- Lomo Saltado had THE flavor both my mom and I have not been able to reproduce in our own kitchens.  I will have to tinker again.  \n\n-The Papas ala Huancaina (sp?)  were fabulous and tasted cheesier than cheese as they should.  Fresh and heat in the mouth at the same time if that makes sense.  \n\n-The Platanos (fried bananas) were like candy.   \n\n-The parched corn... I put on the aji and was in bliss.\n\n-The ajis/ sauces... I want some now to dip everything in.  I want to go back and try their anticuchos and ceviche... (ceviche was my sushi gateway back in the day.)\n\n\nI bought some Inca Colas and Dona Peppas for my mom to take home to my siblings for them and their families to enjoy and remember Peru with.  \n\nI live out East now, but I will be back when I am in town and I bet my parents will find a way to \""happen to drop by\"" on the way up to PHX.  \n\nWatch out.  It was easy to miss this restaurant hidden next to an empty storefront.  But if you find it...  It is So Good."
1,"I've wanted to check this place out for a long time and I was not disappointed. This is where I will bring my out of town friends to prove to them that Arizona is cool. Despite being relatively small the high ceiling and bay windows give the place an open airy feeling. The atmosphere is chill, cool and classy. They play good music and the drinks while not cheap are good and strong the way I like 'em. I had a good buzz going after two vodka sodas and a beer. I did of course have two cocktails and a beer BEFORE coming here so cumulative damage was already in effect.  The patio is AWESOME with cool leather chairs with reclining back rests My inner scenesta was a cool and sophisticated yet happy camper. \nThis is another place any Arizonan sick of the casual scene can dress up (the place is still casual so you don't have to get too dressed up) and have a nice, stylish night out. The agenda would be: have dinner at Distrito, then stroll across the way to AZ88 and savor some high end beverages-take your time, enjoy the vibe and savor your drink-like I said.....the drinks ain't cheap. Then when you're good and buzzed and feel like behaving in appropriately, that's when you head over to the Coach House to ride out the downward spiral. Not a bad way to do brunch either if you're ok with being passed out by 7:00pm.\nBottom line, this is a great place to come with friends for a classy night or at least a classy START to the night in Scottsdale."
0,"eh...not terrible, but not worth spending money on either. I tried 3 different snacks and a pistachio cake. The cake wasn't good at all.\n\nvery friendly service."
1,"Very inexpensive, clean room.  Small room, but all I did in there was sleep so that doesn't matter to me.  I paid $96 for three nights!  Having a Dunkin Donuts in there is a great idea!  Easy coffee in the morning and better than Starbucks (cheaper too!).   The buffet was awful, there are many better options for food around there."
0,"This location is actually closed now. \n\nWhen I went, I brought in 2 huge bags of clothes which included New French connection heels, some vintage Ben Sherman, etc. Everything I brought is was in good condition. After looking through everything for 15 minutes, they told me they had no use for any of these things. Really? Ben Sherman? Their loss, so I sold them on eBay and made some good money. No point of returning. Selection in this store looked like a goodwill on a bad day for triple their price."
0,"I refuse to go to LVAC, hahaha.  Why you ask, because they advertise that women join free, how lame.  It's just a gym, not a nightclub.  I'm there to workout, not pick up on women.  That's the only reason i would think why you'd \""encourage\"" women to join.\n\nBesides that, LVAC is only in Las Vegas.  If you travel a lot, or plan to, then what would be the point of spending all that money on a membership you can only use in Vegas.\n\nI did give it one star as I do like the fact there there is an indoor track at the 215 and Eastern one.  That's all you get though LVAC.  hahaha"
0,"Because of their restaurant policy, I give it two stars because of the bartender. \n\nI came here to do the bar menu and have a few drinks for my BIRTHDAY..I thought the bar menu was from 4:00-6:00pm but it was 3:00-5:00pm. We had arrived at 4:15pm and ALL seats at the bar were taken but there were small tables next to the bar that were EMPTY.  \n\nI asked the host if we could sit at one of the small tables and he informed us that ALL tables are for DINNER ONLY and it starts at 5:00 pm. ( he wasn't the most friendly) Well there goes that plan. No one would be leaving the BAR and then the menu would be over. I have never heard of a restaurant that ONLY provides seats at the \""literal\"" bar when they are serving their bar menu. Maybe they do things differently in CA.\n\nPlan B: Go to the Bellagio fountain show..which was wonderful as they had the show to the tune Lady Luck by Frank Sinatra..ahh...classic Vegas..on the way back, we walked past OLives and I thought well I have to at least get a birthday drink and they had 2 seats open. The bartender poured well ..got our money's worth, not watered down like most restaurants ( that is why I make my own most of the time). Didn't have dinner, too expensive and needed a reservation though the seating was practically empty for the tables..went to see the Monet exhibit and get dessert elsewhere.."
0,"If your going to RA, I would recommend choosing another location. I frequently visit the Awahtukee spot, which is really great, and this chain let me down. Not only did the restaurant seem pretty worn, the food was awful. The shrimp dynamite roll was a greasy, soggy mess of mostly heavy cream sauce with a few scallops over rice pieces - disgusting. When the waitress asked how the dish was and I expressed my disappointment, you would think you would get an offer to send it back or pick something else. Nope....just a blank look of confusion (but she was really nice). I had then ordered the Viva Las Vegas roll, which I have had many times at other locations, but something was not quite right at this place. The pieces were a lot smaller and not evenly tempura battered. I'm in no way a sushi snob, but I was pretty upset that I spent a good amount of dough for a crappy meal. On the plus side, the waitress treated my son with complimentary gelato. If I ever decide to visit RA again, it won't be here."
0,John sold me a transmission with a year warranty and it broke and he told me I broke it so it wasn't under warranty..... What the hell is a warranty for exactly?? If it breaks it's fixed by the shop.. I had to haggle for a day just to get him to cover half the cost.. Beware a warranty at the mustang shop is not a warranty. Oh yea and he sold me a 5.0 engine that had the lowest compression that I've ever seen and almost didn't take it back. 40psi was the highest measurement I got on cylinder 2.if you want good mustang parts go else ware!
1,"Best Thai in Charlotte... The Owner can be arrogant sometimes, but the food is great... Red and green curries are best...\nPad Thai is good too...\nDinner takeout portion is big, 2 people can easily share one entree!!"
1,Oh so good! We came in with high hopes and they were easily met! Great food and great service made for a great first experience here. We will definitely be back!
0,"Blah, worst coffee ever. Had this place 2 weeks ago and I will never come back. Their drip coffee tasted watered down, overpriced and it was by far the shittiest coffee I have ever had. I would much rather get my coffee from AM/PM then ever walk into this place again. Horrible."
1,Food was good. Had all you can eat sushi was worth the $24.99 prices of thing that we were disappointed with was the rice was soggy. Too much water when they cooked it's but everything else it was good . Ambience was awesome . Service was awesome. Would definitely go back again
1,"My partner and I have been coming here for years.  We also bring friends along who are either Thai food lovers or just adventurous.  The atmosphere is eclectic and the crowds are casual.  The staff is personable, cheerful and smiling.  They are willing to make suggestions as well as modify a dish to your liking.  The spice scale goes from non-existent at 0 to a scorching 10.\nThe food is fresh, individually made, service is quick and server attentiveness is just right.   Water is always filled, extra rice is not a problem and I have seen many of the same customers in there for years now.\n  The Todd munn is a favorite; crisp and hot patties of whitefish, chili and green bean fried to perfection. Fresh rolls are fresh egg roll wrappers filled with rice, basil, carrot, and your choice of shrimp or tofu...both worth trying with the wonderful dipping sauce. The array of curries is excellent, especially the Mussuman. The noodle dishes are great with your choice of meat or sea food.   If you can't find something to enjoy at Thai Gourmet, then you really do not like Thai food."
0,"My family and I have been dining at Sakana on Elliot for at least a decade and for the most part, have been very satisfied with our experiences. In fact, we would call it one of our \""go-to\"" places. Over the last 6 months or so however, that has changed and as of today, I will not go back. Craving fresh sashimi and being consistently disappointed has not been good for my loyalty nor my pocket book. Today, my son and I tried yet again, wanting to give Sakana another chance. Today the albacore was fishy and mushy, some of the other fish was \""borderline\"" and my cucumber roll lacked any substance or finesse.We were told nothing would be done in terms of compensation (i.e. taking something off the tab) because we did not inform them in enough time. Poor quality food, poor service...big bummer."
1,"The World Series of comedy is AWSOME ! Very funny , had me laughing all the way home. Drinks don't come to often due to all the people but it's very good."
1,We have been in a couple of times and everything we have tried we loved. I was especially pleased and surprised by their brownies. I got it for my hubby since that is what he likes most and I tried a little.. That lead to half of it. Luckily they are big. We have to get 2 every time now.  She said she imports the chocolate from France.. wee wee it is DELICIOUS!!   I highly recommend trying this place out and supporting our local small business!
0,"My friend and I were walking the Strip waiting for lunch spots to open... and the candy store caught our eye so we browsed a little. Then we realized it was time for a drink. Sugar Factory American Brasserie is located right next to the candy shop... well played... well played.\n\nDrink menu consists of candy-themed cocktails. I'm not really a fan of a sugar overload when it comes to intoxicating myself so I asked our waiter for the least sweetest thing on the menu and then asked him to make it even less sweet. \n\nIt was good, and the theme is cute........... but $18 for a cocktail. Not worth it."
0,"WOW, what a MASSIVE let down.  been going here for almost 20 years.  this place USED to be THE place for the wickedest mexican food, great service, and a total party..  Went the other friday, place was a ghost town (clue #1).  The guys hosting told us it would be 15 minutes (the place was only half full, clue #2), and THEN told us to wait outside in the heat!  I even asked if they even wanted us there and he flat out said \""I don't care\"".  Considering the location and my past fondness, our party of 8 stayed... I had been talking this place up to my friends from Peru and Colombia.  Should have known from the start...the food ended up being lously...and not a little, 4 of us got no sleep from cramping.  I think they scraped the bottom of the barrel for our red sauce, it looked more like spicy red paste.\n\nSad to say this is the end of an era for me, I WILL NEVER go back.  This was the only restaurant I would welcome a 1 hour wait for a table at...no longer.  The sisters use to run it, one of them past a few years back, and now it looks like the boys are running...don't waste your time, the Los Dos Molinos of old that got all the great reviews is dead."
1,"This is a great place recently remodeled and great service for get the fast food i think best fast fast food. always they give you all the necessary items without asking. Manager lady is super nice and, she knows how to keep the place busy and clean.."
1,"I was really hesitant to rent from a Budget, after reading all the negative reviews on the other Budget locations in Vegas, but decided to give this location a shot, since we wanted to rent a car that was somewhat near the strip (since we werent getting it from the airport).  I really liked that you can arrange their shuttle to pick you up and drop you off at your hotel, so it made renting from them very convenient.  The guy who picked us up was very friendly and talked to us the whole time of all the various places (both tourist locations and unique places to explore). \nservice was fine, picked up and dropped off at hotel\n\nI also checked our credit card bill afterwards, and did not see any surprise added fees either, so I would recommend this place."
0,"Out of fried pickles, both seasonal canned beers, out of flagship IPA, one chef, five tables, server knew nothing about beer - just in general- know what's on your menu! Sucked and won't return, my melt was so greasy and um, no cheese. What is a melt? this place is not somewhere I'd recommend- sad because I live right beside it!"
1,"Good wine, good appetizers and a great atmosphere. I am always looking forward to a girls night out here."
1,"i've always wanted to splurge & stay here.  old school, themed, strip casino. classy. very nice casino.  high-end mall w/a cheesecake factory chain restaurant. compliments the hella-classy  neighboring bellagio w/a linking walkway.  worth a look if you haven't visited. i enjoy their table games."
0,"I've been on a major taco kick lately, and while the tacos here are fine, it's the sum of the experience that results in the 2-star review. I'd say I've dined-in here for lunch/dinner at least 10-times since my earlier review.\n\n- Chips are horrendous\n+ Salsa is ok - nice, steady heat, but oh so watery\n+ Campechano tacos are outstanding (steak + chorizo mix)\n+ Great tortillas\n+ Generous amounts of cilantro and onion with the tacos (yay!)\n+ Steak and pastor = excellent\n- Chicken = usually dry\n\n- Service is so spotty, Dalmatians, Cheetahs, and Leopards get jealous. The servers immediately drop off chips/salsa and then want to take your order *on the spot*. After they take your order, your food will arrive quickly, and you'll never see anyone, ever again, until you need to pay your tab. It's bizarre. Need some more water? Need a fork? Need another taco? Good luck. You're on your own.\n\n- They reverted to the \""get your own drinks from the cooler in the grocery store\"" service. Which is fine, but... all of the beers require a bottle opener... and the servers are no where to be found, so after you hike over to grab your own beer, you wind-up sitting for a while, staring at your beer, hoping someone will come by to provide an opener. \n\n- The return to the \""get your own drinks\"" started this week (12/29). I was there three days ago, and they served drinks without sending anyone to the cooler. When I asked why there was the shift, they said, \""We have never served drinks to the tables - you always have to get yours.\"" I argued (lightly) for a bit about past experiences, but then they pulled the, \""Sorry, I don't understand\"" act. Ugh.\n\n- If you order a Michelada (beer + tomato juice and hot sauce), they'll serve it to you... this makes zero sense to me.\n\nSo, why am I complaining about the beer thing? Because it's not clear who to pay for your drinks... the beer comes from a cooler in the grocery store; the food comes from the little restaurant area. When I went to pay for my dinner, there was much confusion about how I needed to pay for the beer... it took a solid 5-minutes to get out of there today... \n\nFactor in the time spent staring (longingly) at said beer while waiting for an opener, and I'm left a bit sour on this place. They eventually determined I needed to pay them for the drink, but crikey. What a mess.\n\nNot sure I'll be back as often or as soon as I have been."

0,"I too was lured in by the tasty sample, however I was never told that I could buy single cup of tea to go and drink, I would have liked to do that at least. \nI was instead told that minimum tea purchase was 2.oz. and the tea that I was interested in would have cost me around $20! \nNO THANKS. \n\nI don't need that much tea and seriously am not going to save soggy leaves to re-steep another time. \n\nI would have liked to buy just enough for a few glasses of tea. \n\nSorry Teavana I will be going elsewhere."
0,"I'm not sure why everyone is posting anything positive for this salon. I had gone here with a schedule appointment for me and 3 other girls. We showed up slightly early and they had taken 2 girls before us that were getting their pedicures finished. We didn't think anything of it because they said they were almost done. Mind you, we told them when scheduling the appointment that we were on a time crunch so we would book if they could guarantee that there would be 4 technicians so we could all get our pedis/manis done at the same time. They had said it would not be a problem. We waited for about 30 minutes until the owner came over and said we could get started soaking at the mani station for one girl. The technicians then informed her that we couldn't because the 2 girls they had taken before us were getting manis now too. So, then my girl had to sit in a random chair soaking her nails for no reason. Then they set me and another girl up in the pedi station. We sat with our feet in the water only to look down and realize that the bubbles in the water had dead skin floating in it. Absolutely unsanitary and disgusting. Most nail salons I go to put a disposable plastic tub inside of the tub so there is no issue of this. Once we saw this and realize that we were waiting for 45 minutes with no beginning in sight we soon left and headed to Biagio down the street. WAY better and more sanitary!"
0,"If you care for your life, do not visit this practice. After giving you an appointment they make you wait for 2 hrs. I have visited this practice 3-4 and had to wait 2 hrs everytime. Doctors are horrible. My doctor did not do my biopsy correctly and it had to be redone. So that was horrible. When I moved out of state, I requested my medical records for continuing treatment because I have a serious medical issue. Its been four weeks and no action has been taken. I have left 50+ voice mails. No one picks up the call. They call back only once every 24 hrs between 9 am and 10 am in the morning. Technically they work 9-5, but they never answer calls and do not call back. I am considering legal/other actions against them , because I fear that lack of records can interrupt my treatment plans at my new location. Never use this practice."
0,"First, let me start by saying I go out in the Arcadia and Biltmore areas a lot.  So, for the sake of the community and having more choices, I wanted to like The Grind - heck, I wanted to love it!  But...I have to say my first visit to The Grind for a meal will probably be my last.\n\nI went here for lunch with a friend, although it was actually just after the lunch rush, around 2pm.  The place was virtually empty, so at the very least, we could enjoy great service, right?!  Nope.  Not only did neither of us enjoy our meals - I love sweet potatoes, but don't even think about ordering the sweet potato fritters here - but I felt like we were twisting our waitress' arm any time she came over to help us.\n\nI don't enjoy writing bad reviews, so I'll just stop here.  I wouldn't recommend The Grind unless it's just for a drink (I liked the look of the beer selection on the menu) and someone else you're with really wants to go."
1,"Stopped here by accident last year on my way to pumpkin picking at Gilcrease Orchard. We saw the sign out front advertising a pumpkin patch... so naturally, we had to stop. \n\nThe Farm is not really so much a farm, but more just a house with the yard converted into a veggie stand and something reminiscent of a farm. The backyard (which guests can see, but not go in) has goats, a giant pig, and chickens. Chickens and barn cats walk around freely with the guests, and there are cages throughout housing rabbits and baby birds. \n\nI was beyond excited when we came in last October. Growing up in Pittsburgh, I loved the fall and everything that came with it. This place had pumpkins and squash galore and dried corn stalks like we used to put out for Halloween when I was little!  Who knew something as silly as a corn stalk would make me so happy? We ended up spending a ton of time here looking at the animals and picking out the perfect pumpkin to carve. \n\nWe came back a few more times last fall, and just recently again this weekend while stopping at Gilcrease. Right now they have the best tomatoes and some summer squashes. I'm guessing in the next couple weeks they'll start to get their fall squashes (they carry dozens of varieties, some I had never heard of until I stopped last year). Did I mention that there's baby chickens running around right now? Well, there are. \n\nBesides produce, they also sell local honey, homemade jellies and pickles, and eggs straight from the chickens running around at your feet. I just bought some eggs yesterday but have yet to try one. I believe they have farm land in Utah, which is where they get their produce. I'm not 100% positive though, so don't take my word on it. \n\nYou should definitely make a stop here sometime and check this place out. Don't get too excited...again, it's just a house and a yard so don't be expecting tons of produce or a giant red barn with cows and horses. It's a sweet little place with very kind owners. \n\nWith all the animals, kids eat this place up....make sure you bring them!"
0,"Fun enough for a nerd bar. Downtown is being revitalized and I do enjoy hanging out at Vanguard on occasion. I'll only come to Insert Coins if some sort of birthday party is going on and I \""have to\"" go. The machines here tend to eat quarters, it's very crowded and the air conditioning sucks.\n\nFriends have purchased tables on a couple occasions and every person has left with a bill at least 200% over what they were quoted. So BEWARE of the bottle girls... If you're going to buy bottles, be careful or just spend your $1,000 at the club! At least you'll be surrounded by semi-well dressed men and women and decent music.\n\nDrinks are affordable and they have a decent variety of beer. Be prepared to wait in line. I've heard waits can be as long as 45 minutes to an hour on First Fridays.  \n\nAnd to my underage readers, don't come here on a busy night. They'll find any reason in the book to turn your under 21 butt away and snatch your fake from you. This place is more difficult to get into than XS."
0,"Summary: Attended Wick Spoon for a wedding so really I don't know how much it is per head and I don't intend to find out. The setting was dark which I don't understand why, do they not want us to see what we're eating? But after sampling majority of their food I assume the darkness is so other guest doesn't see me split out the food.\n\nFood: Their weekend dinner selection was below average. Nothing stand out or mind blowing. The only thing I can actually compliment on was their salmon which wasn't bland and their shrimp cocktail. The sauce was different. It was sweet and sour at the same time and the taste wasn't too strong on the palate. I would avoid the desert section, flavorless and full of sugar. \n\nService: The staff was very friendly though. I don't know was it because we book a private room so we have personal server but they were very attentive and always on time to refill our beer and wine. The staff was very professional throughout our stay which I understand can be tough at times especially you know, asian and their endless alcohols. \n\nOverall: Of all the buffet I experience in Vegas, I think I'll stick with Bellagio for the time being until someone recommend we try a new place. But definitely Wick Spoon is off the table permanently."
0,"Frankly, I am astounded this place has gotten the reviews it has.\n\nI guess, overall, its not an entirely hateful place.  I was able to get in immediately with a ladies VIP pass despite there being a huge crowd outside, and the music wasn't totally ridiculous.  I had a couple of drinks that were reasonably mixed and weren't too overpriced.  Um........ I think that's about it for the good things\n\nOn to the bad things - this place is freakin small man.  like ridiculous for a place calling itself a nightclub.  maybe it was the night i was there, about a week after their grand opening and on a Sunday, but it was so packed i don't think i even got on the actual dance floor till after 1am.  there was a stupid amount of females in there compared to males.  like other people have mentioned, the dress code was totally random.  i saw a lady, not a girl, a grown ass lady in there with some dirty aerobic walking shoes like she had been to every point on the strip that day.  craziness.  the bathroom is outside of the club, so not only did i put off going until the very last moment, but once i got there i had to force myself to go back into the club - the damn casino, with its free drinks, was right there calling.  and finally, maybe it's just me, but i never located this alleged patio outside area.  and no i don't drink that much, its just extremely dark in there and they had one security guy in particular i didn't feel like going near.  maybe that was the door outside, who knows.\n\nanyway, this would be a good place to start off a night, provided you were already in TI.  I guess if you had bottle service this joint wouldn't be so bad, those areas looked pretty decent and are not like right on top of the dance floor so you can enjoy yourselves.  i personally wouldn't make a special trip here though, even for free admission."

Totally worth it.  \n\nThis year, not so good.  I am near the end of my 2nd year membership, there were only maybe 2,3 shows in the past year that were not too bad.  I ended up didn't go to any show in my 2nd year.\n\nDefinitely will not extend my membership."
0,"I waited in a ridiculous line even though I had bottle service. After waiting a half hour in line, I was walked up to a table and met my waitress. She was very nice. Caution: this place is very expensive. I'm talking $20 a shot! After we finished our bottle of champagne which cost around $600, our table was cleaned off and we were told the table was going to be used for other guests! We were treated like animals after we went to the roof top, making us wait in line to get in the exiting elevator. I realize it's Vegas, but I at least expected to keep my table so I could rest my feet for the night. No such luck. Be advised! They will boot you out!"
0,"In hopes that TGI's would bring a little more to the table then what Sam's Town puts out...wishful thinking. I would much rather head out to the food-court, order a Big Mac and watch that howling wolf, then to spend $30 at this place again. \n\nI have generously given them an extra star due to the \""major crisis\"" our server claimed they were experiencing during our visit. Needless to say, it took a good while to get menus, and twice as long to get drink orders in. \n\nWe ordered Buffalo Wings from their Happy Hour. Wings were cold and had an odd flavor. The fries came later when we were almost finished eating our Wings. They were SO salty, we ended leaving the entire basket. Our Mozzarella sticks were delicious, and earned a whole whoopin star for great taste and freshness!! Cheese was fresh and stringy, just like a cheese stick should look. \n\nOther than our cheese sticks, everything about this location was below average."
0,"My co-workers and I work downtown and we attempted to order a late lunch from Kabob Korner today, and let me just say I have never experienced such poor customer service in my life! I don't know who answered the phone but we were advised that they were out of hamburgers, hotdogs, philly cheese steaks, chicken fingers, basically everything on the menu. When politely asked what was available on the menu the gentleman advised that he didn't have time to go through the menu and became agitated. After attempting to explain that we were not trying to be complicated just attempting to place an order the gentleman stated \""hurry up you are taking to much time and we have other people waiting to order!\"" Thank you but no thank you we will no longer be ordering lunch from this establishment."
1,I can't say enough good things about this place--my new fave in town!  This restaurant is VERY gluten free friendly!  My fiance needs gluten free food and they were incredibly knowledgable and had a great GF menu.  Their food was so flavorful and reasonably priced.\n\nHappy hour and Monday specials were great--a really great deal on mussels and 1/2 off a bottle of wine.  There's another day of the week where the deal is buy one burger get one free!  \n\nWe also loved the fries because they came with a great garlic aioli sauce.  \n\nThe atmosphere is a great casual pub style atmosphere.\n\nOur server was incredibly friendly and checked on and recommended various GF items--so wonderful!
0,"Can you say old, tired, and dated??\n\nUnfortunately, the MGM has seen its brightest days go and pass. As we walked into the lobby, half of the entire space was sectioned off (possibly for remodeling?). \n\nThe hotel felt like a construction zone! Seriously. One of pet peeves is keeping something open while trying to do an extensive remodel. It simply doesn't work! I don't know why anyone would stay here with all the hammering, noise, and dust. The lobby basically has nothing fun to do in it. The hotel is also on the end of the strip making it harder to get to where the action is (Cosmopolitan, Bellagio, Planet Hollywood, Paris).  They even took away the live tigers (which were the only reason to make a trip to the MGM).\n\nLet's hope this remodel is a complete overall of the hotel. Otherwise, I think MGM has seen its better days.\n\nMGM Resorts should focus on their flagship properties that are actually modern and entertaining. (It is embarrassing in my opinion to have a resort open with your flagship MGM branding on it that is subpar to most of the other resorts on the strip.)"
0,"Read about this new BBQ place in town on VegasChatter.com so went to check it out for lunch. The pulled pork sandwich was delicious and the best part of our experience here. I would recommend it. I ordered the chili on the side instead of on top of my sandwich. Good call because I didn't like the chili at all. Everything else we ordered was mediocre. Rib tips weren't very tasty. The sides were a disappointment and here's why - melted styrofoam! Gross! I dumped the baked mac and cheese onto my plate to find the styrofoam cup was melted on the inside! That CAN'T be healthy! Same happened with the sweet potato casserole. Hard to judge whether these sides were good because we were grossed out by the melted styrofoam and didn't want to eat it for fear of getting sick. The baked beans also came in a styrofoam cup which didn't melt and tasted just ok. I know this place's roots are from a food truck, but it's time to get rid of the styrofoam! It's literally IN my food AND not earth-friendly. And you don't even need the styrofoam! The sides could be placed directly on the plate. Texas toast would be better if they buttered and seasoned BOTH sides of the bread. Fun to see Kool-Aid on the beverage menu and the smoker right out front! I truly hope they do well and work out the kinks because it has much potential!"
0,"I'll start from the top. \nI called for a reservation and the hostess said \""the restaurant isn't even halfway full, so it doesn't really matter what time you come\"". Should have been a red flag.\nWhen we got there, it appeared that the hostess didn't know what to do with us....she stood holding menus staring into \""not even half-full\"" dining room for a good couple of minutes. We ended up at a pretty nice table though and the waiter came over right away. However, the very little english he spoke was barely understood as he whispered his way though his introduction. The drink order ended up being 2 glasses of white wine, a glass of red wine and a beer. 15 minutes later, he came with 3 glasses of white wine. Um...\nWe corrected him and he got us the right drinks and took our food orders. I ordered the pork chop and strongly emphasized my desire to have it very well done. All the while straining to hear his broken english. \nThe food came, my pork was pink throughout. My fiance's steak was rare (he asked for medium) and his father's gravy was that out of a McCormick's dry seasoning package from the grocery store. I sent back the pork to have it cooked further and they, kindly enough, took it off the check because the waiter was clearly in the wrong. There was this \""apple chutney\"" on the chop and anyone could've given me a side of canned apples with cinnamon flavoring and I wouldn't have been able to tell the difference. The mashed potatoes were cold and had questionable chucks in it, that I really don't think were just un-mashed potato and the asparagus tasted like dirt. \nThey gave us a free appetizer coupon because of the trouble, which was also a nice gesture but to be completely honest, I don't know that we'll ever go back there. Maybe just to drink and as long the person waiting on us knows the difference between red and white wine. We'll wait til they start washing their veggies before we ever eat there again though...."
0,"1 Star, only because I can't give a minus star.\n\nHORRIBLE COMPANY. They are uncaring and their employees are awful. They are lacking in both empathy and kindness. It is a travesty they dare to manage age restricted communities because they have no business managing communities where older people reside. RMI has no consideration for the challenges older people endure. Snarky, condescending, curt, mean-spirited, thoughtless and just plain rude people. Unprofessional, uncaring, a blight on HOA Management. Like many management companies all they care about is how they can bring money into their company while hurting homeowners in their communities who pay HOA dues that pay for this company's management. Buyer beware to all who have the misfortune to own within an RMI-managed community. And by the way, RMI personnel, some day you will be older with the physical challenges and limitations that accompany aging. Hopefully you will never be subjected to the lack of kindness exhibited by RMI Management. This company is shameful and if you are a BOD looking to hire a management company, do your research!\n\nOut of all the filtered reviews only a couple are positive. Out of 6 published reviews only 1 positive review. Makes you wonder, doesn't it? \n\nLooks like homeowners and renters within RMI managed companies are not very satisfied with the service this company provides. That speaks for itself when the majority of reviews of a company are negative."
0,"Wow... I was so disappointed.  I consider myself a Cirque snob as I have seen about a dozen of their road shows and I will only sit in the first five rows.  Minus one other show, I have always left in awe wondering how the heck those acrobats do what they do.  I was so excited about going to Ka as my boyfriend had never been to any Cirques and I talked it up so much. We sat in the front row but that did not help the show.  I was bored from the beginning but kept telling myself it had to get better!  My boyfriend actually fell asleep it was so dull.  I enjoy Cirque for their unsurpassed acrobatic abilities and this show had none.  Minus the death defying guy on the spinning wheel, nothing left me breathless as so many of their other shows have.  And on that note, we were talking to someone who went to Zarkana and he was talking about the same performance on the spinning wheel and how they made pictures out of sand.  Come on.... they have the same act in two shows and they have the sand images?  I saw that on America's Got Talent.  Cirque is SO above that.  I'm beginning to think Cirque just doesn't have the WOW factor left in them."
0,"I was looking forward to the biscuit's and gravy, so I request a sample before I ordered ( just to make sure I'd like it) and was not impressed, it was loaded with pepper and not really creamy. I opted for the corn beef hash. It was straight from a can, the potatoes were hard and muffin slightly burnt. The eggs were good though and I liked the coffee. I won't be back as the service was beyond slow, and they were NOT that busy to justify it. I went as fellow yelpers claimed it was the greatest biscuit's and gravy, I guess it's made different in the Pacific Northwest."
0,"Bad night?  Can you have bad nights?  Can I give you bad bills?\n\nCraftsteak has a great reputation and I need to believe this is true.  As Tom C. would say on Top Chef, \""Everyone has a bad day.\""  Unfortunately, at ~$100 per person, you should get it right the first and every time.\n\nMy salad was leafy with little flavor.  I suppose it's hip nowadays to squeeze a lemon on greenery and call it a salad. My filet mignon was overcooked, cold and tough.  My scallops were also cold.  My risotto was forgotten altogether, but that was a plus because it was rushed out and warm upon arrival.  The highlight of the evening was Craftsteaks Monkey Bread dessert.  This is great, but the restaurant isn't called, 'Craftbread.'\n\nI have to believe it was a bad night.  I would like return, but at their prices and so many options, I'll move on..."
1,"Visited for dinner and while it was not very busy on a Saturday evening.  We ordered a Pizza and a Strumboli and gosh we were pleasantly surprised.  \n\nThe personal pizza was wonderfully presented, excellent thin crust that was well done and with topping that were both fresh and bursting with flavor.  The size of the pizza was more in ines of a Personal Plizza Plus :).  \n\nThe  Strumboii was a piece of art.  Never have I seen such a thin crust hold a plethora of sausage.  Most Strumboli's are quite hollow inside and lack much of a meat, but this was certainly one for the history books.\n\nGotta end on a sweet note and tis been ages since I have tasted a cannoli that is so fresh and so flavorful.\n\nI will surely visit again when I am in the area as it truly a hidden gem."
0,"Italian, hardly. Tomatoes and cashews in a chiffinade of romaine lettuce, store bought ceasear dressing salad for appetizer, dinner was slab of burnt, frozen patty veal parm with store bought diner sauce, the wife had frozen ravioli with tons of bay scallops and store bought sauce.  If you got drunk at the bar it might taste good. Sit away from the loud piano."
1,"I'm a bit hooked.  I think it's because 316 has the feeling of bars I've been to in Boston or Providence.  \n\nI really like the direction that 316 is going. Granted, I've only lived in Charlotte for a year, but it seems to be constantly reinventing itself. This isn't a dance club by any means, but has more of a feeling of being in someones two story, swanky living room. \n\nThe remodel on the ground floor has created an intimate piano bar/lounge area - and the bar on the ground floor which is generally empty now seems to actually serve a purpose! I went last night to check out the piano bar and was pleasantly surprised. Grandiose, hilarious drag queen singing musicals + $3 well drinks = a delightful Monday night. \n\nI usually go Fridays when it's busier, but it was kind of refreshing to try something new. Karaoke on Tuesdays draws a good crowd as well. \n\nThe beer selection isn't that great, but Blue Moon is always a good standby. Excellent, attentive staff, and the owners make a habit of making an appearance at and behind the bar."
0,"I could give this a 0 star if I could.\n\nSo they pulled me aside to question me about my year of graduating high school, etc. etc., procedures for a fake I'm guessing & threatened to call the police & confiscate my only ID if I didn't \""tell the truth\"" so I was forced to make up a fake birthday by saying I was 2 years younger in order to get my ID back & was told to leave the grounds. This was also for an event I had already pre-paid $50 for.\n\nEven worse, my friend who merely two days later with an actual FAKE ID who, although she is 20, looks far from it managed to enter the same venue for another pre-paid event. I thought Las Vegas, out of all places, would be used to properly identifying people of drinking age.\n\nOf course, I came back and watched the show from another pool but I suggest either getting better security guards who can actually distinguish fakes from real and maybe even buy, god forbid, a black light or ID scanner - because for a major company that would be so expensive!\n\nOne last thing, I was threatened to be blacklisted from all MGM owned places (which apparently is 75% of the Strip). I really don't care about any of these places so their words fell empty and I just felt harassed for absolutely no reason. Good job taking my money and leaving me without an experience I had been waiting for for months."
1,"Best way to travel in the trip. Saves money and time. Very Good Air-conditioning keeps you cool and protected from the hot weather outside giving a perfect way to enjoy the view of the strip. \n\n1) It would be great to have the same kind of ticket machines in all stops as not all bus stops vend all ticket types. And, some accept cash, some don't; some accept cards, but some don't\n2) The machines are hidden in the rear in many of the stops. We could see people scrambling around to see where's the machine. Adding a board pointing to where the machine is, would be helpful. \n3) It is confusing which door to board. Deuce boards you from front door. But people get confused when they transfer from the other bus Strip and downtown Express(Route SDX) which allows to board from rear doors as well. There can be a common way of boarding the bus."
0,"Horrible place!!!  Went on a Tuesday night about 12:00am.  Stayed for about an hour.  My bros and I dropped $170 and didn't see one topless girl.  Place was empty. Nasty girls sat in our lap, argued about price and left pissed off that we wouldn't pay $400 for a lap dance.  One guy in my party gave each of them a $20 for their time.  They were still pissed.  No one danced on stage.  Place sucked big time...don't waste your time!"
0,The chicken tenders had a weird rubbery texture and this was the second time so no more for me.
1,"I have have had my cars serviced at Jakes for over 20 years. I recently took my car in for service and as always, the work was done correctly, at the quoted price, and on time.  I highly recommend them for service to any one and have sent many people there for honest and complete service."
1,"Welcome to Asian Island, home of some of the best Chinese take-out in Tucson--uh, I mean, home of some of the really good Chinese take-out in Phoenix. For SEVEN MONTHS, I have been deprived of fan-worthy Chinese food. Good grief. T-Town should come with a disclaimer: \""The city of Tucson lacks 4 and 5-star Chinese restaurants.\"" I've been hunting around for a while now, and then on my first attempt at Chinese in Phoenix, I experience a satisfying victory.\n\nFor Americanized Chinese food, this place is freaking good. They have $8 dinner combos for the win, which come with a super-portioned dish, a spring roll, and two crab cakes. The crab cakes are delicately formed as bite-size pieces of art, with crisp upward facing wings. Fresh-fried bites of love with a comforting, creamy, white inside. The spring rolls are likewise fresh-fried. They have a juicy inside and a wonderfully flaky outside. Mm. And the General Tsao's is (a) huge, HUGE (portion) - too much for one person, even if said person has a hefty appetite. It's not as saucy as hubs prefers, but it sure is tasteful. Like so many other places, the chicken is tenderly excellent, while it's breading is slightly too saturated (missing the crispy oomph).\n\nI especially appreciate Asian Island's transparent kitchen wall, which allows guests to peek in while the cooks do their thang. So get on in there and watch how they fresh-fry all their shtuff."
1,"Mom and pop ice cream shop with some flavors to entice the American crowd but they also have some assorted Asian flavors (mango, young coconut, ube labelled as taro).  I'm not sure what brand of ice cream they are serving, but it is rich and creamy.  I sampled the taro and the mango.  The taro tastes similar to the Magnolia brand one, but the one I ended up getting in a waffle cone was the mango. The mango ice cream tastes like Philippines brand dried mango (not hard and chewy though), but the owner informed me the mangoes come from Cebu for the ice cream.  Besides just ice cream, they also have cronuts and macarons in assorted flavors and candy treats for the kids! I like that they also serve the ice cream in these ice cream sundae glasses for those who want to eat the ice cream in the shop. A definite hole in the wall gem tucked into this Silverado ranch strip mall."
0,"Heard so many good things about this place and its prime rib steak that I was disappointed. My cousins are always saying that the prime rib steak is amazing.\n\nI had it but it was far too salty. I later found out that I should have had it cooked in the \""slow roasted\"" method but went for Outback Style - basically peppery. It was very salty and very peppery. I tried someone elses Prime Rib steak which was cooked in \""right\"" way and it was OK - nothing to write home about.\n\nAlso, heard that the bread they give you was brilliant too. Just tasted like normal bread with slightly different (to England anyway) butter."
0,"I have to say the food at this place is quite delicious, however, the service is absolutely terrible!!! The plates are HUGE and portions are generous. Just be prepared for your server to not be super peppy."
0,"I have been to the WW in Asheville I Guess more than 30 times always great food service and drinks. BUT... there is something about The WW At this location and one other it seems like it must be KFC.\n      IT all started about 230pm I guess I had passed by this location a few times but, decided to stop. They had a all u can eat wing and soup I think (I am trying to forget). FIRST THE SERVER DID NOT HAVE A CLUE. So I get to the buffet line 4 dried out wings and no soup. I stopped 2 employees and asked about the food they looked at me like I was from MARS...I and I guess 4 people waited for wings nothing came out. I LEFT 3 dollars on the table for the tea and was out of there. I CALLED THE PLACE a few moments later and spoke with a bartender who sounded like he was on crack that said he was 'in charge right now\""HE kept repeating over and over what I was saying so there must have been some sort of medication... issue so I hung up.\n           I called their Corp office and spoke with \""David\"" who said he was a district manager he said the bartender should not have been in charge and laughed about it   ????After he tried to sweep it under the rug he invited me to another location and told me it would be better and after about 3 weeks sent me a letter with a gift card..\n          So after about a month I was stuck in traffic pulled off and decided to give then one more chance... NOT goin to go into the terrible service while there you can message me if anyone wants details.. Anyway got wings to go got home opened the bag and a ROACH CRAWLED OUT DAMM. !!!!!! I called the CORP GUY and he said there is no bugs in that store...I ASKED HIM THEN WHAT JUST CRAWLED OUT A CHICKEN WING?

1,This store is the only Nail salon I will ever go too. Tim has been doing my nails for over 3 years now and his wife Kim is amazing too! They know how to take care of their customers and are vary professional. I love this place!
1,"First I will tell the good , most important, the burgers were awesome! Lots of choices. The bad, the staff, sorry. They were not awful but seemed so scattered. We didn't see our server much but saw a lot of other staff. 3 different people brought out our food. Also we had the living social deal that was 2 burgers 2 sides and 2 drinks. My friend never got his side and was too polite to say something so we all shared. Also people around us were complaining they didn't get their order right. We would go back but only if in the area, (we live in Gilbert) if we would have payed full price we would have made sure everyone got all their food. Would be 5 stars if they work out the staff stuff."
0,"Used to come here with an exboyfriend when it was under a different owner. Back then, it was our \""go-to\"" Indian takeout place.  Nothing made me happier than grabbing takeout on the way home and we could settle in for a relaxing night in of food coma and great television.  Sadly, much like that relationship, all good things eventually come to an end.  In this case, the new restaurant is okay but not great.  The to-go orders tend to get mixed up,  (Chicken Korma instead of Chicken Tikki given), but my biggest gripe is that the naan is not nearly as good as it once was.  Naan is now overly chewy and doughy.  Maybe its been the few times I've come in, but when the naan isn't great, it breaks my heart.  Oh and the spiciness factor seems to be off.  i.e. its either way spicy, or way bland."
0,"Do not use this place! Without repeating the story of 49 bucks on top of te deal price, I just had a bad feeling about ye guys. It's one of those guys \"" you pay me 49 bucks I take care o'you no problems lifetime warranty\"" fast talking scammer. I let him and decided to slow him down and repeat that 5 windows of my choice will be tinted according to the deal no need for 49 bucks no BS. He started talking fast again and made no sense. ( can't express how much I hate that). Listen Dude pretending to look busy while you are not has only one outcome - out of business. This town runs on providing service and its mind boggling how some morons forget that!"
1,"Great little park. I run or walk around the small path, a few times a week. There's a small playground for kids, tennis courts, basketball, two baseball fields. There's and a small workout section. Most days it's pretty quiet unless the little league has set up shop (usually Wednesday around 5pm or 6pm)\n\nOn most weekends you'll find families staking out the lone grill. But if you can keep a secret there's actually a small grill off to the side near a singular table. \nTonight there was a kid practicing the clarinet. I'm not sure how good he was, as I had my Pandora turned up."
0,"I had high hopes for this restaurant but was sadly disappointed. \n\nThe service was so-so, not very attentive to our table of 12 (maybe because gratuity would already be included). The waiter seemed a little annoyed that we asked for more rolls, but the food was taking forever. \n\nBut I can handle bad service as long as the food is good!\n\nExpecting bold and flavorful Cajun/Creole, I was completely underwhelmed. The food was so bland everyone at the table was disappointed. Not only were the prices on the higher end, the portions were small and the flavor was severely lacking.  \n\nI would not recommend nor visit Table 10 again."
0,"I generally speaking love subway, but this was my first experience with this store. . . And by far was the WORST experience I've had.  I wanted to rate this at one star, but the general consensus of the party I was with was two stars.   Congratulations to this company, here are four people that will tell about their low quality service and food.  \n\nThey got right on making our food, but the level of responsiveness while making it was. . Subpar.  When they ASKED me if I wanted my sandwich toasted, I said no, and (this seems to be a running theme with subway) they toasted it anyway.  I think they blanket toast ALL of their sandwiches, even when someone knows that they are not going to eat it right away, so if its toasted, the meal, when eaten, will be some sort of sad lukewarm.  \nEvery condiment was flavorless, and the entire thing was lukewarm and bland.  I don't think they added any salt when I asked. There were really no upsides to my sandwich. Or my experience. I wouldn't ever return to this store, especially since there is a GREAT Subway right down the road at Val Vista and Baseline.  Go there instead!"
1,"After receiving a confirmation email that I had made the list to attend the Yelp Elite Event \""Dia de Los Muertos\"" to be held at Barrio Queen, I contemplated on getting a Sugarskull makeover, but where would I go for something like this?  I asked a coworker who did body painting and received a quote from her, but there was a question of whether the products she used would be safe for me to try, so I put the thought away.  The next day, I remembered that mall department stores offered makeovers all the time, and then I thought of Sephora's makeover stations that I never tried.  What a perfect time to do so, I thought, so I made the call.  The woman on the phone asked if I had photos of the look I wanted, and I said I'd bring some, and I asked for a time estimate.  She said an hour.  I made an appointment for 4:30p, but as it turned out, I arrived early and was introduced to Amber, who was to be my custom makeup artist.  \n\nAmber was very amiable, conversational, and excited to do something out-of-the-ordinary, which made the whole process of getting a makeover very fun!  I have sensitive skin, as well as food and environmental allergies that keep me from using foundation and many products, so I was nervous about the possibility of negative reactions to any of the products we were going to try, but the only problem I encountered was a mild itch on my nose- not enough for me to want to run to the nearest sink and wash off all the products!  The whole process took about two hours**, and Amber answered all of my questions throughout.  I received many compliments at the Dia de los muertos party I attended, despite the fact that attendees could receive COMPLIMENTARY makeup from an artist present at the party.  (I was even approached by a mother with a young girl at the end of the event who wanted photographs taken with me!)  At least I knew that I was using quality products designed for surgical patients through Amber and Sephora!  (Not to say that the artist there wasn't using quality products, but with party time constraints, I wouldn't have been able to ask her all I needed to know to avoid skin reactions.  All that had their makeup done with her looked terrific!)\n\nI would like to schedule more makeovers at Sephora so that I may learn how to achieve certain looks, as well as try out new products, and I will ask for Amber again, or someone she recommends I try.\n\n*Please note that there is a $50 minimum purchase associated with a custom makeover.\n\n**Amber went above and beyond her duties as a Sephora makeup artist when she assisted in applying tattoo decals I had purchased elsewhere, as well as allowed me to pay for products there at the CM station, rather than have me wait to pay at the cashier.  I had a terrific time!\n\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/sephora-scottsdale?select=lzZbOl2eBlmKOTWqdvF1Bw#lzZbOl2eBlmKOTWqdvF1Bw\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/sephora-scottsdale?select=HBeoahPFcVAb4fOWXm_q3A#HBeoahPFcVAb4fOWXm_q3A\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/sephora-scottsdale?select=VEWdri3QbWfQTv1ngN8Vbw#VEWdri3QbWfQTv1ngN8Vbw"

1,"Yes, by very virtue that this us in an airport, everything is overpriced. But fr a place that serves a captive audience, it's good.  Food comes in decent portions and is actually good. Bloody Marys, while pricey is good. Perfect balance of tomato, salt, spice and vodka."
0,"I was really looking forward to visiting this restaurant. \nI chose breakfast because it's the only time they have BEIGNETS :D \nHaving said that, I was more than a little disappointed with the service. \n\nI called an hour before I planned on being there, 9 am on Sunday, to ask if it was necessary to have a reservation. The answer was \""ALWAYS\""... I thought maybe I heard wrong or he misunderstood, because it sounded a bit rude, lol. I made my reservation & arrived to find the place nearly empty. I told them I had a reservation & I was simply told very curtly to \""sit at any table for 2\"", so I did as told :) I ordered a coffee & beignets, because that's what I came for & chatted with my companion while eating them. About 10 the waiter came by & asked if there was anything else he could do for us as he cleared everything out from under our noses,,,,, believe me when I that everything about him was saying \""get out if you're not going to order anything else\"". We laughed it off & went on our merry little way. I figured he was having an off day, happens to everyone, until I read some of the other reviews & it sounds like he may be having a bad year,,, that happens too! \n\nI plan on going back for dinner. I'm hoping it is so delicious that it makes the service of no consequence :)\nIf I strike out the second time, there will be no going back!"

1,Well its been about my 4th time here now. So arrive 1:50pm. Was told they will close at 2:30pm to clean but we can stay while closed. We went ahead. I literally tried all there handrolls. Quality is good. Fresh taste. They had many variety of handrolls and fresh sushi. Many seafood items. Price have gone up. $23.95 for lunch now and that does not include soda. Anyways still worth the money since sushi is so expensive. Still the best sushi buffet i ever tried.
1,"Don't usually eat at buffets just because I am such a waste of money every time I go. Either I continuously eat the cheapest not worth it item at buffets or I just don't eat enough! Wicked Spoon was a buffet I had been wanting to try because everyone that goes to Vegas raves about this place! \n\nWe came here on a Sunday and the wait wasn't too bad. Since we came with such a big party, we had to pay all these tips and crap which probably made the cost about $30iish per person? \n\nThe seating arrangements here are spacious and there are event private dining rooms. Like any ordinary buffets there are different stations offering a variety of dishes. This buffet knows how to tempt you into eating everything because everything is plated so nicely. I didn't like everything....I swear I got so many things, took a bite, and then dumped it. My fave items are actually in this photo: \nhttp://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=r1S_vDd_m9Kg2Mdr1qSeKQ&userid=pmKnNkGVgzhMkwJaTU5apA\nYUMS to the yogurt and fried chicken. Such an odd combo but I had aboue 3 cups of that yogurt! It was just so addicting because it wasn't too sweet, and I felt healthy. \n\nThe Mac & cheese was really good too! I hated the pork belly buns though. I love pork belly buns, but after you've had it 5 star style elsewhere, going to Wicked Spoon for these buns just didn't meet up to that expectation. A lot of the foods here just looked better than it tasted. Kinda sad. \n\nI was going to give this place 3 stars, until I came across the gelato station! After I saw the Thai Tea Gelato, I was AUTOMATICALLY giving this place 4 stars. WTF THAI TEA? The last time I had Thai Tea flavored ice cream was in SF and they got rid of it....so I have been on the hunt for something like this....and it ends up being in Wicked Spoon?! WOW. The macaroons and other desserts didn't look as tasty as this gelato. It was so yummmmmmy I could've eaten more but I had portion control. \n\nBesides the average tasting food, I do give this place props for serving food nicely and maintaining such a pretty environment !"
1,"I was there and got two items out of the bakery case.  I don't know how they could improve upon them.\n\nThe Moreo was a large oreo-type confection.  The creamy center was excellent -- buttery and creamy at the same time, and a great complement to the cookies on the outside, which were baked perfectly.  Not cakey like a Whoopie Pie, and not crisp like a ginger snap -- just crisp enough with a bit of a chew.  The cookies didn't break apart when you bite into them, and that's important when you're eating on your bike.  Nice chocolatey flavor to the cookie part\n\nEven better was the lemon poppyseed cookie.  A dense cookie, with a great chew and mouthfeel.  And the lemon flavor was perfect.  Even better it was only $1.25!  Holy cats, if I lived nearby I'd be buying this daily.\n\nI'm glad I live 20 minutes away by bike.  This place could be seriously addictive.\n\nOne negative:  A fly was buzzing my legs as I waited to order.  Totally worth it for the baked goods though."

0,Went here for breakfast one day. No issues with the food it was standard diner fare but the slow was not even the word for the service. Needless to say we wound up walking the few extra minutes to Starbucks every other morning for the remainder of the trip and grabbed breakfast there instead.
0,"On the positive side as others have said the salon's design gorge. There is also a nice selection of products for purchase. But when it came down for my service I received color which I ended up not liking and having to go and get redone at another salon. On top of that I am not one who likes to leave a salon with wet hair so I opted to have the blow out as well. I knew that blow outs in strip salons can be pricey usually $75 to$ 95 dollars tops. But then when I went to pay I saw they charged me for an \""extensions\"" blowout   FOR $115!! I do have hair extentions but have never been charged more to dry them. That was insane. What a rip off!!! I have had extensions for years and have been getting blowouts for years and never have been up charged like that for a blowout. I was so mad that I just wanted to get out of there. Price is not worth the admission."
0,"I was really excited to take my sister here for her 18th birthday.  56 Reviews and 4 stars I thought for SURE it would be supreme.  I thought wrong.  I ordered soup which tasted like green pea colored baby mush. My sister ordered the salad which consisted of lettuce and a few decorations.  The entrees came out.  My sister got the duck entree which had 'OK' sauce, but literally, where was the duck?! Very small portions.  I ordered the fish special on the board.  No flavor whatsoever.  It was so disappointing. I NEVER add salt to my food, and that's all I was doing every single time a plate came out.  For dessert we had the cheesecake - which was NOT cheesecake.  It was some sort of whipped cream in the shape of a slice of cheesecake.  By this time, my sister and I had to crack of laughing because what else could we have suspected at this point.  The beer was good.  I would ONLY recommend the beer.  Everything else was overpriced and had no taste.  I felt like I was at a nursing home where they tried to make the food LOOK delicious even though it doesn't have ANY flavor because it doesn't matter anyway because many elderly lose their taste buds at that point anyway."
1,I have try this place again today Sunday night and the service was much better. Getting served by the GM awesome service and food.
0,"I cannot even begin to tell you how disgusted we were with our experience here.  We came here for our daughter's 18th birthday.  First, it took 15 minutes for our server to come to our table.  She was very energetic,  so we thought, \""Great! There is hope here!\""   WRONG.  We ordered appetizers and dinner and it took forever.  We decided 20 minutes in that we should get a cocktail,  but no one cam back to our table.  I had to get up and go to the bartender on duty to ask him to send someone over to refill our iced tea, soda and water.  He did.  Then we got our food.  Not how we ordered it, but it was delivered by an expeditor, so he had no idea.  No one came back to check.  It was not busy, so there was no excuse for this.  We couldn't even get our bill!!  I had to request our check from another stranger!  This place was ridicilous.  I requested to speak to the manager on our way out, and our server actually flipped out and wanted to \""discuss\"" it with me.  \n\nWe spent 80 dollars on our dinner.  It was absolutly not acceptable!"
0,"Your hotel is suppose to be my rock! my stone! yest when I check in and the room I reserved was \""all sold out\"" then surely in these dire ecomonic times you'd upgrade me ... especially at those prices ... whaaat? I need to pay $25 dollars more to get a room I didn't want - nah! - give me what you got -- oh you'll comp me a roll-a-way! oh wait I won't get it until 2 am becuz those are also \""all sold out\"" ... sure - I'll tell my guests to sleep on the floor becuz that's what your telling me! Pool was awesome, casino paid me at video black jack (yay)... would never stay again. idiots."
0,"I know there are quite a few reviews, and I'm not saying go or don't go.  I just can't seem to figure out the big draw of this place.  I was not impressed...at all.  Meh..for sure."
0,"Well I will say they helped my baby boy get out of pain... Thank You... The sick part about this place is that all they care about is $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$.. In order for them to even treat your dog they want 75% down.. Yes like we all have $3000 just laying around.. They are heartless and look down at you if your not rich.. The front desk staff is RUDE.. Your baby is in a world of hurt and all they can do is ask you for money, money and more money..."
1,"I went here for the first time on Saturday night. I had to go & try the famous Giant Fish Sandwich! When it arrived, I was impressed. The fish was even bigger than I expected & the batter was perfect. Also, the beer menu is lengthy! They serve beers from almost every corner of the world! I thought about trying something new, but turns out I was homesick for a good old Pennsylvania beer... :) Roland's is definitely a cool place in my book. I'll be back! :P"
1,"My son passed away in 2007, and they were very compassionate and helpful. We ordered an urn for him and picked it up and thought everything was fine with it. Recently, we noticed that my son's birthdate was wrong on it, so I called them on the phone and they not only apologized, but they replaced the urn for free and made it so that we could pick up the new urn near where we live now. I would recommend them to anyone looking for awesome customer service."
0,the waitress was nice but then again what waitress isnt \nwhen your in vegas.\nthe food was pretty predictable\nbland salsa & guacamole :(\nno refill on chips at all you gotta pay again for more chips!?!\nthats not cool.\nand almost everything besides the side orders are expensive\nsnd over-priced.\ni ordered the baked potato and it was very good for it being $4 \ncant beat that but dont expect a ehole meal at a decent price.
0,"My family and I had come here before and had superior service and very good food.  This last time, we got neither.\n\nOur waiter simply didn't like us.  There's no other explanation.  He ignored our repeated requests for more bread; he never once asked us if we wanted more water (I had to flag down the bus boy whenever he served the adjacent table, which was frequently).  He conversed with the customers at the other tables in our area, but didn't even bother to ask us how we were doing.  Two other parties arrived after us, yet they received their entrees before we did.  Once a large party had entered, he served them, and pawned us off to a bus boy.  \n\nI had ordered the veal parmigiana.  The cheese had not melted; it was still in a clump on top of the meat.  It was served lukewarm.  \n\nWe spent close to $90 on our meal.  That isn't how you treat people.\n\nI wish I would've taken a picture of the pr*ck so that I could say, \""If you see this guy, leave\"".  But maybe you shouldn't bother; just come back after they fire him.  He shouldn't last long.  If he does, the place will fold, and you wouldn't have missed much."
1,"We went on a Saturday afternoon, the decor was inviting. The staff wasn't  as friendly as some places we have been. However, they were not rude or anything. Just not overly friendly.The Rolls are good sized portions and the sauces are really yummy. Food overall was great!!!!!!"
0,"Went here on a Friday night with my fiance on 4/12 for drinks at around 5:30 PM and noticed upon entering that the pub was empty. We were seated by the hostess at a table where the sun blinded us, so we decided to move to a table right behind where we were placed. After about 10 minutes, we had still not been acknowledged by a server so I went back to the hostess and asked her if we could have someone take our orders. After another 5 minutes, our orders were finally taken. The food was decent but the service was absolute crap so I left her a dollar tip."
1,Nice place to grab a beer in Mesa.  Loved their IPA and porter.
0,"My boyfriend and I have been here a few times in the last 6 months and I don't know why we keep going back.   The food always tastes fairly good, however their service is horrible.   Our waitress, whom we've unluckily had the last 2 times we were there, is awful.  This recent time, my boyfriends specifically asked for no tomatoes on his burger, guess what it came with tomatoes.  Not a huge deal but would have been nice if it had been correct.   She never asked me once if I wanted another drink, but kept my boyfriends drinks refilled.   We finished our meal and sat there while she kept walking by us, clearly seeing I needed a to go box and never once asked. Finally I caught her and asked her for one.    I wish I could remember her name, blonde, hair in a ponytail all the time, young and clearly waitressing isn't her thing, otherwise she would have paid more attention to our needs.  If I had been paying she would have gotten zero for a tip, she didn't deserve one at all.   Then we went to go pay and leave, however stood and waited, and waited, and waited to even be waited on so we could go.  The cashier/waitress asked my boyfriend how his food was, but didn't ask me.   I think the place needs some work on their people and service skills.    Time to find a new location and give them a try.  We probably wont go back to this one anytime soon."
0,"I had never been here and decided to use a coupon from restaurant.com and check it out.  I pulled up into the parking lot and realized it was in a strip mall and there were only about 3 other cars total parked there.  I wasn't sure if it was open.  As I walked inside, I was still unsure.  My husband and I were the only ones there in the entire restaurant (besides the 1 waitress).  Eventually a few more people showed up.  The place needs some tlc. Its very outdated and worn. There was plenty of items from the menu that sounded appetizing and I was hoping this place was just a hidden gem.  I ordered a sampler of egg rolls, fried crab cheese, fried tofu and chicken satay.  Half of it came out burnt.  However, the thai iced tea was very good, and mine and my husband's main course came out hot and tasted fine.  Also, we were able to customize the spiciness of our food.  The waitress was friendly and I believe either a cook or the owner, unsure, came out to ask how everything was.  Overall, I wasn't overly impressed, probably won't come back.  I felt a little sorry for the place.  I can tell they try."
1,"A great way to escape the Arizona heat and a great chance to practice your New York accent. I am a full blooded New Yorker on tour in a reggae band, and this spot brought be right back to butter & rainbow cookies! I ordered the white albacore sandwich it was bisque!! Knish was prime with as much spicy brown mustard as I could eat. Also bottomless Arnold Palmers and kosher pickles."
1,"I know what I like and it does not often take me long to make up my mind on a menu, however I spent over 8 min decided and could have spent more.\n\nThe reason, so many tempting items, I usually just t need to decide between the fish or veggie dish, but here every dish is a veggie dish.\n\nWe started our meal with fake crab puffs and samosas.  The crab puffs were great, crispy garlicky and for having no cheese egg or crab lacked nothing. The plate of puffs came with a thimble of sweet dipping sauce, and there were 5 puffs for $3.\n The plate of 3 samaos for $4 were not as impressive, there was too much cumin giving it a cinnamon taste, the warper was crisp and not greasy.\n\nFor my meal I went with the Thai peanut mock beef with brown rice. $7.50 I was happy to have brown rice as a standard option. The bowl while small had fresh crisp veggies, the sauce was a bit weak but the mock beef was interesting in flavor and texture.\n\nIt is order at the counter and they bring it to you style, they have a stage   so it may not be a great for a intimate chat. there is some couch and patio seating.\n\nFor drinks there is fountain and new age soda options.\n\nIf you are a veggie or follow similar dietary restrictions (halal kosher vegan budist monk etc..) give this place a try"
1,My wife and I ate here this evening for our 15th anniversary.  The interior had changed drastically since our last visit in terms of decorations. The menu had also changed with some items doubling in price.  A coworker of my wife had given her a $25 gift card for Christmas.\nWe ordered sweet teas and a Bloomin onion. The onion had a definite spicy taste to the batter that reminded me of old bay seasoning.  My wife had the chicken tenders and I had the pork tenderloin.  It wa a good but wasn't outstanding. At one point during the meal a skinny white guy knelt next to our table. He didn't introduce himself. He asked about our meal and disappeared. I told the waiter about him. We were both too full to have dessert on this outing but the French toast bread pudding looked delicious.
0,I will never come here again.  This place is so terrible I'm not even going to waste my time writing anymore of a review.
0,"I made a reservation for my wife's girl friends, a table for 10 and I mentioned three of them are celebrating their bday, which they did not consider having candle for them.\nI took my wife myself an hour earlier to have a glass of wine with her.\nThe first problem was that I  couldn't find the building entrance and no one mentioned us it would be same entrance as Hyatt hotel. \nSecond of all no one mentioned anything about valet parking, which was not complimentary. It was $10 which with validation will be discount to $7.\nWe told the host we have a reservation in an hour, but for now we want to sit in the bar area and have a glass of wine. It took 10 minutes to be seated and have our wine list. I had a glass of wine and left the restaurant. I hand my ticket to valet and he asked for $7 and I told him I thought the valet was comp and he said he wish.\nI hand him $10 and he asked me\"" should I keep the change\"" which I didn't mind, but I thought it was unprofessional. And then he ask on of his guy and they bring my car and of course I know that I have to tip him.\n In the other hand my wife and her friends are getting to get her and being seated on the table which 5 of them sit face to wall, which was not what we were told. They said they have 360* view.\nTheir food was ok, nothing to brag about.\nAnd at the end, they charge my wife's credit card about $750 instead $90 .\nI noticed it couple days after when I was checking my credit card online. \nThey had couple other mistake that they charged them more than they should.\nI called and I talked to a manager name Chris and he act so cool,like it is not a big deal and he tells me when you stop by next time I buy you a couple drink. I  told him this is not a way to talk to customer while you had a huge mistake in your business and services. I hope Roco come to himself and have some adult running his business.\nThank you"
0,"Here is my update: I just received this incredible message from the \""counter-helper girl\"".... After all this time, she sends this. Bitter much? \n\nGofuck Y.\nBlock User\n\nOne minute ago\n\""I am said 'counter helper girl' in one of your postings.  I was not trying to be snide or snotty, but simply help you with ordering for your next visit because I know how our food comes, always loaded with sauce.  But thank goodness, you most likely won't be returning.  And since you know so much about food and restaurants, I would think you'd know that the hour you came in at, is generally the slow part of the day in ANY RESTAURANT YOU VISIT.  I actually really do apologize that I came off snotty and snide, and that I was not prompt with your order, but you could have just been sincerely upfront and honest about your meal and I would have given you a free meal or two.  Instead of acting like a pretentious jerk to me while your fat girlfriend with fake hair threw daggers at me with her eyes and spending so much time blasting me on the internet.  And I'm sorry, how on earth could a 'counter helper girl' be at all pretentious by any means...  You were just rude, and it was unnecessary.\"" \n\nLet's address, shall we? This email shows that you're a nasty, bitter, insecure bitch. Check. We most likely WILL be returning, but only to show your boss, and the owners this lovely email. Check. You have no idea how much I know about food & restaurants, because you don't know me, but run some quick math. I'm 35. I started working in the restaurant industry at 14. That's 21 years. Probably longer than you've been alive, girly. \n\nBeen sincerely upfront? When? While you were talking shit with your co-worker? Right. I'll get right on it. \n\nNeed I even address the \""fat\"" comment? She's 6 feet tall and an athlete. Sorry she doesn't look in the mirror in disgust and need to go vomit herself into a positive self-image. Fake hair? Jealous much? It's real. As are her tits. That you need to talk about her physical looks to make a point about your shitty service reflects much about the way that you see yourself. Let me guess; you think you're fat, and hate what you see when you look in the mirror. She does not. Check.\n\nAs far as those little daggers that you felt... It's because you suck at doing your job. You're there to work, not socialize with your besties. I watched as my food sat in the window for minutes with nobody paying any attention to it, to the tune of me needing to physically get up out of my seat to bring it to your attention. THAT is unacceptable service. It's shocking to us that there could literally be 3-5 people in the restaurant and food still sat in the window for a prolonged period of time. Again, unsat and unacceptable. Serving food that you admittedly say is loaded with sauce is \""your thing\"", but to remake it exactly the same way shows a lack of attention to the customer.  \n\nEnjoy your job while you still have it, and I'll be seeing you soon. Check and checkmate.\n\n**I want to offer my sincere THANK YOU for validating everything that I stated in my review of you, and the restaurant.**"
1,"It was busy, but we were greeted\n and seated promptly. Our server was prompt and friendly. My wife ordered the CB sampler with dumplings, meat loaf, and ham. I ordered the country fryed stake. All the food was good except the meat loaf that was bland."
1,MMMMmmmm.
0,"I will never set foot in this store ever again after today.  About three weeks ago I brought my bike to them after a friend suggested the store to fix a warped chain that was extremely annoying.  Upon inspection from the guys, the gears were also wearing very poorly because of the warped chain, so they suggested to replace those too.  I figured why not, might as well get the whole assembly fixed up nice.  They needed to order one part, which would take about a week.  The following Thursday I get a phone call that the part was in and I immediately brought my bike to the shop for them to fix and I left it with them.  Before I left, I asked about how long they thought it would take to fix it.  I was told they would try to get to it on Friday, and if not I'd have it early next week.\n\nGreat!  I'm all excited, it's just gonna suck to have to walk everywhere for a few days, but it'll be worth it.  So 4th of July weekend comes and goes, didn't get my bike on Friday, (Monday was the 4th) Tuesday, or Wednesday.  So on Thursday, I call and they tell me that they've been very busy and backed up and shorthanded and they didn't come in over the holiday weekend to work.  He can't give me an exact update other than there are only 3 bikes ahead of mine.  No call Thursday.  On Friday I call again.  It's now a week after they told me I should expect my bike.  They inform me that they should be getting to it that day.  Low and behold, late afternoon I get a phone call that it's ready.  At 5 after work, I go and pick it up.  I pay them and I ride home without a problem.  \n\nYesterday, I rode to work without a problem.  When I went home last night, the gears started skipping.  I wasn't having this problem before they fixed the bike though, so I was very confused.  This morning, I'm on my way to work, just pulling out of my street onto Neglley and the gears skipped in the middle of the road.  I also got hit!!  Scared the hell out of me.  A normal 10 minute bike ride took close to 20 minutes because I couldn't get proper power out of my bike.\n\nToday at 11, when the shop opened, I was their first customer.  I brought the bike in and the tech took a look at the chain and said one of the links was busted.  The chain is 4 days old.  So he fixed it free of charge by just replacing the broken link.  Either way, I don't like the fact that a chain broke so easily.  I paid over $120 for them to keep my bike for a week and for me to have to go back a few days later because something they replaced had already broke.\n\nLike I said at the top, I'll never go back..."
0,"This used to be a hidden gem at the Plaza on the end of Fremont Street.  Has turned into a train wreck.  What once was a bustling restaurant, with capable wait staff, has turned into something that is beyond description.  No longer do waitresses serve you but you must go up to the counter and order.  Gone are the waitresses and experienced sushi chefs, gone are the specialty fish that used to be for sale.  Glass cases are empty, non-asian sushi chefs are behind the sushi bar, and it was deserted.  I hope the new management is happy.  We used to go AT LEAST once a month, and always took our visitors there - but no longer.  Our group of 5 walked in on July 5th, saw the changes and left.  Congrats to the management for taking a wonderful place and killing it."
1,Great environments! Only downside is service is a bit slow !
1,"I highly recommend Chad.  He is friendly, knowledgeable, and listens to his clients to ensure he treats problem areas effectively."
1,"Very good Chinese food! \nespecially the Beijing Duck , So delicious. Even Better than DaDong, the famous Beijing Duck restaurant in Beijing!\nThe service is great too. \na little bit pricy, but definitely worth!"
1,"Best Burritos and homemade salsa ever!  The restaurant is new and clean.  A pleasure to eat there and chat with the owners.  Our favorite meal during our entire week long trip to Arizona.  There was no visible sign on the building, so it was a little tricky to find.  Look for the street sign and sandwich board."
0,"I was excited to go there after seeing them on cupcake wars, and the cupcakes were great. However the service was horrible. The first time we went the young lady was rude and seemed annoyed that I asked her about the cakes from the show. The second time we went we arrived there at 540 and the window said it closed at 6 but the door was locked. When I called to ask them why they weren't open since it wasn't 6 yet he hung up on me."
0,"You know that little voice in your head that says not to go down that alley or drink that last drink? I was feeling that when booking for this show, but I thought, \""Hey, it's Michael's music, I can do that.\"" \n\nBoy, was I wrong.\n\nAny time that you are seeing an impersonator, you have to remind yourself that they will never be as good as the original. Good, maybe even mediocre, and most of the times just god awful. This falls into the category of sheer fuckery, almost comical, and a bit sad. \n\nIf you're playing Michael Jackson, you have to have the chops to not only sing, but dance as well. I felt that I was at a Happy Hour Karaoke, the dude's voice annoyed the heck out of me and he also forgot the lyrics most of the time! The mic went out at some times too. I found myself completely ignoring him and focusing my attention on the dancers and the musicians--that itself tells you it wasn't worth the price!!\n\nAs much as I was glad it was over, it was only an hour! Really?? I hated that the switching from song to song was so fast, it didn't give enough time to let the moment simmer, so to speak. It was like a game of how quickly I could get through the songs. SMH.\n\nThe audience seemed amused. Some people really go into it, so what do I know. The place is circular with seats, plus a bar that charges ridiculously for their drinks. Meh. \n\nDo yourself a favor, save your money and go see MJONE at Mandalay Bay."
1,Also went here today. Anybody who is interested in history or history of toys may want to pay a visit here.I quite enjoyed just a little nit more than the peoples story. Every picture here told a story.
0,I walked inn went to the counter to sign inn and no words from them they just looked I said hello to them I got a smile cracked. I got immediate service but after service was done I was unable to use the restroom. Good enough to received my money but not able to use restroom. I took it out on her tip which she didn't say thank you when receiving .
1,"Wow! What an awesome, wonderful, beautiful experience. She was so sweet and excited with us to see our baby moving. We watched out sweet baby move for a long time on a large flat screen tv in a tranquil room with relaxing music. She really loved people and babies and made the experience so special for us. She even wrote the gender down on an envelope for us and didn't even slip :) we saw so many cool things and didn't feel rushed at all. I would recommend My Sunshine Baby to anyone. We did this on a whim and I'm so glad we did!! Definitely going back with our next baby :)"
0,"Totally forgot to Yelp about the Star Trek Experience during my recent trip to Las Vegas.  \n\nMy friend and I, both Trek fans, decided to spend the day here.  We get there and made our entrance.  I do have to say that it was impressive.  You could spend hours reading everything in this cool museum filled with all these Star Trek artifacts.\n\nMe, I was snapping pictures on anything related to Star Trek: Voyager.  (The best of them all!  Na-na na-na boo-boo!)\n\nSo, if everything was great, why the 2 stars?  Well!  The rides were just not Deaf-friendly.  Most shows have scripts ready for Deaf people or at least, provide interpreters.  And those that don't provide any kind of accommodations, we'd either get a discount or get our money back.  My friend and I suffered through one of the shows (the Borg show), missing out on everything.  Although, the 3-D (or rather 4-D) stimulations were interesting.\n\nAfter the show and a look-through the gift shop, we headed back up the front to get our money back, even if it was partial.  Oh no, they wouldn't even dare think about refunding our money.  They were dead set on the non-refundable policy, regardless of what may come.  Even the manager wouldn't even consider our request.\n\nSo, that just left a bitter taste in our mouths of how these people at the Star Trek Experience were not understanding or even willing to listen to our experience.  Blah!\n\nFor fun, I suggest you check out the Cirque de Soliel shows..."
0,If I could put zero I would. I've been coming here since it opened and it has went down hill for sure. Drinks are half azs and service is just as bad. At least nights are terrible. \nIf you are looking for a place to play and get a drink I would recommend to look at other bars. The night shift bartender does not take care of the players but he does take care of his friends that hang out there. My drink taste fine but alittle warm for it being wine. I promise one thing as long as the bartender I had tonight is there we will not be going back. So many other choices in this town than a place that caters to bartenders friends and not people that can bring this place other paying customers!!
1,I usually go to square cafe on weekends and I love the outdoor seating and that dogs are welcome. My only complaint is that I wish there was a better wait system. The location makes it difficult to wait because of the size of the space. but not much can be done about that. Food is always excellent and the service has no room for complaints. Love it!
0,I knew I shouldn't have stopped.  All my other visits over the years had been terrible but I was really craving fried shimp and couldn't imagine how they could screw it up.  Well...$8 later after eating 3 flavorless greasy shrimp and picking at the fish I threw it away because I knew I was going to throw up if I ate any more.  It was THAT bad.  Where is the corporate or owner quality control on this product and to make it worse the cashier was an idiot lost in his own world - What's a combo...dah it's a number 9 with chicken.  OK what's a number 9?
1,"Oh my god amazing!\n\nSuch a great find in Vegas.  Delicious cheap food, there for you whenever you could possibly be hungry.\n\nThe tomato soup is incredible.\n\nI will be here often during all of my future Vegas trips."
1,This place is close to the house with convenient hours and is clean. I think we don't have the smallest unit but it's spacious. It costs about $75. The one complaint is they make you but insurance which is not disclosed in anything we read about before going there. It's $9 a month for 2k worth of insurance which sucks.
1,"This is a great environment once you get in. The line to pay and get seated can be quite long, especially if you come during brunch buffet hours. It's around $28 per person. \n\nThe buffet itself is pretty good. They have some great items and a few misses. Overall you will have very good food prepared carefully, which is a challenge at a buffet. Service for clearing plates from the table is very good. They have good ranging from sushi to pork belly to omelets to kale salad. I would say there are about 100 items in the buffet. \n \nMy favorites:\n1. Creamed corn\n2. Pumpkin pancake\n3. All the desserts \n4. Spaghetti with mushrooms\n5. Porkbelly"
0,"Get outta here! I took a look at the reviews bc their average was so high and couldn't believe it.  Let's bring it back down to earth a little bit, shall we?\n\nI ordered the chicken hibachi and it was a far cry from what chicken hibachi should be...  It made me contemplate the important questions in life:  How much should price factor into yelp* ratings?  Should I be more lenient bc it's a lunch spot while at work?  Answers to come..\n\nHow much should price factor into yelp* ratings?  Price should factor only into the quality of food, not quantity.  They give more food than you can eat, but the limiting factor is the quality.  \n\nVegetables - they come from the back kitchen where we don't see it getting made.  The vegetables have definitely been overcooked.  If you can pull a discernible texture from each veggie in there, props to you.  Carrots, zuchini, brocolli, bok choi, all tasted the same and had same texture.  I don't even know why it's in there - it hardly plays off the rice/protein.  Perhaps if the veggies still had a little crunch in them and weren't soggy and soaked for hours it would go well. I'm just saying.\n\nChicken/Rice - average but nothing spectacular.  Anytime chicken is cut into small pieces when it could be served in larger pieces, the protein is suspect.  \n\nWould I go here again? I don't think so.  Waiting for my food sucks too bc it's so close to the soda fountain.\n\ndmo out"
0,"I do not give 1 star reviews lightly, but this business is beyond unprofessional.  Their business practices seem to change with the mood of the owner, and it is the customers who suffer."
0,"This place would do a lot better if it didn't charge people parking to shop here. It's $12 if you don't validated your ticket, and even if you do they still charge you if your stay for 4 hours from when you first got there. Which doesn't make sense if your going to eat(2 hr), then see a movie (2hrs). Plus these parking rules are not stated up front. And if you want to speak to the parking manger( the night one is named Keith) he doesn't care and would give you any courtesy. He's rude and has very poor customer service skills. He bellittles you and tells you he has better thinks to do. As long as they have service like this, this place will always be a dump."
1,i had lunch with my wife. momo is exellemt. fish is very fresh and good quality. sashimi  and kiss of fire roll was so taste it. i strongly \nrecommended momo's. customer service is excellent!!
1,"The pancakes are spectacular!  I had the S'mores short stack pancakes and my husband ordered the bacon pancakes with a side order of hash browns.  The S'mores pancakes are light fluffy pancakes, with chococate, graham cracker pieces, marshmallows and topped with cool whip.  They give you syrup on the side but you really don't need it.  My husband thought the bacon pancakes could have used more bacon but still enjoyed his breakfast and the hash browns.\n\nThe staff was very friendly and our waiter was spectacular even with the restaurant being packed full of customers.  We had to wait about 20 minutes for a table but the wait is worth it."
1,"I ate so much here I hurt myself. I also forgot what I ordered (besides a few al pastor 'cos), so I can't really go into too much detail here, but what I do know is that what I had was pretty darn delicious. My bud and I grabbed 5 tacos, 4 special 'cos with extra toppings and two drinks, with our will coming out to around $20. There are some die-hards out there who refuse to pay more than $1 for a street taco, but I'm not that guy and think that 2 hungry (tipsy) dudes who can eat themselves sick for around $10 is a darn good deal. Parking is a b*tch here, but there's this amazing attendant who will walk you through squeezing in and out of a spot. If you're looking for some delicious cheap eats downtown, make the trip here! \n\nWarning: you might be mesmerized by the al pastor spit. Mmmm spit..."
1,1 Word: WOW. \n\nThis place was incredible. \n\nI have heard about this place a bunch of times but never had a chance to check it out. Finally went yesterday for lunch and I cannot wait to go back again. Make sure you have an appetite because these burgers are the real deal. \n\nI was starving and order the Parmesan fries an Kiki's burger- easily one of the best burgers I have ever had. \n\nEverything was perfect-so fresh. My friend ordered the spicy miso burger and that was delicious too!\n\nI will definitely be back and recommend this to friends.
0,"I checked this place out on a Saturday around 11pm thanks to Yelp. Its surrounded by about 5 other bars, which you may want to go to. Walked in with a friend, there was about 75 men and 8 ladies. We pretty much turned around and walked back out. You can get that ratio at any pub in Vegas. Dark, older, bench seats, it wasnt impressive at a glance."
0,"Don't waste your time and money.  This buffet was very pretty, but had no substance.  I was so excited to see all the pretty and nicely presented food, but when I started eating, it all went downhill.  Their two good items are the arugula salad and the banh mi sandwiches (very good, full of flavor and tasty).  My son (13) and I (both total foodies) went for the Friday late breakfast buffet and was not impressed.  So disappointed b/c we thought it would be good.\n\nThe service is mediocre, they serve prosecco (not champagne) and when I asked for a second glass of \""champagne\"", my server said that I had to pay.  I had expected to pay since only one glass is complimentary.  She then told me that they had unlimited \""champagne\"" for $8 which I said was fine.  She came back and said her manager told her they only offer that on weekends, so I would have to pay $9 for the glass.  I said that was ok.  She takes forever and then spills my champagne at another table and has to get a fresh one.  She finally returns with my glass of \""champagne\"" and says that it actually costs $10 per glass.  At this point, I asked her what \""champagne\"" they were serving and she said \""prosecca\"".  I informed her that I wanted to know the label b/c there was no way that this particular glass of \""prosecca\"" was worth $10 a glass.  She went back, got the name of the label for me (never heard of it) and then stated that the actual cost of the champagne was now $7 per glass.  She had mistakenly charged me for a champagne cocktail rather than straight champagne.  She then asked (albeit very nicely) that I had to pay the $7 now.  I was eating, so I asked if I could pay at the end of the meal.  She said that it was their policy to get paid for any \""extra\"" drinks right away.  At this point, we were done with our meal (didn't eat much), paid for the glass of prosecco (still half left) and left.\n\nIf you want an excellent buffet, check out the Sterling Brunch (Bally's) - it is hands down the best buffet in Vegas.  Also good are the Studio B buffet (at the M Resort) and the Wynn buffet."
0,"I came here on a Sunday night, nobody was there and I was actually his first customer. Hookah was overpriced for what it was and we paid before we even got the hookah. It was 30 dollars and you have to order at least one drink. He did tell us that we had to wait 10 minutes for the coals to warm up even though it took around 20 minutes. We smoked hookah for about 3 minutes before it got harsh and we had to practically hunt down the employee to fix it. Overall, it was a \""whatever\"" experience. Decor was beautiful and they do have a full bar. However, I won't be back. If you want good hookah and easy prices, you're better off going to Tempe."
0,"Horrible service, bad overpriced food, My wine took 40 minutes to arrive at the table and the waitress had forgotten what selection I ordered, 30 minutes for salad and 1 million excuses from the waitress ans to why everything had gone so horribly wrong but no apologies from her or the manager who also seemed completely disinterested and aloof.  I wanted to talk to the manager but we were running so late that I literally had no time to discuss our experience and once our food arrived we ate as quickly as possible to be out by 7pm which did not happen anyway.  I was charged $5 for sharing my $48 dinner with my 7 year old as she did not realize to order a $48 meal was still way more expensive than ordering the 6oz filet and a kids meal. I thought that was absurd of her especially since we ran up such a high bill and to boot the crab legs were inedible. Not one person at the table went beyond sampling them. They were super salty, rubbery as if cooked 20 times and they were cold as if they waited for the rest of the food to be ready.  Also once the food arrived our waitress pulled another disappearing act, she turned out to be very good at this. My husband got up on 3 occasions and flagged down other servers to assist us, I think that is very bad especially for a place that charges along the lines of  Flemming's, Morton's, etc. My steak was decent. Salads were nothing more than an afterthought and they wanted $5 extra to switch from the lame house salad that comes with the meal ( a plate of lettuce doused in dressing)  to a Cesar salad when a Ceasar is only $4 on the a la cart menu- that makes absolutely no sense!!!  I paid $53 for a bad plate of food and horrible service that made us late for our event. We had 90 minutes to get in and out which should have been plenty of time but we were there for 2 hours and that's only because we ate as fast as we could., the place was fairly empty when we arrived but we still ended up missing half of our event. The filet was good, not great but good, the potato was dry and the salad was like I said, very bland with no though into what went into it. If you want to be known as an excellent high quality establishment you need to BE an excellent high quality establishment."
1,Always something to do!
1,"My family ( husband, 3 kids under 12) came here from yelp recommendation.  First of all the service was absolutely amazing!   We got the guacamole and they make it table side! Food was very good. I got the shrimp enchiladas and they were very tasty.  I was already so full from the yummy soup and chips and dip that I had to take most of it to go!"
0,"Never in my life have I been ACCUSED of something when simply trying to pick up my to-go order! I walked in to retrieve my order of Pad Thai, to be confronted by a hostile, fire breathing woman asking me if I had written a negative review on the Internet because whoever did....placed an order similar to mine. I told her no, that it wasn't me...because surely there has to be another person on earth that has placed an order for meatless Pad Thai. She asked me again. I told her once more that it was not me. She then summoned an older women to the front where they exchanged foreign language shenanigans and at that moment, I no longer was ok with this bullying by little angry Thai women. It was also apparent that they had decided I was the guilty party before I even arrived, so I definitely was NOT ok with eating that (probably tampered with) food. I was a patron of this mediocre place because it was closer to me than Basil Thai...but from now on, I will drive further for better service and better food. And now....I definitely am writing a negative review and will shout it from the mountaintops that this place has horrible service with food that is extra average & should not be patronized!"
1,"I chanced into this place because it's almost across the street from La Shish Kabob. My last and only meal at Machu Pichu was so dismal that I never went back and I've been craving for Ceviche. \n\nThe location used to be a Thai restaurant, lots of wood and carved elephants, but the music is lively salsa and not played softly either. Business is very slow, Mily and Lalo (the owners) do the cooking and serving both. \n\nFirst we were served a complimentary basket of fried dough with some twists. The flour is made of Yuca and the Peruvian red salsa that served with it kicks arse!! Spicy but also packed with flavor -no relationship to Mexican salsa, none. I squeezed a few drops from a lime wedge on top of it to really get my taste buds jumping. We didn't want to stuff ourselves on dough but it could not be helped.\n\nThen the Ceviche arrived, mine mixed seafood, my companion's just fish. The marinade was truly excellent. The fish was as \""fresh\"" as it gets in Charlotte (the only unfrozen fish is the goldfish in the bowl) but the ceviche was so good that we not only ate it all, we scooped the sauce from the plate to sip it, that good. I could taste that it had just been prepared there and then. \n\nAt that point we were stuffed. This was followed by a Chaufa de mariscos (sea food and fried rice) and some salsa verde for us to compare. We tried some it was delish and couldn't settle on which sauce matched best - I said red , but I would have been happy either way.  Too much is too much we had it bagged to take it home.\n\nMily the wife/owner/server was super nice although we got there near closing time. We had two very large (10oz) glasses of a decent Australian Sauvignon blanc and we were charged only $3  per!\n\nI'll upload a picture of \""Causa Rellena\"" - mashed potatoes with spices and lime and filled  with chicken, excellent again, this was not a dish that I'd expect to find in a cheap joint. Those who shy from spicy foods would enjoy it too. \n\nIf you want to know what a Ceviche *should * taste like, try them before it's too late. Obviously there is more to Peruvian cuisine and much of it is quite delish. Be patient, since they prepare everything to order the food takes some time to arrive even if the place is slow.\n\nps they close at 9pm"
0,Came here to try the Chili Dip but I ordered the wrong one instead :(. Everything was too salty for my taste. Service was very attentive. \n\nNam Kao Tod - salty. need more acidy\n\nBeef soup - very good and flavorful but a little over season \n\nNorthern Curry - salty also. I had this curry better somewhere else.
1,"Being Italian, its hard to impress and compare too homemade cooking. However the meal here is outstanding!!!!!!!!!!   I would highly highly reccomend, service prefect, and a impeccable restroom.. Our dinner consisted of house salad, the homemaid Papperdale pasta with truffle, scallops and asparugus, a perfectly balanced flavor of all ingredients, followed by the Seabass, and the Tripe which were both tremendous, dishes clean. Like usual problem, no room for desert. The lounge area is very inviting, old school, and relaxing.  Not only will be returning, but cannot wait."
1,"I am a fairly loyal Harris Teeter shopper, but have rarely gone to this location, as I have several closer to me.  Finding myself near this Teeter today after a lunch at Libretto's (across the parking lot), I stopped in for a few items that were on sale. \n\nLocated at the Corner of Johnston/521 and Ballantyne Commons Pkwy, this is a large Harris Teeter without being HUGE.  Parking is ample for the grocery store and the surrounding stores.\n\nAs of this writing, in June of 2013, they are currently doing a remodel and are down to 1 set of doors at one end of the store.  The current layout of the store is the typical Teet floor plan, but the signage is a little more updated.  Aisles were well marked, VIC savings were plainly marked on the items I was looking for.  For a late Sunday afternoon, there were plenty of registers open.  The woman who checked me out was very pleasant and I was quickly on my way.\n\nClean store (even with the remodeling going on) in an easily accessed location."
1,"Don't let the fact that this place is inside the Paris Casino fool you.\n\nMy Friend Gabi, you were so delish.  Paris Casino has dropped from its prime, if it ever was on same level as the other major properties so you wouldn't expect the food at this place to be at such a high level.\n\nSince the wait was crazy long for outdoor seating, I opted for sitting inside which was fine because it reminded me of the autumn brunches and afternoons I had in Paris, very traditional decor inside with dark rich colors.  The tables here just like in Paris are crammed together.  The service was great, I had the plate du jour, which was a Meatloaf Sandwich, this is a classic French Bistro so the bread they give you was incredible enough, and the bread for the sandwich did not disappoint either.  The meat in the sandwich was yummy, but it was rather petite, the fries that accompanied the sandwich was a disappoint though.  They were crispy but too thin for me, and this is a French bistro so why are you offering me ketchup?  I had to ask for mayo, and out comes this big-ass gravy boat of mayo, they didn't have any small sauces cups or something.  Besides the size the mayo tasted like homemade, French people love mayo to the point that they will make their own, and this is not home-made.\n\nOh I had a drink which was okay too, really decent price, good joint, MAKE RESERVATIONS (online or phone), sit outside unless it is sweltering and enjoy."
1,The Vig is awesome. Perfect place to go with friends or coworkers after a long day at the office to have a glass of wine off and enjoy either an appetizer or my favorite Steak Salad. Also a great place for people watching since you get an eclectic mix of the Scottsdale/Phoenix scene.
0,"VERY DISAPPOINTED.  I was given a 2 for 1 coupon, and tried the buffet on Tuesday evening Feb, 25th.  $17 for a quite buffet seemed OK, until perusing the food on display, I was over come with \""Sticker Shock\"".\n\nThe buffet appeared to be half full, with a few families, and but most of the senior citizens knew each other.  Our waitress was efficient, polite and did not forget us, as most buffet rooms are understaffed making it impossible for all but seasoned staff able to cope.  \n\nThe Prime beef was melt in your mouth, the Pork was not dry, and also melt in your mouth.  Marble tofu, had no pork (sad), to many vegetables, but the sauce had good consistency, instead of tofu in water debacle served in Boulder Station. The remainder of the Asian food looked like it had been setting in the trays since noon. Since I was there for dinner, I tried one, spring roll and in my opinion they need to hire a Asian food cook.\n\nSpaghetti noodles were floating in water, and completely mush, sauce had a good flavor, but could not finish it with the overcooked spaghetti noodles.  Maybe if I had no teeth.   The milky fluid and water socked corn was passed quickly.  \n\nSalad, venue was far better, crisp and kinda appetizing compared to the cooked food, but I was quite disappoint, I could have visited any McDonald down the street & around the corner for a better prepared meal, with two exceptions: The Beef was amazing, and one \""No Added Sugar\"" hard Ice Cream, with a Chocolate flavor that was wonderful.  \n\nUnless you are possessed and mad, this is a buffet to avoid, unless you live next door, and have lost your teeth along with the sense of smell, and taste.  Or you do not enjoy eating, and are very angry at the long lines and understaffed buffets of other Casinos."
1,Loved the food and I cannot believe how flavorful their olive oil is! I bought the roasted garlic one and it is amazing. We also bought the bleu cheese stuffed olives and my husband ate the whole jar in two days. My only negative and why I didn't give 5 stars is because it is kinda unorganized. We didn't know where we were supposed to go or what we were supposed to do to eat. But I will go back!
1,Great atmosphere tucked away in the South Side. Coffee is pretty good. Would definitely go back.
0,Ok so I have been here a time or two. Each time my wife and I say ugh we need to remember not to come back here. The first time we came we thought it was awesome and were super excited to have a great place near by. Well if I remember we were drinking that night and have been disappointed EVERY time after that. Tonight our service was great but food not so much. I think we will finally throw in the towel on Spinatos. I say good day...
1,"This is the ONLY service that I have had a great experience with since moving to Vegas four months ago. Roy the plumber is awesome. I've used him twice. Soooo nice and he goes above and beyond.\nUpdate-\nSo now my air conditioning decided the day it was 102 degrees to stop working.  Jeremy came to the rescue and now my house is polar again. I had called after hours (someone is always there as they answer 24/7) and he said first appt. was Friday. This was Tuesday, so I cried like a 40 year old baby and they fit me in the very next day. THANK GOD.  This company is the best. I wish they did more things!"
0,"I am surprised by all of these great reviews.  People comparing this place to bagels from New York.  No comparison whatsoever!  They lack any kind of flavor and the flavored cream cheeses barely contain anything to flavor them - very skimpy.  Great neighborhood atmosphere and I really wanted to love this place, but sadly will not return."
0,"It was faster than a Filibertos. Which means, their stuff is probably all frozen and just deep-fried before serving. \n\nI've been here for lunch a couple times and its OK at best. I mean, cheap, fast, Mexican food and its close by. Chips and salsa are okay. I usually order off  their lunch menu and went with a lunch-sized chimi. \n\nOur food came out so fast. I think it took us 20 minutes to have lunch since the food came out so quick. I cut open my chimi and noticed a lot more \""juice\"" in it than normal and when forked some of the shredded beef out of the chimi to have a taste, it was kind of gamey. \n\nI've had better experiences here but today's lunch made me gag and I never do that! =)"
0,We were excited to try this place as we have been hearing alot about it.  Lee's smells like a hospital and it's a bit of a turn-off to the appetite.  We tried to get past it and try a sample...the girl gave us barely a speck of ice cream and the bit we got tasted stale and freezer burned.  The girl kept saying you want some ice cream with alcohol? Come on we are adults it's not some big deal to get alcohol...ugh we left ...I give the place only a few months:(
0,Fired my pet from services but did it in a unprofessional and confrontational way that hurt my feelings.
0,I have not been super impressed lately with service.  One deposit at the window - now takes 10 minutes.  When the last bank manager was there - it was NOT this way.  They have not hired appropriate personnel.
1,"I was pleasantly surprised when I walked into the Vogue Bistro last night. I was expecting something cookie cutter, but this place definitely was not. The Vogue burger was delicious. My husband and I brought out of town guests and they thoroughly enjoyed themselves. Great atmosphere and martini selection. Will be back for sure!"
1,Great white pizza! A huge slice of pizza that really hit the spot. The workers were very sweet and helpful. \n\nMy only two complaints were that the Parmesan cheese in the shakers was not very fresh and there was also a napkin shortage.
0,"I was disappointed with my visit this past Saturday. I'm generally a huge fan of Fox Restaurants, but this one fell short. \n\nWe made a reservation for about 13 people and ended up waiting almost 30-45min past our scheduled reservation time to be seated. \n\nOnce we were finally seated, then came the ordering. With me being on such a strict diet, I was a bit skeptical about finding anything on the menu. I ended up ordering the Blanco Chopped Salad. which on the menu is described as \""Grilled Chicken, Seasonal Fruits, Pepitas (pumpkin seeds)\"" for $9. Sounds tastey right? Well before ordering it, I did ask the server if the 'salad' had lettuce in it, and he assured me it was lush mixed greens with mixed fruit, chicken, pepitas and a cilantro lime dressing. \""Perfect!\"" Well that's not what I got.\n\nApparently mixed seasonal fruits meant just apples and there was tomatos chopped up in it. Now understand, tomatos are considered a fruit, but when you read seasonal fruits, a tomato is the last thing on my mind. They were totally reaching there. And when I read fruits, I'm assuming more than 2. FAIL.\n\nNeedless to say, I came in with no expecations and walked away completely disappointed. \n\nI usually try and make one more attempt to go back to make a confirmed judgement, but this first visit literally left a bad taste in my mouth. I won't be going back."
1,Love this place. Love when I go here and they bring your food and drinks out to you! Nobody does that at a coffee shop. And although the guy didn't remember my order. He made a real effort to try to remember and that's something I like. \nI'd recommend you check them out!!
1,"Harvest is an excellent restaurant on the main square in downtown Madison. Their food incorporates local seasonal ingredients. I had a special salad of local heirloom tomatoes with a soft cheese (forgot the name), small leaves of basil and sea salt. Some of the best tomatoes I've had in years. I selected the home-made cavatelli pasta - made with pesto. sliced baby potatoes and green beans. Very good - and finished with a passion fruit sorbet. Highly recommended!"
1,Love their twice baked patatoes
0,"I was dying for some drunken noodles, saw this place close and gave it a go.  They open at 11, I tried 1058, no one there realized how early and killed time at the dollar store, came back at 1114, still not open, started to leave and someone ran to the door to unlock it, still had her purse on so I know she just walked in the door.  I ordered takeout drunken noodles and asked how long it might be since I know they just walked in, 5 min.  I didn't know whether to be happy or scared.  How could that be ready in 5 min? It was obvious they took old stuff and just re fried it, pretty greasy and nothing tasted fresh.  I am not one to know authenticity, but I had some drunken noodles in San Diego that I am trying to find something similar here.  This is my 3rd round with the noodles and just a few other times eating Thai apart from that, but this was my worst for sure out of all of them.  I don't know Thai food real well, but I know fresh, and I didn't get anything fresh here.  Also, smelled like old lady moth balls"
1,"Outlet shopping is definitely up there on the top reasons to go to Vegas and this outlet certainly doesn't disappoint!! I've been going to Vegas for years and years and was super excited when this new outlet came about and even more excited when they expanded!  They've got a variety of stores from the classic Coach outlet to Banana, French Connection, Children's Place, Guess, etc to LeSport Sac, Juicy, and D&B.  The fact that it's outdoors is good and bad, sometimes weather makes it a little difficult to shop (too hot in the summer, too cold in the winter).  I love the addition of the parking structure, though I think it seems like a far walk from the structure to the stores - but I'm all for more parking! Another great thing about the place is that on Black Friday, it seems that they keep opening earlier and earlier for serious shopper like myself!!\n\nI do think that they need to improve on their Food Court - there really isn't anything about it that stands out, but at least they have a Starbucks!!"
0,"I have been to Timo a few times and always enjoyed it.  However, this last time I went the bartender was very rude. I didn't know the hours were different than what was posted on the website.  We came in and just wanted drinks and we were told that would be fine.  Then we were rushed because the bartender wanted to go home. Our server was very nice. The bartender came over to us and started to take our bottle of wine and informed us \""it was time to go\"". I have never been so rushed out of somewhere while finishing a drink. Very rude and have just lost customers because of this. Too bad because I did like this place."
1,Galleria Mall is convenient for me. They have all the stores I like. Its easy to get in and out. You can park near the store you need to go to and enter and exist from the store. I usually park at Macy's I go in get what I need and get out. Its fast and you don't have to walk the entire mall just to visit one store.
1,Good food at a decent price. Only problem when I come here is it seems I am the only customer so not much on ambiance or social scene.
1,"Service is ridiculously fast.  Power outlets under many of the booth chairs.  Free ad supported Boingo Internet.  Good selections for Vegetarians - including veggie burger option!   I found this place during a long wait for a flight back home and basically camped out here waiting for my flight.  The veggie burger was delicious as were the brews and the wait staff was very attentive and didn't rush me out or make me feel bad while I was sitting there nursing my beer while wiating for my flight.\n\nI'd highly recommend to anyone flying through Phoenix who is hungry, wants to relax and has a little time so spare."
1,"Wings cooked perfectly. Buffalo sauce is great and equally as good is the blue cheese dressing. Coleslaw was a 7 out of 10 and the fries an 8 out of 10. Fairly quick, orders out in 10 minutes. Only complaint and i think im just getting old, but i cant stand when a eatery blasts adult contemporary music while you eat. Back ground music is fine but when you have to raise your voice to talk its too much. It is probably good for table turnover though because i ate and ran the hell out. I cant get the coldplay out of head. Ahhhh"
0,"The place looks nice since the renovation with a nice outdoor seating area and sleek interior, but it does not justify the overpriced groceries that can be found in almost every other grocery store in the area for less."
0,"This was my first time experiencing a brazilian steakhouse. Unfortunately, I was not blown away. While walking up to the entrance, I noticed the greeter passing out coupons to people passing by. When we came up, she asked us if we had reservations. We did. She tried to discreetly hide the coupons and led us to the table. When I inquired about the coupons, she acted very annoyed and was hesitant to hand one over. So what? Just because we already had plans to eat here meant we weren't allowed to get a discount? I did not like her attitude at all. \n\nThe waiter was decent, but was not especially helpful. He did what was required, explaining the menu and keeping our water glasses filled. \n\nWe were able to go to their buffet for side dishes, and the meat dishes were brought to the table. The side dishes weren't impressive and they were very slow in bringing the meat rodizio around. There were only two guys walking around at a time, then they would disappear, and it was quite a wait in between until they came out with new meat entrees. The food was ok but nothing spectacular, also a little on the salty side. \n\nMy boyfriend ordered the meat rodizio while I ordered the seafood rodizio. They brought out a tiny dish with 3 scallops the size of nickels!!!!!!! The salmon and cod were the size of half a deck of cards each, and 3 shrimps on a skewer. I had to order at least 3 orders. I understand that maybe the Gulf oil spill may be limiting seafood choices, but scallops as small as nickels???? For $45??? That was pathetic.\n\nI was ok with a nice dinner in Vegas and we spent what I expected to spend. But I probably wouldn't return to this specific brazilian steakhouse. I might try ones with better ratings. If anything, maybe one that has nicer people."
1,"I LOATHE the slumburbs, but get out of my downtown Las Vegas bubble to keep friends. I met a buddy here for breakfast a couple of weeks ago and was really surprised. Very nice interior, not corny looking 80's style country ducks and crap of my childhood. The food and service were dang great. Wish they had a place closer or I would have given it 5 stars. I rarely drive so far, but I might again for this place!"
0,this place is shitty they tell you they deliver 2.5 miles and dont horrible customer service and i really hope this place shuts down apperently my money no good there dont even bother with this place its a waste og time
1,"Salvatore's is HERE IN MADISON! Woohoo, the Yelp favorite pizza is here!! Let's cheer! No more driving to Sun Prairie for Salvatores!\n\nI was surprised by the size of Salvatore's, maybe 8 tables or so, and the bar area is small. So, I was really thankful to visit on a weekday, when I didn't need to wait for seats, and food didn't take too long to arrive. If you're lost, it's right next to Johnson Public House, and have pizza board with skulls saying Wisco on them (So hipster :p)!\n\nThe menu has great selections - lots of appetizers, make your own pizza, specialty pizza and tacos!!! Pretty excited about all these things. Also, there's a good selection of beer and non-alcoholic drinks. \n\nI loved the carbonara pizza - eggs, bacon, cheese. my FAVORITE THINGS. AND, how is it possible that ALL 3 eggs were RUNNY. Such an amazing creamy, rich flavor with runny yolks! The crust of the pizza is thin crust, though not italian thin, but has great chew to it. (P.S. the ~8\""/$14 pizza was so big, we had some leftovers; the leftovers were AMAZING. just heat them up in the oven. oooohhhhh good)\n\nWe also tried the bacon and cheese bread (even though it was similar to our pizza..), the sriracha sauce added some much flavor and depth! LOVE IT. \n\nDefinitely gonna be visiting very soon again! How about some delivery very soon??? Please? :D"
0,They are open 24hours that's about all they have going for them. The prices are outrageous and they nickel and dime you for everything.  To use the credit card there is a 75cents charge. A half of pint of Malibu Rum was 17.99!!! Outrageous!
0,"I usually like it here, but for the second time in a row now there was hair in my food. Not just one little tiny hair, but a long hair. I called to complain they weren't that apologetic. Disappointed and disgusted."
0,This place just refused service. I have come here many times before! This time I had a hang nail that had bled but I informed them that it had not bled for 24 hours and that I have been keeping it properly cleaned for sanitation sake. They refused to fix the nail claiming that it was still bleeding. I told them that it had not been for a day but they argued with me saying that it would burn. I told them I have experiences far worse and that pain was not an issue. They made me wait 20 minutes and then refused service. I will NOT be coming back!!
0,"Casino only. \n\nWhy is it that in Vegas, small sleazy places are fun, but massive sleazy places are just gross? I don't know what it is with Excalibur -- maybe it was the drunk dude barfing into the garbage can in the middle of the casino. Yes, bad timing perhaps."
1,The revamped peanut butter pie is amazing !!
0,"NO NO NO. First off, we did not stay here because we wanted to. My husband and I are both active duty and we were staying in base lodging, but had to move here when there was no longer availability for us on base (were waiting to close on a house). When we called to make reservations, the women who we spoke to was pleasant enough. She had told us that there were utensils and other things provided for the kitchenette. We walked in and i swear i wanted to turn right back around. It reminded me of an 80s massacre movie/porn film. The \""kitchenette\"" had a butter knife, 2 forks and 2 spoons and a few glasses. We went down to the front desk and they said they'd try to get something for us and we had a few pots delivered the next day. Needless to say we ended up buying a cutting board, some knives and other essentials for cooking a meal. Our refrigerator was broken and didn't work, luckily they came out and swapped it that same day. We also wanted them to check on our AC because i swear that thing is possessed. They came to \""look\"" at it but said there was nothing they can do unless it stops working. It wakes us up every few hours with groans and pounding noises and screeches. Its not fun at all. The towels are a joke, if you want to call them towels. On the plus, the internet is pretty fast though. we were stuck with a room of 2 double beds. We thought one of the mattresses smelled of urine but nope, come to find out, there is an amazingly strong odor of urine just under the bed on the carpet! Yay! it smells so bad. The other double bed wasn't as bad..we only found one bug crawling in it so far. UGH! This place is not worth the money even with the sorry excuse for a military discount. I was considering moving into my coworkers RV instead of living here, but we are so tired of moving all our stuff around. Oh yeah- and the housekeeping only comes once a week- if you want it more often it costs extra..i think they said $40. NOT WORTH IT! Do not stay here if you have kids you care about or don't want to witness drug possession. On our way to and from the pool there is a lovely couple of people sitting at their couches rolling/smoking blunts in there with the door open. i wish i could not give any stars. The people at the front desk are so rude as well."
0,"Over served a belligerent customer at the bar who fell over in his bar stool hitting our table and spilling wine all over us.  Manager told us the patron was \""done\"" instead he got the guy another drink.  Meanwhile our bottle of wine was wasted and shirt was ruined.   Service of the year award..."
1,"Killer, killer, killer food!!! I have never eaten here and left without thinking, \""wow, that was good!\"" Not only is the the food exceptional, but the staff and drinks are equally as good. I run my own restaurant in the 18b, and can't wait to hang out here! Do yourself a favor and eat, drink, and feel sexy at Mingo's! Btw there is an actual Mingo and he is beyond cool. Love this place!"
0,"The WORST pool service ever!!\nThis company charged us ridiculous amount of money just to clean our pool.\nWe are first home buyer so we didn't have any idea about the pool and we wanted some advise from the pool service company. However, this company purposely closed our valve (other pool guys told us about this), so we wouldn't be able to clean our pool by ourselves. I can't believe that someone is doing business like this especially to local people. Do not use this service! Overpriced! Not helpful at all. Do not waste your money!"
0,Wow.  Unless you don't care about money don't even think about this restaurant.\n\n7 adults (one who had only a salad and one NA beer) were handed a $1300 bill.\n\nTurns out they weight the seafood frozen (apparently with a thumb on the scale too).  They claim that 6 of us ate over 12 pounds of seafood plus one steak (more on that in a minute) with ONE side dish between us and a couple appetizers and one desert.  There is NO WAY.\n\nThe steak was $60 and they offer no (as in ZERO) sauces or anything else to go with it.  It's a piece of meat on a plate for $60.  enjoy!\n\nIf you want to get ripped off you've found your restaurant.\n\nThat being said the food was good (not great) and certainly not $215 PER PERSON.
0,Got the Bun thit noung (sp?). Very bland.\nFriend got the lemon grass chicken - Could barely taste the lemon grass. It was just loaded with chili flakes and pretty much tasted like pepper.\nOther friend got the pho. She loves pho and pretty much eats any of them but wouldn't finish this one cause it was so bland.
1,"Cowaaaaaaaaaaaabunga!\n\nMe:  Can I spin? \nStaff: No.\nMe:  Can I run and leap off?\nStaff: No. \nMe:  Can you at least push me with all your might?  \nStaff:  Okay.\nMe:  woohoo! \nHe only touched my back.  Argh.\n\nDespite being denied all my requests, I still enjoyed the ride.  \n\n1.  Light as a Feather. Light as a feather.\nAs soon as you enter you will get weighed for the world to see.  At least it's not posted up.  When I went skydiving they posted your weight along side your name.  \n\nThe maximum weight is 250 lbs.\nThe minimum is 60lbs.\n\nMy 8 year old wanted to go but he was too light.  \n\n2.  Bring an ID.  \nEven though your showing Grey hairs you ain't gonna get the pass and go without your ID\n.  Shouldn't you have it all times in Vegas?  They'll let you gamble but once you hit that jack pot.  They ask for your ID in order to walk out with your winnings.\n\n3.  Sign your life away here ______.\nYou have to fill out the paper work and pay before you go up.  For skydiving you pay when you set foot on ground. \n\n4.  Leave your belongings.\nIf someone in your group is going to be a spectator on the bottom.  Give them your things.  They provide a small bag to carry your things.  The lightest person in your group gets the bag.  \n-no sunglasses - no cameras- no phones - nothing in your hands - even your flip flops must go in the bag\n\nThey allow you to use your own camera or phone to take pictures while your in line.  But you have to put away all loose objects once you hit the zip line.  \n\n5.  Let's get personal.\nThey strap you on to a harness. I saw a handful of girls with dresses and skirts but they had that who cares were in Vegas mentality.  Boys, they get close to your swimmers of life.  \n\n6.  Say Cheese : D\nThere are photographers to take pictures near the end.  Ask the staff where there located, so your picture ready.  \n\nGo with a group so you can relive the experience.  I went with my dad and my husband. If you know someone scared of heights persuade them to go.  Their jitters makes it more thrilling for you. Another person in line was pacing back and forth and spewing out profanities to his friend for getting him up there. \n\n I had the Las Vegas Power Pass, this came with the deal.   The catch for the pass is that you can only ride before 6pm.  I watched people zoom across at night and it definitely seemed cooler.  We were quoted 30 minutes and we waited around that time.  I'm sure at night it's much longer.  \n\nCost:\n$15 before 6 pm\n $20 after 6 pm\nGo again same day for $5\n\nTo me this is worth the try.  But if your a lone ranger, the wait may be too long, and the thrill too short lived."
0,"came here after dinner with some friends. \n\nmain issue is:\n\ni think the owner (an asian dude) was wearing crocs without socks while making and serving food.\n\n\n\nthe portions were generous, my blizzard was overflowing. awesome. but then while we were eating we all got this whiff of ASS. i looked at my friends and they looked at me like \""did you do it?\"" finally we looked over at the only other people who were an old couple a few tables away from us and they looked over at us like \""do you smell that?\"" finally we all started laughing and said it must be their sewer pipe or something. we already finished our stuff but overheard the wife of the elderly couple say \""ugh... how can you eat that with that smell?\"" hahaha we all got up and left. everyone was laughing while we walked out the door."
0,"Very disappointing.  My mom was having surgery at Meriter Hospital (a hop skip  & jump away from Chole's) and I called the day before to arrange an afternoon delivery.  (She checked in day of surgery.)  Even though I specifically requested and afternoon or early evening delivery, they called me at 10:30am and said there was no listing of her at Meriter.  I explained she was just checking in, and they guy told me \""no problem - we can deliver later\"" but sadly nothing had been delivered by 5pm.  When I called to follow-up,  was told that they had already been delivered.  I called a THIRD time around 7pm when I had been told they never arrived to reach a phone bank far away from Madison who had no idea what the status was...  \n\nThe following morning I called (a fourth time) to be told they would go out today, no apology.  The long and the short of it is that my mother did not receive her bouquet after coming out of surgery, and no one seems to care.  Horrible customer service.  I specifically used Chole's as I wanted to go with a local florist, and know they have been in Madison for decades, but I guess better to go with a 1-800-Flowers florist in the future?  Sad."
0,"I wish this place were better! The only redeeming factor about this place is the happy hour. I went here yesterday just after the lunch hour and the service and food were both below average. Don't get me wrong, the hostesses were nice... when they were actually around.\n\nI had the veggie burger and my friend had the beef brisket with bourbon sauce. Generally I find that if the veggie burger is good, the normal is bad and vise versa. However, both were terrible. My veggie burger had a terrible mush consistency and the quality of the bun was awful. My friends burger was also lackluster and flavorless. \n\nFor the price I would expect better food... much better food. \n\nHonestly, they should get rid of the tables and add more beer taps. Quit the food, up the drinks."

0,"If I could give this place no stars I would, not based on the ladies in the front or the nurse who helped me.  This rating is completely for Dr. Shi.  She was not very friendly and as soon as she walked into my appointment for my 13-month old with a laptop, I knew this was going to go down hill quickly.  She asked the questions from her laptop and clicked away on the keyboard, fine, whatever, than comes to weight and height chart for my 13-month old.  Dr. Shi asks how many bottles is she eating? What does she eat? Blah blah blah.  She proceeds to tell me \""Your baby is obese.\""  Really? A baby is obese?  Granted my baby is a chunk of love, but she's happy, healthy, growing and thriving, no need for labeling my chunk of love as obese.  I thought it was COMPLETELY uncalled for to say \""Your baby is obese.\""  Her bedside manners are um what's the word?? HORRIBLE.  Maybe she should practice being kind when working with babies, children and adolescents.  Perhaps saying, \""Oh, I can see she likes to eat, let's try cutting back on a bottle or two.\""  or maybe \""We might want to watch her weight at the next appointment.\""  Instead she said my baby is obese.  Avoid Dr. Shi unless you want your child to be labeled or have her point out all of the things your child is not doing, she's your doctor!"
1,"My husband and I love to brunch at Rachel's Kitchen on the weekends. Not only did they expand and have tons of seating now, but they also have an awesome outdoor seating area and live music on the weekends. It is a great little hang out place in the spring and fall when the weather is perfect. Now, on to the important stuff...\n\nThe blueberry pancakes are my personal favorite and they come with a side of fresh fruit. My current addiction is the Wilshire smoothie. Their smoothies are a bit runnier and more juice-like than other places, but they are still super tasty. They also have a great regular breakfast of eggs, toast, potatoes, and bacon. The potatoes seem to be oven roasted and aren't greasy at all. That's the thing I really love about Rachel's kitchen, everything is done with your health in mind. I have only had lunch here once and my sandwich was nothing special. The onion rings were delicious, but there were only about 3 or 4 of them, which was disappointing. \n\nThis is a great place to relax and enjoy a meal that you won't feel guilty about later, so go grab a seat on the plaza and be serenaded while eating some delicious food!"
1,"Great price for what you get. Everything is clean, the rooms are a little stuffy, but running the air conditioner it helps immensely. The people and customer service are awesome!!!! We were only here a day and most of the staff knew us by name. We decided to stay for Super Bowl because not only are the rooms a great price, but the food and drink too!! 6.99 for a decent prime rib dinner, 3.00 for drinks, and 3.00 blackjack. Will definitely come back."
0,"Alchemy N' Ale could be a great restaurant. The space is nice, the menu is full of hearty food that will appeal to most Pittsburghers (pork belly, interesting burgers, fried chicken dinners, and Shepard's pie), and they have great beers in bottles and on tap. \n\nRight now, however, they're still working out the mechanics. It seems like the owner is trying to run a restaurant by staffing it with friendly people who haven't had a lot of experience in the food industry. The bartenders had to look up how to make an Old Fashioned and a Manhattan. Our waitress brought out a huge cheese plate with four pieces of bread (and cheeses she couldn't identify). Then she dropped off a stack of dishes, pile of silverware, and paper towels for us to pass around the table. She didn't know which wines they had. Half of our party's food was cold because the kitchen didn't time out the prep so they would all be done at once. \n\nThis would all be normal if you were BBQ'ing in a friend's backyard, but would be kind of surprising even at a dinner party. I will wait 2-3 months to let them work out the snags before trying it again."
1,I love coming here to watch the latest movies and spend time with my daughter!
0,"This place should be closed!\nI took a girlfriend there...I was very hesitate as the casino itself looks cruddy. My friend ordered the steak and lobster for $11.99, the waiter told us the deal started at 9pm...we needed to wait another 15 min. We ordered the kickin shrimp...it was soggy and looked disgusting. We sent it back.  Then some Maxwell Smart looking dude came to our table...not to discuss the shrimp order we returned but to inform us we could not be seated before 9pm to order the lobster special. We got that resolved by the manager. My friends steak which was ordered medium rare was well done. That was returned to get the same thing. Finally, she said she would try to eat it...we just wanted to leave.  As she was cutting this dry tough steak, it flared to the ground.  You do NOT want to go here"
0,"I went to Sushi Room last week and it was horrible. The service and food was real bad. I live in Chandler and there are a handful of great sushi joints in the area, this is not one of them. To start, the waiting staff was wearing street clothes, ie tee shirt and jeans with stains. Secondly, they were out of the first 2 things I attempted to order. Thirdly, no one knew what type of fish was on the sashimi platter... it took 3 employees to explain one would be tuna, tyellowtail, and the last 3 are just chosen randomly. So, when we received our sashimi platter, 3/5 fish were seared... I definitely will not go back. The Living Room is a great place to go for food and drinks and I have been going there for a while, the Sushi Room should be located in the bathroom of the Living Room, not adjacent."
0,"I have been going to this location because we have a group that meets here once a month. I am not really a fan of their food. I much prefer Wildflower's choices, And the attitude of people behind the counter has always been like- I'm doing you a favor by making this sandwich or salad or whatever."
1,"Terre is WONDERFUL! I've been going to him for a couple years and I'm happy that he's at a new place.  Everyone's really nice.  The salon is neat, clean and well appointed. I totally want to sit on the couches (ok, I want to nap on the couches). \n\nI've been coloring my hair for over 15 years (premature gray) and no one does color as well as Terre.  Its AMMMMMMMAZING.  He's also the only one who's ever showed me how to style my hair properly.  He taught me tricks to make my hair look amazing with little effort.  My dream would be to have him do my hair and makeup for something, anything...he is a MAC diva and has great style.  \n\nBEST cut. BEST color. I'm a show-stopper when I leave."
0,"The actual maids that came to my house were very punctual efficient and hard working. However, the other aspects of the service were very terrible. The main office that you call is hard to deal with and don't answer the phone. The main reason we called the service is to get the landscaping maintenance too. The guy came when I was not home, trimmed three out of the seven bushes in my yard and left without blowing out his mess. We called the office after finally getting in touch they said they would send him back and he did come back and blew bush pieces everywhere and still didn't trim the other bushes and asked us if we wanted to pay for another service.  We will never use this service again!!!"
0,"Meh.  \n\nWe were able to get a reservation to Up, but when we arrived, we found that we did not need it because the place was practically empty for dinner around 6pm.  The decor was sparse and was bright, but they did bring the lights down about halfway through the meal.  It had a nice urban/modern look, but if the restaurant were full, it  may have been loud when full and with the music.  Up did not feel as crowded as other restaurants in the area.  I appreciate that they laid out the floor plan in a logical way instead of a 'let's see how many tables we can cram in here'-way.\n\nOur server was kind, attentive and informed about the menu.  The service was the best part of the meal.\n\nWe got Pate for an appetizer.  It was okay with interesting flavors, but I wouldn't get it again.  I had the Bolognese and my partner had ravioli.  The pasta was slightly undercooked.  My portion was adequate, but the ravioli portion was small.  They were both 'Meh' too.  I thought there was a lot of sweet flavors incorporated into a meal I expect to be more savory.  The presentation for the pate wasn't very good, but the others were presented better, but not to a level that one would consider elegant.  There wasn't anything bad about the food, but it just wasn't good either.   Needless to say, despite the portion size, our plates were left about half full and we didn't bother with a to-go box.  Although we usually get dessert, based on the appetizer and the meal, our expectations were too low.  \n\nThey were transitioning to a new menu at our visit, so perhaps the chef hasn't refined the menu yet."
0,"These apartments in Fort Mill were formerly called The Paddock. It was the most upscale, well managed complex in the Fort Mill, Rock Hill area. Beautiful landscaping, nice pool area, outdoor grills well maintained. No rodents, good pest control. Since the new owners have taken over it has gone down hill and no where near the amenities we had. Everything is broken, pool is closed, trash everywhere. And no answers are given for everything going up. Rent, water, garbage pick up. The response, if you don't like it we have plenty of people looking for a place to live. It doesn't even deserve a one star."
0,Horrible service!!! I didn't even get to eat. Lady acted like she was in drugs. She saw me taking my time and she totally walked away saying this isn't worth my time. Idk id she had a bad day or something but I walked right out and don't really care for it that much. There's plenty of sushi places out there
0,"I was really excited to dine at the Harvest Moon Grille.  I heard the restaurant was the place to find really great pork dishes being that the owner ran her own farm that raised pigs.  It was also part of the pitch the dining staff gave to us and other diners as they went through the specials.  \n\nI ordered the Grateful Grower's Pork Chop, which the waiter indicated was a favorite among their diners.  I must admit I was truly disappointed.  First at the small amount of food that I received given the meal's price, and secondly at the dish itself.  The portion of side dishes was so small that it looked more like garnish; however I could have accepted that if the chop was outstanding.  However, it was served lukewarm.  While it was juicy, it was quite bland.  While I realize some restaurants don't brine their chops, which I love, this dish really was lacking.  I guess I expected more from a restaurant that prides itself on pork dishes.  However, I will say the wait staff was friendly and accommodating.\n\nHowever, you can get a better pork chop at Customshop  and at The Liberty (where's it cheaper and you get more).  If the place was cheaper I might would give it another try, but I rather spend my money elsewhere.  In the end, I found the place overpriced and extremely mediocre."
0,Would have given them 5 stars if I could have gotten my Fudgey the Whale cake...nope...they are out of business.

0,"I feel awful giving only 2 stars because the restaurant itself is awfully pretty, and our server was so incredibly sweet. However, our food was terrible! I had a caprese to start, and I have no idea how they managed to ruin it, but it was inedible. Literally every person at my table groaned when they took their first bite of their food - except one person. It's also a bit pricey, so I was surprised by how poor the food was. Boooo.."
1,"One of the highlights of my week was swinging by Royal at the Market in downtown phoenix's public market for a fantastic cup of coffee. When I moved offices to the Biltmore area, I was thrilled to hear that Royal was opening a location downstairs from the Red Door Spa. \n\nThe drip coffee here is perfect. Royal's beans are roasted to perfection in small batches. Then, the beans for each cup of coffee are ground seconds before the cup is made (they aren't pre-brewed and left to get stale in a big thermos).\n\nThe baristas here are friendly, knowledgeable and actually know how pull a shot of espresso. I don't often get espresso based drinks, but when I do, they are excellent. \n\nThe Biltmore has long lacked a decent coffee place. Now, with prices lower than Starbucks (on every single drink), and quality FAR exceeding that of Starbucks, the Royal has filled an important niche. Don't get it to go. Sit down and enjoy a cuppa."
1,"I've eaten at Orange Table somewhere around 50 or 60 times over the last few years and I can tell you that they consistently provides 4-5 star quality food which I absolutely love.  The \""monkey pancakes\"" with bananas and sliced almonds are one of my favorite breakfasts anywhere with nuts and maple syrup, the chipotle chicken sandwich is unbelievable, the balsamic mozzarella melt is incredible and the burgers (all of them) are some of the best I've had in town.  \n\nUnfortunately, as many other people have mentioned, this amazing food is often but not always delivered with 2-3 star quality service.  This review and the 4 stars are not meant to excuse the poor service but I will tell you that I have never had a bad meal there.  Ever.  Patience is a virtue and a necessary one in this case.  I would give 5 stars on food alone but conversely just can't justify lowering the rating to a 3 based on slow service as many others have done.  My advice - plan on spending some time there, know the deal ahead of time and just be cool.  Your food will come out, perhaps even without a smile but this place is absolutely worth it."
1,"I knew it was going to be good when our group arrived on a Saturday afternoon at 435pm only to find we were early and no one was around. But by 5pm opening time there were quickly 10 others at the door waiting to get in and I thought how did they sneak by?!? Well we were actually waiting in the lot at our car so no biggie.\n\nGreat recommendation from a good friend from Mayo Scottsdale. Great sporting decor, warm ambience. Came again with kids (2 two year olds, an eleven year old and one thirteen year old) and a few adults.\n\nRibs, chicken, fish (Mahi mahi), potatoes, fries, broccoli all made with care with quality ingredients and quite tasty. A little expensive but I think it was worth it given the quality of food and the excellent service. Even the childs portions were a good value given the portions. I ordered prime ribs which isn't on the menu but is indeed the prime ribs after the steak portion has been cut off. You have to get there early to get this and only by request since again, it isn't on the menu. Cool."
1,"I took my Yelp friend Irene V. here the other day to get a pedicure with me and I was not surprised when she said she loved the place!  \nSigh, I'd let you in on my secret haven. Imagine the Barber Shop, that the kind of place this is in real life. Place is clean, unpretentious and the price extremely reasonable. There are two ladies there who does the pedi and mani. A spa pedi is $22 (only!) and a gel French manicure is $25 (only!). I have been going to Traci but both Traci and Eva will do a fantastic job. \nThey also have hair cut, coloring, lash extension, and facial services. \nWhat I mean though about it being like the Barber Shop is that I do on occasion go in to shoot the breeze with the ladies. Both of them are extremely nice and friendly and we will sit around and chat as though we're sitting on a front porch somewhere waving our fans, having lemonade. \nThere you have it- the best kept secret and my safe haven has been yelped!!!\nWell, guess these ladies are so nice and so great- everyone should know about them. Except of course when I want to get my nails done or go in for a chat!!!!"
1,Wow!!!! Best Ramen I've had since Japan.....amazing spicy miso tonkotsu ramen.....and the gyoza was wonderful. Five stars from me because the service and ambiance made the whole package five stars!!!
1,Be very specific up front if you need the interior glass cleaned and dashboard dusted. I've unfortunately driven away and not had a decent clean inside of the car. \nNice staff and hard workers! Be sure to tip the guys up front vacuuming and not just on the tail end... Think about it: which do you think is harder !? lol
1,"I'm torn on my review because breakfast buffet is a 5 star but dinner was maybe a 3 star. Very disappointed in the dinner buffet. However, the breakfast buffet was awesome! Maple syrup with pecans  in it. OMG, I think I gained 10 pounds last week I ate so much. Breakfast was so fresh! Large variety and clean.  However, the dinner buffet must have hade a different crew of workers on and was the complete opposite. Try the breakfast!"
1,"They have breakfast and lunch pretty well figured out. They don't have *everything*, but what they do, they do well.\n\nWe've had the bad luck of having one certain server several times that isn't as good as the others. Doesn't ask what kind of bacon you want of the eight choices, nor which  sides for sandwiches. She couldn't figure out how to accommodate a flavored green tea."
1,"Had lunch and was pleased with the quality of the food, the portion size, the service, and the physical layout of the restaurant. We were promptly seated and the waitress was very quick to the table with the salsa and bean dip.  This was a plus in that you don't often get bean dip with the traditional salsa. They were both spicy enough to get the tongue tingle and it was nice that both my wife and I received our own bowls and did not have to share. They have an extensive menu and had two of my favorites which are chili Colorado and adobada.  I ordered the adobada plate and for $8 it was very good and plentiful. I had the black beans which were also very good. The rice was average but I like to pile some salsa on it so it worked out fine.  My wife had the layered chicken New Mexico enchilada with green sauce which was pretty dang spicy, lots of hatch chile's(also at $8)!  The waitress was friendly and efficient and we will certainly return."
0,So we show up here to get something to eat it was nine in the morning door was locked no problem will ring the bell the buzzer to get in ring ring ring ring no answer ring ring ring ring no answer so after waiting a few minutes ring ring ring then the bartender comes on the intercom to say you guys will not be getting n ringing the buzzer like that or reply was like what? We've been sitting here for over 5 minutes is what I said she said no you haven't I been watching you guys so the question is why are you watching this instead of allowing us to come in to eat breakfast definitely bad customer service this bartender should be fired
1,I was very happy with the service of this company. The Jet ski rental was great and performed to its full potential.  Very happy and will rent from them again.
0,"The service was ok, but the food was disappointing. Food was very bland and did not have much flavor. I've been to other Japanese restaurants wayy better than this one."
1,This place is all about the hotel and the shops.  It's a great place to visit and have fun.  They are more expensive than a lot of the other casinos.  The Bourbon Room (bar) is a total rip off.  Don't order a beer or a drink there.  You'll pay more than you think.

0,After a long day of moving boxes out of my house into a storage I was exhausted by the time I arrived to Home Depot. I needed a u-haul truck to transport the remainder of items out my house which btw I needed to have out the house that day. I go to customer service and speak with one lady about renting a truck overnight. First she said that she didn't think they did overnight renting and it was almost closing time so I wouldn't be able to get one that day for the use of same day. She was uncertain whether they did overnight because of some recent things that had occurred. She spoke with the Assistant manager over the phone who told her that she could go ahead and rent me an overnight vehicle. I went back to my car to let my boyfriend know what was going on. As I returned into the store the lady I had been dealing with sent me over to another cashier to take care of this. This new lady has no clue about what I needed assistance with and has to ask the lady who sent me to her. While they are talking things over they then start doubting whether it will be okay to rent me the van and the new lady calls someone ( the assistant manager ) who comes to front right away and now says they will not be renting me the vehicle for overnight due to a recent situation that happen with one of the vehicles. I got really pissed off because the assistant manager switched up his decision and I had waisted valuable time there walking away without a truck. It basically was up to the assistant manager to decide if he wanted to allow a truck being rented for overnight. When the first cashier called him he should not have told her it was okay to rent me the truck for overnight. That particular location will never get my business again. They were all a bunch of.... Never mind i'll be nice. Located off serene and eastern.

I read through yelp and decided to give a chance. I believe her name was Karla cute blonde from San Diego, is the bomb! Made me feel so comfortable, staff was awesome and totally relaxed watching a movie as I got waxed. Oh and totally loved the bling skull and crossbones glitter tattoo! Huge hit! I will be recommending this place to all my girlfriends! Totally love it!"

1,I know others have been a little harsh on this location.  I have to say I like it though.  I have to confess that I do not drink coffee but I get hot chocolate and tea here.  \n\nThe biggest cons of this place is the cleanliness.  It is sometimes a little dirty but normally there are not a lot of people on staff and with the shop being open 24 hours a day it is hard to get the place super clean. Also being in the same shopping center with a bunch of other restaurants and Las Vegas Fitness Club it can be a real pain to turn left into the shopping center.\n\nThe upside to this place if the atmosphere.  I like the general chatter and coziness of the place.  I like to come here and work on school work or write reviews for Yelp.  :D  It is pretty easy to get to a plug to keep my computer running and I can get a drink and/or a snack when I am starting to digress  from homework.
0,"Aint nothing better than good ol' carne Asada fries! \n\nThis location is pretty ungenerous with their portions.. Unlike their other locations! When I order carne asada fries they limit the amount of meat they put on it. And 90% of the time when I say \""No Beans\"", they always  give me beans! \n\nI've only been inside once and I suggest just going thru the drive thru. So you can avoid coming out smelling like carne asada. The drive thru is pretty fast surprisingly. \n\nThere's always this homeless man at the end of the drive thru trying to wash your windows. It kind of creeps me out because he won't stop talking to you."
0,"Didn't eat but was lured by an impressive Tequila lineup.  They had our favorite (Casa Nobles Anejo).  But the bartenders were pretty poor at mixing a good margarita.  I asked for a Grand Marnier float and he poured it in the shaker after the tequila.  The mixes they used were mediocre at best.  The drinks were  $14, similar ones would hit $18-$20 at the \""finer\"" bars.  Kind of sad to have really good tequila but not the bar talent, although given the appearance of the place as a basic taco joint, I didn't expect much."
0,"First, the good: it's a very pretty converted old mansion that now serves as a hotel. There's a small bar on the main level of the main house, and the bartender was very good. We also enjoyed the breakfast and the peaceful setting not too close to the city. The bad: we stayed here so we wouldn't have to drive around and could go out to dinner and have some drinks. Our cab never arrived, so we ended up having to drive anyway. They pulled our car around and didn't lock it, which wasn't that concerning given the area but annoying nonetheless. The real complaint: we woke up the next morning covered in ants. They were in the bed, all over the linens and swarming up the walls. We took photos and showed them at the front desk, and they didn't even apologize let alone offer us something for the horror of waking up in a bed full of ants. They said only: \""they spray every month.\"" Never again will I stay here despite the otherwise pleasant atmosphere."
0,Worst salsa I have ever tasted. They also would not modify the menu to fit my request. What kind of place doesn't modify a menu for a customer. I will not return!
1,Best turn down service - the Housekeeping staff is fabulous from the mints to ice in the bucket when you come back.  The rooms are nice first time I had seen the tub on the other side of the shower stall.  The hotel  in general with the fresh scented air to the upscale vibe that doesn't leave you wanting a shower after entering would make this a fist choice on the next trip to Vegas.
0,"Slow and with a service that leaves lots to desire.  Food is not that good either.  My fork was dirty enough to look like it hadn't been washed at all and my wife's french toasts actually tasted like sausage (maybe using the same pans for everything?)\n\nOverall, just a \""meh\"" (or even \""below meh\"") restaurant."
1,My boss says his body is a temple and won't eat anywhere else but Blue Fin.  So he took me there for my birthday.  So good...their salad has an amazing dressing (not sure what the taste is).  The ladies knew my boss and were very personable.  I go back often.  I get the teriyaki chicken with brown rice.  Reasonably priced and the ladies are so sweet.
0,"I was never going to write a review of this awful place as I couldn't justify the modest effort it would take to push the computer keys on  a review of such a low-brow, bland restaurant. But then I read a positive review a few before this one and I had to chime in.\nOkay...here goes:\nCompared to this place, the Olive Garden is Joel Robuchon. \nHowever if you think that tasteless food (in large quantities), served by bored, zombie wait-staff is something to cheer about, and you've hit all the buffets in town, then perhaps this is your kind of place.\nHowever, if food with taste and style and care is what you're willing to pay hard-earned dollars for, then this is the Gateway to Hell.\nGod help all who enter."
0,The Perkins here has never been known for being staffed with happy people.  I found that they continue the tradition with my recent visit for lunch.\nNow I was looking forward to seeing the new place as they really needed a refresher and a clean up.   The new place helps but I'm not so sure I like the layout.  It is small and boxy.  I liked the old layout better.   But the place is brighter which is nice.\nThe food was pretty good so no fault there.  But the service was subpar.   I felt like they could care less if I ate there or not.   We joked around a little with our waitress and she barely cracked a smile.   The manager came by and asked us if everything was ok and when we said it was she stated that she was glad to hear that in a sort of canned way while she was walking away.  Once again giving us the impression that she could care less.\nNow we saw our waitress at another point away from our table and think that she was stressed out over something.  So whatever it was was showing up in her attentiveness to her customers.  We still gave her a good tip because she looked like she needed it.\nBottom line is I won't be going back here for some time until the management and staff change over which I suspect it will in about 6 months.  See you then.
0,"I went here once when it was Light back in 2002-ish and it sucked.  Then, revisited it as The Bank in 2008.  The club itself is nice but small.  Decorated with a lavish decor.  The doormen and bartenders are friendly.  It doesn't take too long to get a drink.  The prices are average for a Vegas club.  The music is typical.  The crowd is mixed.  Everything from early 20s to late 40s and all ethnicities.  It was hot as hell in here though.  Turn up the AC!    \n\nThe one time I went here I had fun but I wouldn't go again my group wanted to go and I was getting in for free.  I wouldn't pay to get in here."
0,"I've been coming to this location for two reasons, good service, and entertainment from the bus stop outside.  However, recently, I've experienced not so great service.  Gosh, I wish the teens working at night would just pay attention. Two weeks in a row now I've gotten the wrong order.  \n First one last week, cheesy gordita crunch with chicken. I got a hard shell taco w/ chicken, cheese, and lettuce in it.   Bean and cheese burrito....I got a beef and cheese burrito. Maybe it's my east coast accent? I don't know.   Yesterday, cheesy gordita crunch with chicken. I got a gordita with chicken and cheese. Um hi, either you don't carry that one anymore, or the person reading the recipe does not know what they're doing?  Hard shell chicken taco encased by a soft shell tortilla w/ cheese between the two shells.  What is the issue?  I'm going to try another location until these workers move on to the next job."

0,"Absolutely one of the worst places I've eaten. The food was luke warm, most of the meat dishes were well over cooked or burnt. Every dish tried was so bland it didn't matter if you were eating chicken and broccoli or the house special which was a spicy chicken, they both tasted the same! The squid was so over cooked you couldn't even chew it, the mussels had a home made spicy sauce that was labeled spicy but was as sweet as the orange chicken. If I was rich and bored I'd pay people NOT to eat here, it is that bad. Below average, even for a buffett.... Please save yourself and do not eat here!"
0,"HORRIBLE! My prescriptions are never the same price (including a couple that I pay cash for) They CONSTANTLY drop the ball, do not fill scripts as written and even charged the wrong insurance one time and gave me the correct drug but with the wrong name and address on the bottle!! Now today I was LIED TO regarding a prescription coupon card!! They do not care about the patient, will not spend 1 second of their time helping anyone! And do not care to even check information correctly.. Terrible terrible pharmacy!! And I didn't even mention trying to deal with them on a professional level being that I work at a doctors office and have patients who go here as well.."
1,"DONT JUDGE THE BOOK BY ITS COVER!! This place looks ghetto on the outside and we almost just passed, but I am so glad we didn't!!! It is beautiful and very clean inside.  Staff was very nice and attended to us quickly. The food was delicious and authentic. We are going to be regulars here. I'm really glad we gave it a chance"
1,"Having lived in Hawaii for over 5 years, I constantly have a craving for Hawaiian food. Moki's reminds me of little local restaurants in Hawaii. When I walk in I feel like I'm back in the islands. The atmosphere is very local style and the people are totally laid back. The decor has a do-it-yourself feel that IS local kine. \n\nI've tried every Hawaiian restaurant in the Valley and this is by far my favorite. I go back often and highly recommend Moki's to anyone looking for some great Hawaiian eats!"
1,"i live in l.a. and asked for a great rib rest. while visiting the vegas area and i was told of this new place in henderson  just opened so i tried it,there was 5 of us and we all loved the ribs and chicken the sides where delicious.  but best of all was the friendly people there i  will be going back on my next trip there, its as good as any rib place i've been too."
1,I went there for my first date. The service was wonderful. The steak was also wonderful and I love love love their frites. I would definitely visit agaib
0,"Was not impressed. The seaweed salad was drowned in sesame oil and every roll was entirely overwhelmed by sauce (there was a quarter cup of garlic sauce left on the plate when we finished the Primo roll, no hint of exaggeration.) And for a place that charges for forks, you'd think they'd pack the rolls a little tighter so they don't utterly disintegrate. It was heavy, heavy fare and we left feeling overfull and gross even though we ate about half as much as we usually do on sushi night (and both had gas pains for a couple of hours afterward).\n\nThe free strawberry ice cream was not delicious and the fortune cookie was downright weird."
0,"Horrible! Please don't waste your time or money. I got a pedi and gel layover with gel polish and two days later the gel start peeling. Two thumbs down! They should change the name to \""Nails you Hate\"""
0,"Atrocious service. My trip here led to a shouting match with the manager. We purchased a groupon for a party of four. The other couple cancelled, and the restaurant manager refused to honor the groupon, even though it would have resulted in us spending more money than we would have.\n\nApparently they are all good on cash here, so don't bother giving them any of yours. Never had a worse dining, or in this case a \""not-dining\"" experience in my life. \n\nCan't wait to see this place turned into more parking lot. Their terrible management is going to make that happen sooner than later."
1,"This restaurant helps to provide some Asian food variety to the Champaign-Urbana area. While the food isn't great, most of the dishes are relatively solid. The banh mi is really the best choice over here and I'd say the pho was probably my least favorite. It's not that easy to find Vietnamese food in most of the midwest though (outside of big cities and some campus towns) so it's nice to have a solid choice."
0,"Don't plan on getting picked up by Yellow if you are in Lawrenceville past midnight. I waited for over an hour for Yellow Cab on a visit two months ago and the driver never showed. We ended up getting a ride by a mysterious guy who drives a car with no cab markings named \""Mr. C\"" or something. Last weekend we were in the process of waiting over an hour when I decided to download the Lyft application. I had a ride lined up, an ETA and an actual conversation with the driver within minutes."
1,"I have eaten here several times. Has always been clean. I enjoy the bright lighting over dim lit little buffets. Staff was always very friendly and the sushi is surprisingly good. I have always arrived very close to opening, as I always do with a buffet. Food is always more fresh close to opening. Thinking about going there today actually :-)"
1,"Tootie's is basically a carry out shop.  One high table and two stools....that is all there is.  \n\nVery tasty italian season beef with perperoncinis on top with a few other veggies including onions.  Tasty, tasty, tasty.  Nice and filling.\n\nThe only other option on the menu is Sausage or a combo of sausage & beef.  Very friendly service."
1,"Best thai beef noodle soup!! Okay, I've really only tried the one here and then at thai style noodle house...but this one wins hands down!  Small hole in the wall restaurant with very friendly service staff.  The thai beef noodle soup has a richer beef broth with a more savory flavor than the thai style noodle house version.  It also comes with a generous portion of beef balls/beef slices/tendon/tripe.  There is also the option of different noodles (egg/wide noodle/etc).  If you are a pho lover...try this thai style version...you will not be disappointed!"
1,"Here in Charlotte from out of town. Just had an awesome lunch. Great drinks, guacamole at the table was made to order. The fish tacos were awesome and my wife had shredded beef tacos, the beef was very tasty.  The pico de gallo at the table was the best."
0,"For the love of pete and moss don't waste your time standing around waiting for this burlesque type show. My husband said he and my son had watched it and wanted to take my dad over to see it. We got down there early to get up front, stood around talking, and had been there about 30 minutes and it was five minutes before show time and suddenly looking around you realize you are packed in like sardines with tons of people. \n\nThey announce they may cancel the show due to high winds. But, no, they go about five minutes late. It is not even cheesy, it is just plain stupid. The girls are pretty the guys are nice looking, it is just really a sad attempt at something, I am not sure what, raunchy rumor? That doesn't bug me, I can roll with the best and some of it was funny, but it was hard to get past because for some reason, it was just so stupid in general. It is harsh, but if it saves you from running all the way down there, it is worth it. I would have never went back if I had saw it once. \n\nMy dad liked it though, of course, girls barely dressed dancing on a stage with some special effects thrown in. That is why I threw an extra star at it, because some people do enjoy whatever that was."
1,"The service here is friendly and efficient, the food fresh with a number of vegetarian options and the prices very reasonable. The $9 glass of sauvignon Blanc was very good."
0,"Wow... You guys have OFFICIALLY hit a new low! First, you pulled a massively sneaky pete by tricking my fiance into a 2 year contract by offering a $100 promotion (and of course, forgetting to mention that accepting the promotion would mean a contract), then, after visiting the store, and calling several times to speak with your utterly incompetent reps, he finally managed to get the account canceled - double and triple checking that everything was completely paid. Now, mysteriously, several months later, we get a call from a COLLECTIONS agency stating that we owe AT&T money. When we called you guys to find out what the hell was going on - your unfortunate excuses for reps A. Couldn't find the account, and B. Upon finding the account didn't have any good excuses or reasons for not notifying us of an outstanding balance (especially since we made more than enough efforts to make sure that everything was 100% taken care of). Not only did we get a major attitude from not only your reps, but the sassy \""supervisor\"", but now we're also having to deal with some collection agency to get this taken care of. \n\nPLEASE SPARE YOURSELF THE HEADACHE AND NEVER DO BUSINESS WITH AT&T!!!!"

1,"Around $200 for a Deluxe Suite (Including tax, resort fees).It's not exceptionally high, but it wasn't a deal either. The room was a little small, however:\n\n+1 Stove & microwave\n+1 panoramic view of the strip, beautiful view, can even see bellagio fountains\n+1 2 flat screen TVs\n+1 Nice big tub, with shower head\n+1 queen size pull out bed\n+1 sleek d\u00e9cor\n+1 dining table\n+1 internet included in resort fee\n-1 was supposed to come with slippers but i didn't see any\n-1 single sink\n-1 black out curtains were not, black out\n-1 no hand towel hanger\n-1 toilet was weird, not releasing water quick enough\n-1 no casino\n-1 pull out bed was very uncomfortable, I've slept on better rollaways.\n\nDespite all this, I was very impressed with the design of the room. It's definitely one of the nicer normal rooms I've been to, with only Trump being more luxurious. However, the d\u00e9cor of these suites are much more modern and less pretentious. On the other hand, I did pay less at Trump.\n\nI didn't really deal with the service except when we tried to get them to have a plumber come look at the toilet at 4am, it took them a while so we cancelled it. Room service came relatively prompt when we asked for extra towels and bedding.\n\n***\n\nTip: Free valet, although you should tip. Definitely valet before you check in/check out because self parking is far! Taxi lines are never long. There is a bridge that goes to Bellagio directly!\n\nFavourites: A nice room for the price, pretty good location. nice view\n\nDo not want: lack of food, casino, fold out bed sucked! crikets at night when you walk to aria!\n\nLast words: A nice stay, great location."
0,"We were really excited to try this restaurant because we heard the restaurant in Chicago was a must try I even checked out their menu that intrigued me more I also was curious about this Asian fusion street food concept.  We went earlier in the evening so it wasn't busy at all maybe three parties sitting in the restaurant.  Out of all the tables for a party of two she sits us closest to the smoky loud casino.  So I request to sit some where more on the inside, I didn't understand this concept for a nice strip restaurant.  \nSo we ordered 2x fried chicken, Logan poser ramen, House made pickles, Japanese griddle cake, Grilled chicken wings.  I wasn't too impressed with any of them maybe the ramen then the grilled chicken wings.  I don't know what it was with our choices but everything seemed to have a strong sour after taste.  Like after drinking a shot of vinegar.  Even the ramen had something sour in it which kind of threw our flavor palette into thinking why does all of our food taste sour or have a sour ingredient in it.  The prices for the food was the normal strip price, but the amount and quality and quantity u want for the money u are paying for, eh, it's just not worth it for me.  Oh we tried the soft serve dessert and yep there was some kind of ingredient in there that they added as a sprinkle the made it sour too the soft serve was a expresso flavor, we didn't know what to make of it.  We see the concept and seems really interesting. The menu has interesting fusions and ingredients used.  But none of the flavors in our dishes was impactful or wow just so so and let's u leave the place thinking it wasn't worth it enough.   I may try another time but doesn't seem likely."
1,We actually had the brunch buffet here which I was fairly pleased with.  There is a plenty to choose from and it is a good deal if you want to avoid the more expensive buffets that are found elsewhere around the Strip.  I enjoyed all that I got and my husband loved that fried rice was included on the menu.
0,"Since nothing at ASU is really free anymore, at least having a free bus system (which won't be free anymore) is nice to take advantage of. Especially in the summer.  unfortunately the orbit, formally known as the neighborhood flash, doesn't quite make the free part worth it.  Sure  its nice that it goes to the little areas that you would usually have to walk to, but since it's free anyone can get on.  If you get a good bus driver he'll probably go the speed limit and stop at the actual orbit stop. Some bus drivers open the doors before they stop as if saying 'tuck and roll'.  I am not trying to get rid of the free service so soon, but if paying a little bit for better service and safety is what it takes...so be it! At least it could fund drivers that won't be texting and smashing the orbit busses into our brand new light rail system."
0,"The place is very old, we got a suite and it's huge, but very old, carpet damaged, stained, shower is awful, bathroom is very old, scratches and all.

1,"The wife and I frequent this amazing place regularly. Most of the time we head in there for lunch as they have an early bird offer of, 2 courses for \u00a311 or 3 courses for \u00a314!\n\nThe last time we were there I had the, Red wine braised ox cheek pithivier,\nHornig's black pudding, red wine jus for a starter and the fish and chips for a main. Both were excellent. \n\nService has always been good with only the odd long wait for the bill when they are very busy. I always ask for the bill as they collect the dessert plates to speed this up.\n\nSo, just how good is this place? Well..... I have made the suggestion to the waitress that they build a private plate licking room so that diners can lick the plates clean without everyone thinking they are nuts!\n\nOne word of warning. They no longer accept American Express."
1,"Sign #1 that I am getting older.  I have a favorite grocery store.  \n\nYes...I have shopped many...Randall's, HEB, Super Wal-Mart & Target, Harris Teeter, Food Lion, Bloom (RIP), Bi-Lo, Fiesta, Safeway, Giant, Whole Foods, Central Market, Trader Joes, Sunflower.  The list keeps going.  \n\nAll make me pine for Publix.  Now we in the Charlotte area have a NEW, BIG, BEAUTIFUL Publix to enjoy.  \n\nFor those not familiar with the beauty of Publix let me wow you:\n1. Double Coupons up to 50 cents everyday.\n2. Free help to your car with your bags...they will never take tips.  \n3. Amazing deli sandwiches and Bakery.  Seriously...ahhhmahhhzing.\n4. Best selection of delicious store made sides ever.  Try the southern potato salad.  Better than my mom's....almost.\n5. Seafood department to rival the coast.\n6. A store that you enjoy being in- No flies, not sticky spots on the floor, no burned out lights, no broken carts.  \n7. FRIENDLY PEOPLE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n\nI know that they are not as cheap as Wal-Mart but they also seem to care about the people who shop at their store and the people who work there.  \n\nI live 25 miles away and have already been twice.  Harris Teeter has really let their stores go and now with Whole Foods and Publix moving in I hope that they step up their game.  \n\nCan't wait for them to take over Charlotte.

0,"No, no, no, no. That's all I can say if you are planning on eating here.  \n\nMy daughter and I went in today, on a Sunday afternoon, because we couldn't find another Mexican restaurant that was open on Sunday in central Phoenix. The service was fine but the food was awful. The beans tasted like they came from a can (Rosarita brand) and the salsa was just barely palatable for the same reason. We each ate only half of our food before  leaving.  \n\nWhen the waiter asked how the food was, I told him and all he did was say he was sorry. No offer to bring something else or comp one of our half-eaten meals. \n\nMacayo's on Central used to have fresh food, now it is just stale and tastes like it comes from a can. You can definitely tell that they are cutting corners in the kitchen. For the prices they charge, You have a right to expect better food. \n\nI will never go there again."
1,"Great happy hour specials with all wines at half price, appetizers at half price and flatbreads at half price.  The wine list was a full page and included all the wines; not just house wines at some places.  I have had better bruschetta at Postino's but the flatbreads were good for sharing.\n\nIf a lot of people showed up there would be a definite space problem on the inside. There is a half booth and three half booths with two chairs each in the bar area.  The bar itself is square with more than a dozen cushioned bar chairs.  \n\nOne could eat on the outside but who in his \""right\"" mind would want to sit on the patio very long in the never ending summer heat,,, yeah sure, it is a dry heat but not for long..."
0,"First off, my wife and I are 'die hard' Target fans, so it pains me a bit to write this review. I will be taking my business elsewhere after my experience tonight. \n\nThe intent of our visit to Target this evening was to buy a new grill. However, instead of leaving with a state of the art grilling machine, I left the store empty handed, with a bad attitude, and with a terrible taste in my mouth. \n\nWhen we walked back to the area of the store where this Target displays their grills, the area was being remodeled for new products to be displayed. But there were a couple of nice grills out on display, one of which, I planned on purchasing for nearly $300. \n\nI asked an employee for help and he mentioned \""I don't work that area\"" and he called someone over who would help, apparently. The gentleman came over, I asked him general questions about price and availability which he was unsure of both. I asked if I could purchase the floor model and he replied \""we can't sell the display model because of liability concerns.\"" \n\nWhy would you put products out on display that you can't sell? I was going to spend $300 just like that...but this Target doesn't need the additional revenue apparently."

1,I love to explore dive bars in every city I visit because it's an opportunity to meet locals and learn about other must see spots.  This is a cash only bar and there is no sign that informs you of this. It is just assumed because of its location and the dive reputation. I went during the day so got seats right on the bar.  There were only a few people.  I don't know how crowded it gets during evening hours.  Very friendly bartender and customers.  I would definitely go again.
0,"Nice room.  Once I got past that, I was treated to a circus of many unavailable menu items, uninspired food (that was available), larcenous prices, and a triple crown of clumsy, thoughtless, inattentive service.  What a waste of a beautiful space.  If the kitchen can figure out how to deliver value for money, & the servers can figure out how to make any moment a customer service moment, they might have something.  But right now it's just pretentious nonsense.  Lovely interior, though."

I highly recommend the peanut butter and dark chocolate gems, though every flavor is special.

Tiffany is such a pleasure to work with!"
0,"Stopped in during happy hour for a light bite and a drink. Sat at the bar and ordered a glass of their house Cab. With one other person at the bar, you'd think the service would be reasonable. The only other time I saw the bartender was when my glass was empty. I ordered another thinking she'd offer me a menu at least...never happened!! So I paid requested my bill and went somewhere else to eat. Btw, my bill for 2 glasses of \""house\"" wine during happy hour was more than $15!!! Other servers appeared to be much more customer-focused."

1,"Not bad! Not bad at all. Pretty expensive coffees/smoothies and other drinks but overall a pleasant experience for me. My bf and I waited 10-15 min before we got a table, and that was good for an extremely busy Saturday morning. I really enjoyed my hot chocolate, it was rich and tasty. My bf's smoothie tasted non diluted, not overly sweet and fresh. And of course, there were the cats! We sat near Gustave, a cat that was lounging around near our table at the corner. I really liked the fact that this cat cafe had nooks and crannies/crevices for for the cats to hide and sleep in. \n\nMy only complaint is that our food took FOREVER to get to your table. I think more than 45 min. It was crazy. I thought they forgot about us. However! My cat lady sandwich was excellent and the salad was tasty. It was a healthy menu and I appreciated that and the portion size not being too much. Nothing I hate more than huge huge portions.\n\nI would visit again for sure! And I recommend visiting here just to try something new if you're in the plateau area. Service was of course pretty decent as well,"
0,"Maybe it was a particularly bad day, so I might have to try this place again, but the drink I had was awful. Almond boba milk tea. It tasted like watered down regular milk tea. I couldn't taste any almond. And even if it was regular milk tea, it was still dilute. There was no creaminess or tea flavor. The consistency of the boba was decent.. comparable to a Lollicup. Maybe I'll try this place again and update my review."
0,"I went in last night 6/11/14 and purchased a new Xbox One at about 8:40 pm \nI took my new Xbox home and set it up and when I put in one of the games I also just purchased the machine made a grinding noise and the game would not play. I put in another game in also just purchased in the same transaction in the system and the same thing happened. brand new Xbox doesn't work... by this point the store was closed for the night so I waited till 10 am this morning 6/12/14 to call and tell the opening manager about the defective product and he tells me first of all that \""that's how the machine works\"" when I said no the issue is its not working he tells me  that it's not his problem, it the system had been a used one that they would replace it but since I bought it new that it was on me.\n\nI purchased this item less than 24 hours prior for your company and this exact store no less and you don't stand by the product you sold me? Everyone was perfectly happy to take my almost $600 with a great big smile on their face but when the damn thing is defective then it's on me?!? so for my $600 dollars I bought a broken machine and an hour on the phone with Microsoft who tells me they have an agreement with distributors of their product to do these kinds of replacements in the store if the product is defective they tell me that since this store wont honor the agreement that they will send a replacement so after my hour plus on the phone with them I now have to wait an additional 3 days or so for them to send a new one and mail them back the defective unit they sold me. \n\nadditionally Microsoft put a $500 hold on my credit card to ship me the replacement so now i have spent over $1,000 and i have a non working Xbox one and a wait that's what i bought from game stop\n\nand here's a fun fact the manager refused to take my Xbox back but there receipt clearly says that i can have an equal exchange it within 30 days. sounds like someone doesn't know his own stores policy... \n\nI wonder what the BBB will have to say about this."
0,"Where do I begin . . \n\n\nI ordered a pizza and breadsticks and the man on the phone said it would be delivered around 30-45 minutes later . . \n\nSo after an hour I called to see if maybe the delivery guy got lost or couldn't find my home and the same guy answered the phone and had no idea what I was talking about he then said \""oh uhh yea we uh just got the pizza so he'll leave now and be there soon \"" I had no idea what he meant by that but I took it as he hadn't even left yet  \n\nAfter another 40 minutes I called again and the same guy answered and said \""he left like 45 minutes ago he'll be there soon\"" and then said \""I told you it would be an hour and 45 minutes wait\""  . . umm no he did not or I would have just gone to pick it up myself  . . \n\nWhen the delivery guy finally arrived it had been two hours since I had placed the order and the Pizza and breadsticks were cold and the pizza and breadsticks both tasted terrible not at all how they usually taste  . . bland and just very bad in general (everyone agreed) \n\nand on top of everything else the delivery guy was extremely rude . . \n\nI always order through papa johns and I have for years but this was the 1st and the last time I will ever order from that location"
0,HORRIBLE SERVICE!!!  wow nothing good to say at all about this dump. Ordered a dinner dish. A ceaser salad and spaghetti. They gave me iceberg lettuce (crap) with a side of ceaser dressing. About 30 minutes later my meal comes out.  Sauce was cold.. Ten min later they finally bring it back...ABSOLUTE garbage for being in seven hiLLS. OH and you get to see the employees smoke cigs outside while your eating right in front of them. Its all can good food..i'd rather eat at pizza hut or cicis
1,"Rating: 4.5\r\n\r\nI came here one night with classmates about 8 months ago. We walked by one night to see it PACKED. I wanted to see what the fuss was about. I'm glad I did. =) \r\n\r\nI was here last week again for school, and luckily my bf was in town for work so I dragged him here with me. \r\n\r\nI have ordered/tried: \r\n\r\nLEMONADE - This tasted like a mix of lemonade and limonata so it had a dash of spritz. I liked it a lot, but my bf didn't.\r\n\r\nAHI TUNA ANTIPASTO - Good! \r\n\r\nSTETSON CHOPPED SALAD - Holy shit, I LOVE this salad! They were NOT kidding when they said this was a serious customer favorite. It is a mix of sweet corn, salmon, marinated tomatos, Cowboy Ciao trail mix, couscous, and chopped spinach. It is so yummy! I am definitely going to have cravings for this. My bf loved this too.\r\n\r\nMISO SPICY SQUID - This was really good calamari. It didn't have too much batter so you could actually taste the squid. And it wasn't over-fried. The pineapple salsa on top is an awesome compliment to it. \r\n\r\nSEARED SCALLOPS w/ DILL CREAM SAUCE & GOAT CHEESE - This was pretty tasty. I love dill and I love goat cheese; this was actually a nice combination. The scallops were cooked perfectly. \r\n\r\nRIB-EYE w/ AJI SAUCE - This was taken off the menu for some reason but it was cooked and seasoned perfectly (medium rare!). There was a hint of lovely and SPICY aji (Peruvian) sauce. Delicious. \r\n\r\nMINI MUSHROOM PANFRY- My bf and I didn't enjoy this. Although the mushrooms were cooked well, this dish had no flavor. We both love mushrooms so much and it was a disappointment that a dish with so much potential lacked flavor. \r\n\r\nPECAN-CRUSTED SALMON - OMG, this was incredibly delicious! My bf and I aren't really salmon people when it comes to non-Japanese food. The waiter told us that the sauce served with the salmon was really good, and that this was also a popular dish. We were so glad we took his advice. It was cooked medium-rare with a pecan crust. The combination of the sauce and light crust was so good. This is probably the only place that I would order salmon again. It was complimented with sauteed vegetables (Chinese brocoli, carrots, asparagus, onions, etc.)\r\n\r\nFIVE-O BREAD PUDDING  w/ COCONUT/PINEAPPLE, and BROWN SUGAR/PINEAPPLE ICE CREAM - This is your typical bread pudding, except for the added coconut/pineapple. The bread pudding itself was cooked very well. Tasty and firm, not too mushy like many bread puddings I've tasted. I love pineapple and coconut together (as in Pina Colada's), but it wasn't my favorite with the bread pudding. I did enjoy this dessert though, but I prefer it plain with a fruit sorbet like at Montrio's in Monterey (the best I've had!). \r\n\r\nOverall, I give this place a 4.5. The extra 0.5 stars for the creativity and uniqueness of the dishes and restaurant culture. It's extremely unique and definitely a local favorite! I just wish there was a Cowboy Ciao near me that I could dine at. Each time I go to AZ, I will be sure to stop by this tasty restaurant. Fine dining that is fun as well. Service is great."
1,I've been to a couple local crossfit gyms and this has the best staff of trainers I've seen. The group vibe is great for all levels of crossfit athletes
0,ordered 2 carnita tacos with rice/beans. The food was cold and everything was flavorless. The food was gross and super expensive. Maybe the actual restaurant is better.
0,"Okay... I've been hearing about this place since it opened and I figured that with it being across the street from and In-N-Out and still in business, it had to be amazing. I was very disappointed. The food was very expensive and the quality was only average. I really liked all the options for the burgers but the limited menu is just a little too limited. Only serving fries as a side is just not that interesting no matter how much season salt you shake on them. They had the awesome new Coca-Cola machines which was really neat to play with but where are the milkshakes and malts? This is a burger joint, gotcha, but I would like to see some creativity in my meal, especially at these prices. Maybe the free peanuts run up the cost of overhead..."
0,"Dim Sum: \n- shrimp dumplings\n- radish cake \n- shui mai \n- beef ball \n- beef rice noodle \n- shrimp rice noodle \n- steam pork ribs \n- veggies \n\nNONE OF THEM WAS GOOD ! Stay away from this place! The service was horrible too! I feel like I wasted my time, my money and my Calories intake here !"
0,"They were friendly and nice, but I ordered chicken curry wrap and immediately found a hair that stretched from one end of the wrap to the other in my first bite. For $11 I expect more. I won't be returning or recommending them to anyone I know."
0,"My wife and I had a 8 o'clock reservation at Zinc.  We were ushered to a two top in the traffic pattern, easily the worst table in the room.  there were several banquets available and we were told noway, no how we are fully booked.  One hour and ten minutes later all these tables were still empty. Our waitperson was efficient and officious.  we felt like we were more in a diner than a \""fine dining restaurant\"".  I had the chicken dish - $28.00 for about 6 ounces of chicken, 2 ounces of risotto and about 20 green peas?  Draft beers are served about 2/3rd of a glass at $7.00?  There isn't anything about Zinc that is French except for the Frisee salad and the attitude.  $140.00 plus. Way over rated.  One plus,\nThe ambiance is great."
1,"50's - 60's diner style with lots of period memorabilia & knickknacks (some for sale!). Great food & nice ambiance, but very slow service. Don't be in a rush & you'll enjoy it!"
1,They were very nice! Got me in right away-good price and GREAT pedi massage chairs!
0,Service was very friendly. But this location needs a deep cleaning. It is very dirty with dirty bathrooms. Cleanliness is not a priority for this location
0,"I just happened to pass by here on my long drive back to LAX.  I saw the sign which read \""wood fired pizza\"".  Thinking that this would mean that this place would have nice thin and crusty pizza, I drove in to get some for my drive.\n\nSurprisingly, they sold the pizza by the slice.  Most wood fired brick oven pizzas are sold by the mini-pie.  I asked for a slice and the gentleman behind the counter took a slice off of the heating cabinet and gave it to me.  I thought that was odd (I would have expected it to be placed into the oven to be heated).  I picked up the slice and immediately felt the droop of it.  The slice was just warm but more importantly, it was socking wet.  I gave it back to the guy and asked him to put it into the oven and make it extra crispy.  He did so and put it on a cookie sheet and put it into the oven.  3 minutes later he took it out of the oven and gave it back to me.  Now the slice was hot but the same drooping mess.  \n\nWOOD FIRED pizza should be crispy on the bottom and the crust - not wet on the bottom, droopy and a doughy \""crust\"".  Normally, it should be thin and crispy and served fresh.  This pizza is thick - like stuff I would get in a supermarket frozen department.\n\nI also ordered with this slice a Gyro.  I didn't think that gyros differed much from place to place but this was a semi-disaster too.  Unlike the pizza slice, this was much dryer.  There wasn't that much tsatziki yogurt sauce and more importantly, no lettuce at all.  It had 2 half slices of Tomato, some onions and of course the lamb but it felt half full.  Anywhere you go in LA and NY (where I'm from), Gyros are usually stuffed, lots of lettuce, tomato and yogurt sauce.  This felt like an imitation gyro in my opinion.\n\nI hate to leave negative reviews but this place I couldn't find anything good about it.\nThe place looked nice but unfortunately, the food was not."
0,Went there today to have my favourite beer and maybe some fish and chips - the place is closed with a chain and padlock round the door handles - closed for good I understand!
1,"This place was noted as a \""must visit\"" location during my last trip to Pittsburgh. I must say, it was definitely worth the visit. \n\nTo all reading this, be aware that essentially, this is just a grocery store we're talking about here. However, the rustic building, and kitchy offerings (like pour your own olive oil...or taste our 100cheeses) makes it kind of special. \n\nWhen I was given this recommendation, I was told \""head to the back to where the cheese is\"". So, I did. WHOA - so much more cheese than I ever expected. But no macaroni and cheese....boo. \n\nThey should really consider serving mac and cheese. \n\nThat's all."
1,"such a simple idea that works so well. how many times have i doused my ice cream in baily's, kahlua, frangelico, etc? all the time. yet it never occured to me to sell it....maybe that's why i'm still working for the man!\n\nwe had a coupon and hit this place up tonight...on scottsdale's chilliest night thus far. i must gripe...for such a beautiful area near the \""waterfront\"", there is hardly anyone out and about. and it's not that cold. in boston, this area would be crawling with people. \n\nno matter...more alcoholic ice cream for us. the owner....extremely friendly and outgoing. more than happy to explain what a simple concept it really was and how she was so excited to have her new business and we hoped along with her that she would succeed beyond compare. \n\ni had the breakfast thing (with cornflakes and alcohol), the kahlua one, and the tiramausu. absolutely delicious! my girl had the cherry one and the cherries soak up that alcohol. our friend had the rum raisin and they were super soaked with delicious alcohol. it all came with a sliver of waffle cone. \n\nalthough we didn't feel buzzed (maybe another gallon would do), we left happy to have found this place. support local business and enjoy the flavors of Lee's Cream Liqueur!"
0,"The beer is indeed cheap, can't be a $6 sampler, just wish it didn't arrive warm and sloshed all over. We sat at the bar and the bartender did not seem to care that we were there. We had to flail our arms around whenever we needed him (and no, it was not busy). Food was mediocre, nothing to write about, beer was decent (probably better cold)."
0,"Service is bleh, not very attentive or super friendly. Nothing crazy, but I guess it is the only ramen house in KW. The squid balls aren't as good as you'd think. And the bowls of ramen are extremely salty! I guess it's so you can order over priced drinks.. In my opinion the cheaper bowls new fill me up, so try the larger king bowls.\n\nBut skip the line, and go at odd times. It's one of those places that you go to in the moment, and then regret it once you find out how dehydrated you actually are from it. \n\n-heres a tip, go to the pie store afterwards and buy yourself some water."
0,We drove 25 minutes to this place because we had a $5.00 Restaurant.com gift certificate I bought last week. They would not let us use it; waitress said the boss isn't accepting them anymore. So we had to pay for the soda we ordered and then we left out of principal. You would think the owner would not want to lose a sale....not this one!
0,"The experience I had here could be summed up in one word: long. I was with a group of 9, and after a day of playing in the snow, we got really hungry. \n\nWe were first told that the wait was gonna be 25-30 minutes long, which we were okay with and then once seated, it took about 10 minutes for the waitress to get our drinks. Then another 10 minutes to actually get them. We had a look at the menu and everything was pretty overpriced, especially for a bunch of college kids. Once our orders were placed, it took about 50 minutes to get our food. I would've given it 1 star but the food was actually pretty good, but not $18 for a burger good. After eating, it took about 30 minutes for us to get our checks, then another 15 minutes to get our cards back. By that point, we were there for almost 2 hours. Not a pleasant experience, I will lost likely not be returning again."

0,"the attempt to upgrade this place from the dump of imperial palace it used to be seems to going OK.\n\ntheir cocktail waitresses are super nice and the staff is very friendly.\n\ni would never stay here but i do love the tables, always super cheap.\n\na better place than what imperial palace used to be, but still not a good option for accommodations on your trip unless you're looking for something super cheap!"
1,"LOVE LOVE LOVE X 1000.  This place lived up to all of our expectations and recommendations and I only wish I would have checked it out sooner.  We went on a crowded Saturday night with some friends and made sure to have reservations.  The staff was beyond nice and so friendly and the place was bananas packed.  \n\nThe food was superb.  I mean, seriously great.  I ordered the Scallops with a light brown sugar sauce and asaparagus on the side.  The Bf ordered the 8oz filet mignon and the twice baked potato side.  We each ordered 2 drinks a piece, which, I have to say Eddie V's makes a damn good dirty martini and their blue cheese stuffed olives are to DIE for.  \n\nThen dessert...oh sweet sweet dessert.  The bananas' foster was undeniabley the best dessert I have ever had.  It comes out flaming and the ice cream (we got vanilla, I detest butter pecan ice cream) was perfect to the warm goo-ey-ness of the cake which was a little carmel like...there are no words to explain how amazing this dessert was.\n\nAll in all with 4 drinks, an app, 2 meals, 2 accompaniements and dessert with tip for under $200..yhis place is a no brainer."
1,"I've often wondered what the ads meant when they say that Zumanity is created for adult guests. Sure, breasts, but what else? \n\nI found out that breasts, combined with acrobatic acts, humor, sexuality, audience participation, a fun host, two fun sidekicks, more breasts, and very strong drinks at the bar make for a great show. \n\nIt's not as circus-y as you might expect a CDS show to be. This show definitely leans towards the sexual side of things. You can see two topless women swim around in a giant fishbowl together down at the local dive joint on college nights, but CDS takes that and adds not only acrobatics but a sensual vibe to it. Not a single bad seat in the house. \n\nMake sure you are comfortable with sexual themes, acts, and nudity. \n\nAlso, breasts."
0,"My wife and I went there on Friday afternoon for a late lunch. We were looking forward to trying a restaurant that was new to our neighborhood, with outdoor seating. When we sat down, there were only 4 tables being used. We thought this would mean we wouldn't have to wait long for lunch. We were WRONG! We waited for 15 minutes to get service. It took 25 minutes for them to deliever  2 hamburgers that we paid 12.00 a piece for. The hamburgers were good. They add an additonal 3.00 for a side that, we thought was part of the meal. They didn't tell us there was an extra charge for the side.The menu has a limited selection for entrees. The service was terrrible. It was our first and last experience"
0,"And the award for the saltiest chicken curry on the planet goes to...\n\nNo, really. I must have had a bag of salt in that chicken curry with my $5.75 lunch special. The one that strangely comes with sweet and sour chicken, rice, and egg drop soup.  Honestly, the quality wasn't terrible - but seriously. Salt city. Maybe it's MSG. Who knows! However, service was very quick. Food was out in no time. For the price, it isn't bad I suppose. Certainly wouldn't be my choice unless it was my only one. It's also fun to say you ate at Jacky Chan's."
0,"I went to this place a couple times and took some new friends there today. However the service was unacceptable and we were asked to leave BEFORE we finish our food. The owner(older male) stated that he need to turn the table, but we could not withstand this type of treatment being there for merely 15 mins. This is quite upsetting as I thought the food was great. However, i do not recommend this place as the food just can't offset by the type of degrading treatment.   I will never go back."
0,"Service is awful. When we arrived there were plenty of tables.  By the time we were FINALLY able to leave, many of the tables were filled and EVERYONE was waiting for either food, more drinks or their check.\n\nThe food was so-so. Certainly not worth a special trip.  The beer menu is minimal and the drafts are overpriced.  We never did get the drinks we ordered.\n\nTook us two hours to wait for our food, then wait for our check, then wait for the server to run our cards.\n\nThere are many other local restaurants with quality food and much better service - I would not recommend Fran's to any of my friends."
1,The joy we had bringing our daughter into this world was amplified by having Dr. Wareing see us through it. I can't recommend her enough.
1,"It's a small area, but big, beautiful sights to be seen. \n\nIt changes so there is high replay value and between this and the Fountains you can spend a few hours doing something FREE and satisfying.\n\n For those into photography, this makes for great practice area. For those who just love taking family photos, this is a great photo op. I will say though that during the day it can get rather crowded so sometimes it'll be a wait before you can get your turn and have a clear shot, but most people are considerate enough to hold walking through if they see you are trying to capture a photo. You get a lot of nice natural sunlight through the glass ceiling, but if you don't mind night shots, it sometimes is very quiet depending on the setup. To me, the Chinese Year Year ones always look great at night whereas the spring one is best daytime. \n\nIf you want to see all of the seasonal gardens, this is the schedule: \n\n2013 Exhibit Calendar\nChinese New Year | Jan 12 - Mar 3\nSpring Celebration | Mar 9 - May 11\nSummer Garden Party | May 19 - Sep 8\nAutumn Harvest | Sep 14 - Nov 30\nWinter Holiday | Dec 6 - Jan 5, 2014\n\nBetween 5-6pm there are live musical performances from the Victorian Gazebo as well. If you're a flora nerd, apparently they do a Q&A with  Mr. & Ms. Green Thumb between 10:30am-11:30am. I would be interested to ask questions, but that is hella early for me! \n\nI'm always excited to see what they come up with. Sometimes animals and people are involved in the exhibit. My favorite was a rustic country springtime one with a a greenhouse full of butterflies.  If you notice the gaps in the dates. I came once while they were transitioning and it was partially closed off/unfinished areas.\n\nTourist and locals come here and spend a day in Vegas finery without blowing a lot of cash! I come for the fountain show, the gardens and get a treat at Jean Philippe and realize half the day as gone by.\n\n(Yelp 100 Challenge 37/100)"
0,"Great food, meh service.  There's less than a handful of places that treat you different when you ask for house water (or \""water\"" for the rest of us).  This is definitely one of them.  The food Lamb Special Pizza, Mussels and Apple Salad were great.  It reminded me of our neighborhood BJ restaurant.  But we were so fed up trying to find our absentee waiter we just left the payment and left."
0,"I had never been to this range, so I called and asked for directions. I drove 30 minutes to find out that I hadn't been informed when I called that you can only use  short distance clubs. There is also no mention at their website. Ridiculous! They are too cheap to put up nets, unlike every other driving range in the world.\nStay on 15th and head over to Encanto Driving range, where you are allowed to use every club in your bag."
0,"The steaks we had were good if a bit overpriced. I've had a better baked potato at Outback steakhouse (and yes, you can tell the difference between a baked potato and a boiled potato!). Our waiter was awful! He had no people skills and was almost rushing us through the meal ( really dude, its a Monday night, and half the place is empty). The saving graces for this place were: the caramel apple martini (absolute yumminess!, and the hostess (her name was Helen) who was very nice over the phone when I made reservations and when we got to the restaurant. She also spoke to us on our way out. She embodied customer service, which can sometimes be hard to find on the strip. Thank you Helen! I think I would have rather saved the $150 we shelled out on this place, and eaten elsewhere!"
1,I really enjoyed staying at the SLS. \n\nPros and enjoyment: \nCenter bar in the casino. Sherri and Christian are fantastic bartenders. \n\nCasino was clean. Dealers were so nice!\n\nBeds are insanely comfortable and the shower head was amazing. (Rain head) \n\nThe vibe of the pool is very mellow. Loved that. \n\nCons:\nLiFE- the nightclub there. Got harassed by the bouncers two nights in a row trying to get in. They were extremely rude. The club isn't worth the trouble. Go somewhere else. \n\nThe pool waitresses. Don't waste your time just go to the bar. The bartenders at the pool are attentive and fast. Even if I tired waving down a waitress I just got ignored.
1,very good..   huge plates!!
0,"For the all hype this places gets, it sure didn't live up to it. Sure, it was busy- what place isn't on a Friday night in Wisconsin. Rail drinks were prices right- two drinks for $6.00. I ordered the lake perch- what a DISAPPOINTMENT. If you've been to Door County/eastern WI and had perch there, don't bother with Tobys perch. It was not good. My cottage cheese was warm, and my date's \""salad\"" was lettuce with salad dressing plopped on it. No veggies, croutons- nothing. The server was nice enough, for bring so overwhelmed and busy."
1,Last meal in Vegas before flying home. Fabulous food and outstanding service. The goat cheese fundido was scrumptious as an appetizer. I had grilled mahi mahi which was very flavorful and had a spicy twist. I love spicy so it was right up my alley. Wife had smoked shrimp tacos which were excellent as well. If in Vegas this is a must meal!
0,"I thought I was lucky to get tickets to Cher's show but well, my review will be quite mixed.  \n#1 - she didn't really sing that much, maybe 5 or 6 songs max\n#2 - the audience watched the big screen a ton\n#3 - we watched dancers, acrobats, and the band\n#4 - there were lots of costume changes, in between 2 - 3 minute songs.\n\nTwo full song: Believe, and If I Could Turn Back Time.  All others are medley's and 2 min short or reprise version. I have to say, I enjoyed watching the band play more than watching Cher.  Oh, and since this was the last night of her show in Vegas, it was also fun watching fully dressed impersonators all over the place.  :)  Otherwise, it was not worth all the $$$ we paid for.\n\nShe needs to sing and/or perform more. I could have watched videos and paid less."
1,I can always count on World Harvest having whatever I need to make a special meal. Knowledgeable staff make great recommendations and know their merchandise.
0,"I heard so many great things about it, I stopped once with my family to find that they only took cash but didn't have an ATM in the lobby. So I went back when I was on my way to school to grab something and got a seriously bad stomach ache. \n\nVery disappointed"
0,"O M G. I need to update this one fur-shure. It had been a few month's since having something from here. What the heck happened? \n\nI soooooo *proudly* wrote the very first review for this place and have been recommending them since. I too went the first time based on a recommendation. NOT anymore due to our last takeout order. \nTo be nice: It. Was. Bad. \n\nFour of us placed an order. The chicken enchiladas were diced up pieces of dried out chicken, rolled up in dried out tortillas, with a thick glob of cheap ass cheese, covered with the salsa rojo(so the menu says) which in reality, was canned hunts tomato sauce with some black pepper tossed in for good measure.Seriously, it was so obvious when I opened the container and \""that canned sauce smell\"" slapped me in the face. My friend who ordered the very same thing, claims to have been slapped twice. \n\nThe beef fajitas were a takeout dish full of peppers and onions (where's da beef ? Oh there it is, pointing to about four slivers hiding under the P&O's ) we asked for corn tortillas and searching through the takeout for them I said \""Oh who ordered papusas\"" NO ONE did! Those things, that were as thick as a papusas, were the corn tortillas for the fajitas. No thank you. \n\nGood thing we ordered back up tacos. They're always good. \nWRONG. Again, back to the *dried out * theme. Where's the garbage?\n\nEven the salsas, green and the red, WAYYYY off. \nI know places have their \""OFF NIGHTS \"" but damn. \n\nOne thing that has not changed, unfortunately, is the use of little plastic baggies for the condiments on the takeout orders."
1,"Hands down, the best sushi in Pittsburgh, and actually the best sushi I have had period.  TJ, the chef, is amazing and super passionate about the food.  Do yourself a favor and sit at the bar and get the Omakase, where the chef just prepares for you based on whats fresh, you will leave totally stuffed and so satisfied.  Not only is the food amazing, but the people that work there are great and tons of fun. Have a sense of humor and bring yourself plenty of wine and sake to go with your meal.  Don't miss the late night service on Fridays and Saturdays.  I usually eat here at least once a week, sometimes, if Im lucky, two!  Truly a hidden gem in Pittsburgh."
0,"The food is great, but their service is terrible. I've gotten less than accommodating service the two times that I've been here. \n\nThis time on a Monday morning we arrive 15 minutes before breakfast ends, they say we have to wait 15 minutes to be seated for lunch to start, and mind you there are plenty of tables. They only took about 7 min to seat us, but they werent serving breakfast anymore. I came for some breakfast food, not an expensive sandwich. And breakfast is supposedly served from 7-11. Not 7-10:45.\n\nAnd a side note, they should open the darn patio seating. It's completely shaded and there's still another month or so before it gets too hot out."
1,"The name of this establishment has changed--it is no longer the Mt. Horeb Mustard Museum, but is now the National Mustard Museum, since they have moved out of Mt. Horeb and into Middleton, WI.   A lot more space in the new location (yes, I've been there more than once), the usual goofy stuff (mustard documentary, faux press releases, old advertising and mustard jars from around the world), and really nice people make this a great place to stop.\n\nTry their maple peppercorn mustard--it's delicious on brats."
0,Buying tickets is easy which was nice. However when we tried to buy a hot dog and a orange icee.  Hot dogs that are advertised everywhere are not cooking it's a 10 to 15 minute wait and the icee machine is broken. So keep that in mind while paying the  obscene movie prices. Theaters are a bit old but nice enough. I think I will look for a different theater even if it's a longer drive. This is the second time with no cooked food and drink issues. not worth the Hassel and pissed off family.
1,"I am having a tough time rating places, because when I am reading reviews I am looking for a place in the 4 to 5 stars range. However, when  I review I feel like 5 stars is the best EVER. I am changing, my 5 stars is now...I can not wait to go back! Harrie's is a perfect example.  The food was great, the service wonderful, the place was clean. The egg and sausage bagelwich is superb. My wife had the lox sandwich and while it was expensive, it took both of to finish it. We are already planning our next trip. Another, place that I am glad that it is not in my neighborhood, or I would eat there too much!"
0,"Appetizers came with our dinner which of course shouldn't. Cornbread & catfish nuggets appetizer were really good though. After all the raving my coworkers did, I expected better"
1,"Two amazing discoveries: Best Banana Nut Muffin ever AND our waitress DONNA!!!\n\nGreat family \""Diner\"""
1,"This place is amazing for happy hours.  I highly recommend the chicken sliders..  The vegetable spring rolls my friend ordered looked unappetizing, but he cleaned the plate right up.\n\nI didn't order any alcohol here, but I was able to try every iced tea they had there which were all pretty decent.  The drinks looked pretty good there too."
1,"This place was formerly known as, \""The Junction\"" and has recently been changed to \""Five Star Tavern\"". Anyway, been here twice already and figured I'd write a short review.\n\nThis place is definitely a lot bigger than it looks. Very spacious inside with a 360 bar with gambling machines on them. There are two pool tables on the western side of the venue right when you walk in. They look like they're in pretty good condition too. The times I've been here, they have been renovating and it keeps looking better and better everytime I go in here. It's a cool place to chill and watch some sports while drinking some cheap beer. You also get a complimentary drink if you're gambling which is quite nice.\nThe kitchen is not yet ready from what the bartender told me but will be open in about a week's time. I will definitely be back here. It's been kind of dead both times I've been but I expect that to change once the word gets out about this place. \n\nGripe 1: I wish they turned up the volume on the T.Vs whenever the game is playing because it's definitely too quiet in there sometimes. Plus I love it when I can hear the game(even if it's on low volume). \n\nGripe 2: No top or medium shelp liquor. No Crown, Jack, Ciroc, Patron, Don Julio. This actually made me really sad :(\n\nAll in all though, I can't complain too much about this place and I will be back! If I know I am going to go to a place more than just a couple times, then it's gotta qualify for at least 4 stars :D"
0,"Very dissapointed in our visit. Went on a Saturday night. The waiting area was very disorganized. The resturant is congested when busy and awkward getting around. They give you a small metal bowl with directions on how to fill it and then take it over to the grill guys. The line, which is like a buffet, was slow and awkward especailly getting the vegetables. If you have someone who doesn't know what they want in front of you, it holds up the whole line. They do have 2 lines (both were slow). \n\nBetween the people and the awful sounding loud music, it was hard to hear even sitting across the table. Service was a bit slow. And to top it off, my wife, who was wearing white pants, sat in some spilled soy sauce and stained the back of her pants. The waitress offered some napkins. The manager seemed like he didn't give a crap. Waitress should have wiped the seat after the last table.\n\nThe food was good, not fantastic, but good. The bowl didn't fill me but didn't want to go through that again so I didn't opt with the endless bowl. We basically served ourselves. There is really no need for any waitresses.\n\nGood luck!"
1,"I've only been here once but it was a good experience. Kind of a hit or miss with these TRIPLE D / Diners Drive ins and dives places. This didn't disappoint.\n\nWe went late on a Thursday night JUST for food for take out. We entered the separate dining area and then we placed our order. It's really tight like a hall way to get by but it has a handful of booths to sit at. \n\nThey have a \""typical pizzeria\"" menu. No offense at all, but the typical burgers, pizza, wings, ect. We were after the Stromboli! The menu was placed on the wall but they also have menus. After ordering we were nicely informed that the two Stromboli and wings would take about 20 minutes because of baking. No problem! Oh btw the place is definitely a bit \""dive-like\"". It isn't the most modern and definitely not all trendy and stuff. \n\nAlso you pay the bar tender just FYI. Kind of weird but makes sense to me. \n\nAfter that a couple of servers tried to seat us so we just sat down and waited. There's also this really friendly lady kind of roaming to make sure people are being helped and doing okay. \n\nAfter about 15 minutes the cook walked to our table to let us know the food was ready.\n\nThe Stromboli were 12.99, I believe, each. The wings were 8 for $10.00 I believe. \n\nWe paid, took it to go, and then we were nicely thanked as we left.\n\nIt was a standard and nice interaction done with smiles and that definitely went a long way for me. I appreciated the overall friendliness. \n\nWe got back to the house and dug in. I didn't read the whole get marinara thing until after I got home. Fortunately the Stromboli were still amazing without the extra sauce. The dough was what made it for me. Definitely different than a calzone. We got the original which was like typical three meat pizza ingredients and then a beef and cheese one. Both of the choices were spot on. Each is about the size of HALF of a pizza but they are stuffed. They both fit in one pizza box. The wings looked unassuming and standard but were nicely done. They were not breaded and slightly crisp. They were good but nothing to rave about. \n\nI honestly don't have any complaints. The only tiny minor gripe is that the end pieces virtually had no toppings stuffed into it. The dough was so good I didn't mind too much.\n\nI'll definitely be back for some Stromboli."
1,"This is my second time coming to Q Bistro and Damon took great care of us. He was constantly checking up on us and it made the visit a lot better. We ordered my favorite the spicy rice cakes, kimbap, the chicken wings and a bunch of other entries that were super delicious. Not only was the service and food great but the atmosphere of the restaurant nice as well. Last but not least the  restrooms are beautiful!!! When the restrooms are clean and pretty you know the place's a keeper."
0,My daughter loves the salad but we are not going to bring her to get it any more. Every single time I bring her we are rushed in line and receive the WORST customer service. I am also gluten sensitive and when I asked for gluten free options no options were available. I was told that maybe the grilled chicken is ok... just not good enough. Fail on customer service. Fail on gluten free.
1,"Perfect when you're craving something sweet and warm. Not a lot of seating, but it's rarely too busy. The cinnamon ice cream is the best and the sugar waffles are amazing. Warning: twice now I've tried to share - be ye not so foolish! You'll definitely want your own."
1,There was no wait. Friendly staff. Came in for a steroid shot for a bad case of allergy rashes. Highly recommended.
0,"Okay, I know this is just an IHOP, so I shouldn't expect culinary excellence.  \n\nBut.\n\nWe've been to this location a couple times.  They do breakfast VERY well.  Their coffee is always fresh and hot.  Their pancakes are always fresh and hot.  Their orange juice is never too tart, never too sweet.  I've never found foreign items in my food.  Wait staff is always courteous and helpful.\n\nBut.\n\nBeware - when you order NON-breakfast items, you may not end up with a satisfying meal.  This past weekend I took my daughter and my grandmother to the IHOP for a quick & cheap post-church lunch.  My grandmother ordered coffee and a belgian waffle - she said it was very delicious.  My daughter got the baby cakes kids meal, and she ate most of it.  I made the mistake of ordering the chicken fried steak with mashed potatoes and corn on the side.  The chicken fried steak was so tough as to be inedible (I took a couple bites and left the rest).  The mashed potatoes had clearly been in that serving bowl since the morning.  I took one bite and when I realized I was eating aged potatoes, I left the rest.  The corn was the best thing on the plate.  Needless to say when we got home I made myself a sandwich since I didn't really get lunch at the IHOP. *lol*\n\nAs I said, we've been to this location before, and they definitely do breakfast right (which makes sense given what an IHOP is).  My daughter and grandmother were very satisfied with their meals.  But stick with the breakfast menu.  Don't venture anywhere near the non-breakfast menu.  Then you should be fine."
1,"Many Sunday nights you could find me hanging at the Artifice for the live Jazz music available from local musicians. The bar is spacious and roomy with a lot of comfortable standing room both near the entertainment or around the corner on more plush seating. Many of your favorite drinks will be available but I couldn't tell you what most of them are as I stick to 'snakebites', 'black-velvet's'  and Jameson :) \n\nIt's a cool vibe and with all the commotion on the Strip, it's awesome to get away and enjoy some local musicians doing their thing in a quality space. Even if you don't make it for a Sunday night jam session, do yourself a favor and hit the bar up some evening. Dimly lit on the inside, the building is situated on the corner of First street in the Arts District of downtown Las Vegas with a bright neon sign. \n\nCasual and fun, but refined in it's styling, it's a bar that I get comfortable at and let loose whilst sipping on beers and jammin out to the tunes. See you there!"
0,"I wasnt gonna do this review because I dont really like to do negative reviews, but that's what Yelp is all about. \n   I went to Sushi Q for lunch the day before I left Phoenix. A small place on the side of a strip mall. When we first walked in I noticed the place had a smell.  \""Ooooh that smell, can't you smell that smell, Ooooh that smell\"" not a good smell, a smell that's like someone hurled last week and no one cleaned it up. Or like the carpet smells at some dive bars or low end strip bars have. I never did get pass it the whole time I was there.\nThe server was kinda not nice. You know when they make you feel like they don't care if you eat there or not.  Like your inconveniencing them. That's the feeling I got from her. \nOk to the food. They have \""all you can eat\"" for like $23.95 per person. It was 3 of us, and I can't eat seafood, so that was not for me. After looking it over, the \""happy hour\"" menu was the best deal. I had the teriyaki chicken bowl with rice, and vegetable tempura. The tempura was flavorful, but the teri chicken was just ok, at best. My daughter and son in law had about 7 or 8 different rolls, and according to them, they were ok. \nI can't see myself giving more than a 3 for the food, but when I add that \""smell\"" the place had, it quickly drops to a 1.\nSushi Q really need to spend some cash and replace that carpet, because just cleaning it won't cut it. \nFOR REAL!!!!"
0,"Do not order for delivery!! \n\nI don't know if they are just experimenting with delivery service or what, but the driver couldn't find our house right nearby. we called (after it had been an hour wait at 630pm) and asked what happened to our pizza.  spoke to a manager \""Jeff\"" and he seemed indifferent and not interested when I asked to cancel the order and get a refund.  \n\nvery poor customer service compared to other restaurants.  it's too bad because they have decent pizza, just make sure to eat there or get takeout."
0,"awful, got a beef taquito, and it did not look like beef and had a funny taste and smell."
0,"While the food was good it was disturbing to find an ANT in my drink!  All the restaurants I have ever had an issue of some sort a manager came and apologized, here I got no response at all.  I wasn't looking for a free meal just some concern about the ant that somehow got into my drink."
1,I have only gone for the lunch buffet and I must say it is pretty good. All the servers are nice not great but nice. This is my go to Indian joint when I am craving Indian. Definitely give it a try.
1,The brisket sandwich is mouth-wateringly delicious and I love their hot sauce selection!
0,"I must say I am very disappointed with the way it's establishment is ran, we had a group of kids (7) some with experience and some not, then they put 3 adults In the adult kart and ran all over the kids and ran almost 36 sec faster, not a safe experience for the younger kids."
0,"RACIST! Against white people or possibly just everyone except black people, I wouldn't go here if I were you, unless you're black and you love terrible food.  Asians, Latin-Hispanic, Native, anything else, steer clear!\n\nSince I've lived in Vegas I've had problems with finding good food, off the strip, that I don't have to shell out hundreds for.  This means that sometimes I go to a chain restaurant, which generally, I prefer not to do.\n\nAlso, I've never before accused an entire establishment of being racist, nor have I ever asked for any part of my meal to be comped until this visit to Applebee's.\n\nIf you are of European descent, I wouldn't recommend going here.  If you are a college student and your writing a paper on experiencing racism, this may be a good place to do some research, if you're white.\n\nAMBIANCE: 2 It's just Applebee's, casually comfortable except for that feeling that if it weren't illegal, you'd be the victim of a hate crime.\n\nSERVICE: Sh*t show.  I hope the f*ck better than they make food, serve food, bus dishes, and manage restaurants.\n\nFOOD: Not sure if this qualifies as food.\n\nLet me elaborate.  I'm a white, female, only parent, to a half Latin, adorable, little, six year old, girl.\n\nOn my daughters birthday I brought her to Applebee's b/c my daughter always wanted to have the staff at a restaurant sing to her on her birthday.  It was a busy evening in May.  I worked all day and was exhausted, so at this point, I was tired, and soft spoken, but totally patient, and reasonably friendly, as you should be to the people who handle your food.\n\nA couple came in behind us, with a child.  They're African-American.  They were seated in the booth directly across from us.  Also, all of the staff that we worked with that evening were African-American.\n\nWithin two minutes of being seated we had decided on our drink and food orders.  Our server came to take our drink order and I informed her it was my daughters birthday.  Then 15 minutes later she showed back up with drinks.  We made our food order and shortly after that the family in the booth across from us were being served their food.  We waited for about another 30 minutes and then they brought our food.  About this time the family across from us were getting their bill and getting ready to leave.  \n\nI ordered a steak.  It was totally disgusting.  It was so greasy my whole plate was like a pool of grease mixed with a little blood.  Every time I cut into the steak more grease would come running out.  Also, it was strangely seasoned.  It was like they took my steak and dipped it in the gutter of the grill, where they sweep all the extra grease and debris off the grill, in between cooking each item.  It was too gross to eat. If I would've eaten it, I'm pretty sure I would've needed emergency gall bladder surgery that night.\n\nMy daughter ordered the grilled cheese.  There is not a grilled cheese this child won't eat!  Except the one from Applebee's on this particular night.  She said it was gross.  I told her to just wait to have them sing \""Happy Birthday\"" to her, and then we would go.  While we were waiting my daughter needed to use the restroom.  We went to the restroom and when we got back our table had been completely cleared.  The busser was still there.  I looked at her.  We had even left my daughters backpack at the table so it wouldn't appear as though we'd left.  The busser asked if we wanted our food back?  No Thank you!  Then the waitress brought our check.  I told her our food was terrible and we didn't want to pay for it.  She checked and came back and said she could only remove the charge for my daughters meal, $5.  That still left a $20 balance for my steak and a beer.  I told her I didn't mind paying for the beer, after all I did drink it, but that I wasn't going to pay for the food.  The manager came over and aksed what he could do.  I told him I didn't want to pay for the inedible food I didn't eat.  He said he couldn't refund it so I paid the bill and left.  I also reminded them that they forgot to sing to my daughter. They asked, after we paid, if we still wanted them to, we both just wanted to leave.\n\nI called the restaurant when we got home and told the manager that if he didn't refund my bill I would go to the manager over him and tell them about our experience.  He said he would gladly give us a meal credit to come back.  I was like \""you're kidding, right?\"".  He said If I wanted to take the weekend to think about it, we could come back in the next few days and eat free.  We passed.  He agreed to refund our balance to my debit card, which he NEVER did.\n\nGo to Outback Steakhouse, it's just down the street and the service and food are way better."
1,Very clean tanning salon.  They keep the towels in the back so don't forget to grab one before you start your session.  Friendly employees and great stand-up beds....never a wait.
0,"Nothing outstanding here. Portions are a good size. Lots of variety to choice from. Staff doesn't seem to leave behind the counter. There's a small salsa bar but nothing to fuss about. I've had the fish tacos which were a little bland. Same for the chicken burritos, not much flavor. Not sure why I expected this place to be good, bigger menu than del taco but not much on taste. If you're hungry and need a quick bite I guess it'll do."
0,Didn't get to try this place.  I ordered a personal pizza.  My tab was $5.40 (approx) and the owner said cash only or spend $7.00.  I explained I only brought my debit and he just shrugged.  I wont return!
1,"Went here for Thanksgiving and had a good time. They had all the normal Thanksgiving turkey with dressing, cranberry sauce, mashed potatoes and gravy, plus all the dinner buffet. I had some turkey then filled up with sushi and the bbq section. I like the selection here, it's not serious sit down quality but i think it is the best Asian buffet around the valley. I had clams, crab, seared tuna, bbq pork and beef, seaweed salad, marinated baby squid, fresh oysters, and a few others."
1,"I had my wedding reception here.... It was amazing but the only thing I had a problem with was the coordinator of my reception.... They had told me to fax credit card info to them 2 weeks prior to event to charge my credit card.... But they decided to wait until after the reception..... But didn't inform me of this..... So when they decided to charge my card..... It didn't go through... Obviously....& expected to be paid.... I told them a few home truths and stated I would not be paying until I had the money.... And how dare they  change something without asking the bride first.... Other than that it was perfect.... Perfect waiters, bar tenders, great food"
0,"U.S. National Whitewater Center\n5000 Whitewater Center Parkway\nCharlotte, NC  28214\n\nTo whom it may concern,\n\nI made an honest mistake this evening at the US National Whitewater Center, a business I've supported since its grand opening in 2006.  The manner in which the situation was handled left my wife and I stranded with two dogs, no way to get home, and cost hundreds of dollars to correct.  As a business owner who values their patrons, there is no way my customers would receive this kind of treatment. \n\nOn Thursday evenings there is a large turnout.  Tonight was no exception; the parking lots are full.  As you drive near front entrance there are people going back and forth to their cars with: kids, dogs, lawn chairs, church buses, taxis, etc entering the facility.  To the right of the main entrance there are a few parking areas in a dirt lot.  This is the area where I have parked my car for years.  When the area gets full people routinely park beside the roadway in the grass.  Tonight this is where I parked.   What I did not notice in the midst of the commotion upon entering was the addition of signage stating no parking past this point.   As we parked the car a USNWC employee was standing 15 feet away looking directly at me, who smiled as we gathered our two dogs and exited the car.  We then let the dogs visit a few trees, still a stone's throw from the employee and the car.  Upon leaving at 8:45pm I noticed the car was not there.   First thought was it had been stolen, then I saw the signs \""no parking, towing enforced\"".   I then wondered how many times I have parked there before with that sign glaring at me.\n\nThe front desk keeps tabs on cars they have towed, so it didn't take long to discover that was what happened.   They provided me with the towing company's information.   I've never been towed before, so I had no idea what to expect.   The conversation with the towing company was very disturbing. Yes, we have your car but we close in 15 minutes and if you aren't here before then, you cannot get it until tomorrow.   The USNWC isn't exactly bustling with taxis at this point in time, nor is it very close to anything.   A taxi was dispatched immediately, but who knows how long that takes.   I told the towing company I would call them back as soon as I was on my way.  Several employees from the USNWC were nearby and overheard how cumbersome all this had quickly become.  \n\nWhat now had to happen: get a cab for my wife and I plus two large dogs, get to the towing company in 15 minutes, have hundreds of dollars (cash only), provide proof of registration, proof of insurance, copy of driver's license.  Time was the biggest concern as there was just no way manage all this and have any hopes of getting my car back this evening.   I had never thought of it before, but taxi's are not pet friendly.   When it showed up, I took the taxi and my wife plus dogs stayed behind waiting for friends on the east side of Charlotte to pick them up.   By the time I arrived at the towing company, the owner agreed to have someone onsite, provided I met their requirements to retrieve my car.  Friends met me there with cash, I had my insurance card matching the VIN of the car, have my car keys, had paperwork in the car with my name and address on them.  With all this, plus me being frantic and stranded at the location they towed my car from: \""No can do without: title, bill of sale, or registration receipt\"".   Given I want all of these to be in a safe place, I do not keep them in the car.  Long story short, I'm not getting my car tonight and I will not make that business meeting at 8am across town.   Having said all that, I realize that I parked in a spot marked no parking. \n\nIn between realizing my car had been towed and the taxi showing up, I spoke to the manager of the USNWC about my situation.  I asked how long the no parking signage had been there.   He advised it was installed about one month ago.  There is little point in debating the merits of the circumstance at this point because the damage is done.  Nevertheless, I asked if they knew the policy was recently changed, would it be reasonable to put a sticky note on my window indicating the policy recently changed and you cannot park here anymore.  No answer.\n\nWhy did I write this in the first place?  For starters, I'm upset for not seeing the sign and for parking where I shouldn't have.   What upsets me more is a business I had a connection with for years let me down.   Respect for one's customers is what every business should strive for.  A simple warning sticky-note on the window, or a yell \""hey read that sign\"" would have made my day.  Instead I may never return to a place I have hung out with friends for years.  I hold no illusion my experience will affect business there one way or another.   More than anything I find it disrespectful.   I believe those actions give insight to the inner workings of the facility and how its customers are valued."
0,"I really liked staying at the Luxor until now. I recently stayed at the Luxor for two days and the room was dirty and it had been neglected cosmetically. The walls had dents, the wallpaper was tearing apart, the rug was sticky and to top it off the Luxor pen they provided us with had a chewed cap which they didn't replace after we called it in."
0,"Horrible food, literally the worst buffet I've ever been to. The drinks are good and so is the desert station... But not good enough to make up for how awful the food is. Hometown buffet is gourmet in comparison! We had several plates at the table that we're finally picked up as we were on our way out. I wouldnt even eat here again for free!"
0,"Went in there this morning. The lady spent barely 10 minutes on my hair...it was a disaster. I asked for a low faded and she shaved the whole side of my head with a 1. I don't care if it was a 13 haircut, I ended spending another 23 bucks getting it fixed at the barbershop/salon on the other side of the shopping center. (I should've went there first, but didn't know about it). But if you want a real haircut...don't go here. Paid $13 for an embarrassing haircut."
0,Not to impressed.  The dancers are very pushy and money hungry. I understand they are there to make money but to stand around talking shit about the other dancers and saying how they are better was a huge turn off. Felt like we were dealing with high school boys.  We left within 2 hours of being there.  I never thought I would say this but Chippendales was alot more fun.
1,"I don't get mad. I get even! I don't stay home. I vote! \n\n  I follow the news. Some elected officials are doing a commendable job. However, some of our elected officials or candidates following them have raised my blood pressure. Today I raised my voice through my vote. I was voting proud and voting early. \n\n Voting at the Early Polling Center in the Galleria is as easy as 1, 2, 3. Today when I opened my mailbox, I see the Clark County Elections booklet. The thing was that my left foot was hurting and with urgency I needed to buy sneakers. But should I visit the Las Vegas Outlet Mall or Galleria Mall? Tadah! The the sample election book led me to the Galleria Mall where I'd play a role in my Country's future. I'd park my vehicle by Dillard's then walk a few feet to the Kohl's area. \n\n The polls were not crowded today. Immediately the Election staff greeted me. I inquired if I was registered to vote. I did not fill out paperwork this year. I was 100% ready to vote. Elections are truly keeping up with technology. I say this because by scanning the back of my sample ballot booklet, she retrieved my name and address. Quicker than I could walk from the table to Kohl's, she presented me with the conputerized card I'd place in the ballot box, and directed me to a man holding the American flag. He'd direct me to another worker holding the American flag at the ballot box where I'd cast my vote. \n\n  The times are a changing. Gone is the dull booths where voters pressed these annoying levers. Today it is all computerized and really more in the open. The ballot box has revolutionized to the ballot touch screen. Being a fan of Caveman Keno and the smartphone, voting was fun. Corresponding to each vote was the choice of candidates that a touch on the screen would cast a vote for. Toward the end, it would prompt you to review your votes. You'd touch a submit button prior to making your way toward the poll worker at the exit (by Kohl's) who thanked you for voting and gave you an \""I voted\"" pin. \n\n  Voting is so important. You live once and need commendable leadership under strong and moral leaders. I walked out of here with the feeling that I made my voice known and possibly in one or two instances I joined the majority in telling a couple of candidates, \""Your fired!\"" And in a few instances I joined the majority in telling a few candidates, \""Job well done.\"" The last thing I want to say before I walk out of this review is, \""Every vote counts.\"""
1,"I will never have anyone else do my nails! I have moved away from Cave Creek, but still drive 25 minutes to have Tam at Spazzi Nails do my acrylics. I had always gone to American techs and my nails separated and often got \""green\"". So every two weeks I was nipped to death. Since going to Tam I have never had one problem and my nails look beautiful.  \nSpazzi is a family business and they work by appointment only. Tien and Tam are kind, gentle, and very professional. The shop is very clean and nicely appointed. You will probably have Tien if you go for a pedicure. She is fabulous (but so is Tam). They provide spa chairs, pleasant music, and a most satisfying massage. \nBook your appointment today."
0,"Worst hamburger I have ever tried to eat.  Salad was below mediocre.  Eggs were overdone.  Bacon omelet had no bacon, just bacon bits out of a jar.  Waitress just okay.  Managers/owners seem to be the problem.  Neither owner smiled once upon our arrival, during meal or upon our departure.  Never going back.  Should have picked up something at Earth Fare grocery (next door) and taken it home.  Really bad experience."
1,"I have a new found love for Indian food and when I found myself in Madison I had to check this place out. It was most excellently delicious! The staff was very nice and the price for 3 people including 4 drinks and an appetizer was about $75. If you ever find yourself on the East side of Madison, you should really check this place out."
0,"Service was really poor and the food was uneventful. Fries are overly greasy, and my soup tasted like salsa heated up with chicken added."
1,"i love Sprouts. Plain and simple. They have the best pricing on essential oils out of anywhere I've seen, their produce is never lacking or over priced, and the staff is always friendly and knowledgeable. I was looking for Epsom salt while i was in there, and the girl told me their distributor was out for some reason. the only Epsom salt they had was in a tiny pint sized carton for $2.99. Anyone who has ever bought Epsom salt knows that outrageous. She apologized to me like 3 different times for the store being out, which obviously was in no way her fault. I wanted to hug her she was so sweet. I still walked out of Sprouts spending $60 on a cart FULL of produce and i was happy as can be, even without my salt. Sprouts will forever be my grocery store of choice."
0,"This was the first place we ate at while moving to Cave Creek. We were in our home the night before the movers were set to deliver our things - and we were hungry. We called in an order for carry out about 30 minutes before closing - we didn't anticipate It would take long for this food to be cooked. The staff on the phone did not do a good job hiding their upset. My husband headed out and during this time got lost finding the location and made it right at closing time. He picked up the food and was again treated to a bad attitude.\n\nThe food was nothing to write home about. No dipping sauces were provided/offered, things were messily thrown in the box and the taste was average. I get upset when places mentally close before they are closed.\n\nWe haven't returned in 6 months of living here and have no plans to do so."
0,"I'm a big Starbucks drinker so I was super excited when I found out how close this one was to us! However, to my disappointment this has been the only Starbucks that does not hold up to par. Every time I have gone my drink has been messed up. Even simple drinks such as a hot green tea. So sadly to say we won't be going to this Starbucks any more."
0,"We arrived at 8:20 for the all you can eat shrimp. When we approached the hostess, she informed us that she would seat us, but they are closing the dining room and we'd be the last customers. I'm unsure why this was relevant, it only made me feel like an inconvenience and that she was doing us a favor. My son got the shrimp those were good. These rest of our meals were awful. I got the roast beef sandwich and it was so greasy I couldn't pick it up, the bun fell apart on the bottom. The Mac and cheese was not much above kraft. The pasta was way over cooked. I was going to give 2 stars until we sat and waited 20 minutes after we were done eating for someone to address we needed the check. After we received our food we did not see anyone until that point, once the 3 of us had to stare down the staff to get attention."
1,"Pretty easy trail but you have to pay a vehicle fee to get in.  The view isn't as great as some of the other peaks closer to Phoenix, but it's nice to avoid the crowds once in a while."
0,"If I could travel back in time 30 minutes, I would just so I could punch myself in the face for opting to try this place.\n\nFor starters, this is NOT a coffee shop.  While they are trying to angel themselves as such, they fail in that attempt.  Their failure really isn't any surprise, as the coffee menu was very limited and the girl behind the counter clearly wasn't a barista.  \n\nI ordered a latte, for lack of my normal (seemingly generic) mocha being on the menu.  After 10 minutes, I finally got it only to have it taste like what I assume old engine oil tastes like.\n\nThey also fail at being a bakery.  I don't want to be too harsh, but if I wanted a Fry's croissant, I'd go to Fry's.  They have a very limited bakery selection with their display having little more than a few cookies.\n\nI will give them credit that their prices are cheap.  I also give the girl behind the counter credit.  She was having to wear 4 hats at once.  She worked hard and was very nice.  And they do have a lot of space.  But I really can't see myself going back, which is sad because there aren't a lot of independent coffee shops in this part of Chandler."
1,"Wow. Stupid good. Amazing burger/sliders and buffalo sammy. Truffle fries and ask for garlic aioli and dont miss the garlic chili wings... each one as big as your arm.  Come here now. Only negative is... hmmm no real negatives. Improvements: serve wedge on bigger plate. Blue cheese with wings instead of ran\nch. Pretty good when that is the worst I had. To top it off... nothing left to go, that good. Deliver to my house. We WILL be back. Brian rocks too!"
1,I really enjoyed the cupcakes from Mad Hatter since they opened. Unfortunately they decided to double the prices and as much as I like the cupcakes I rather spend my money on something else. They now charge $26 for a dozen mini-cupcakes and the previous price was $15. They lost a loyal (Chubby) customer.
0,"Oh puh-leaze!  The good reviews must be written about excellent headliners or by shills.  Got supposedly \""free\"" tickets that cost the three of us $40.  They included one watered down drink each.  Yes, even my bottled water (that is clearly labeled $4) cost $10.50, plus a $2.50 upcharge, plus tax, plus whatever else it took to get to the $40.  The MC was horrible, and I never heard so many genitalia jokes in a 60 minute period before from three different comics.  If you go, take lots of money and buy lots of drinks because the only people laughing were drunk, drunk, drunk.  The venue is very mediocre and, as might be expected in Vegas, you have to walk through the casino to get to it.  Showtickets4locals sure was a rip off on this occasion.  Never used them before and never will again."
1,"Pasta Tella is a great restaurant, to begin.\n\nThe food is exquisite. I've had good filet of sole, but they take the cake. It was buttery, it was crispy, it was soft, it was firm. It melted in my mouth. The price is very reasonable. At around $25-30 CAD per person, and the food they serve, the price is really good. While there are a great deal of many restaurants in this area, Pasta Tella is a place I will return to when I am back in Montreal."
1,"The pizza was good, the service was good, the decor a little plain.  I enjoyed the pizza, it was a thick, tasty, pizza.  The sauce was sweet, the cheese was heaped on, and the crust was perfectly cooked.   I would go again."
0,"We went here for dinner on a Friday night. It was fairly busy. I ordered Chicken Marsala. I'm not sure what I got. The pasta and sauce were cold and the mushrooms were completely uncooked. The chicken was hot but stringy. I also ordered a glass of wine and when check came she charged for a higher priced glass. That irks me to no end.  Husband got Chicken Parm. He liked the chicken. His pasta and sauce were also cold, the sauce bitter. The bread and wine were really good. Usually wine by the glass is not so great. Waitress was nice. We used to eat here all the time and it was really good. About a year ago we got a terrible meal and this was our first and last time back."
0,"~ 4 months later: \n\nStill have yet to step inside a Best Buy. \nI did file a complaint with their corporate office, but obviously not a single soul gives a damn and I have yet to be contacted about their awful employees. \n\nI can only hope they go the same way as Circuit City"
1,Who cares if it's not a bar?  It's good!  I love getting Fat Tuesday's and walking randomly around the Strip.  I usually hit up the one in the Planet Hollywood Miracle Mile Mall.  Walking around with Fat Tuesday's in a shopping mall makes me feel so classy.  \n\nGet a few extra 151 shots to your octane and then expect to have a good night.  The jello shots aren't bad either...
1,Amazing!!!! Robert returned calls quickly and managed our expectations on his arrival time! Our furniture and rug looks great!!! He took  extreme care and time with each piece!  We also had our vents done! We are extremely happy  with the results and his professionalism! Highly recommend Robert!!!

0,"I want to share the real deal about this salon, I am not discouraging any one,  you should try it and see how you like the work and treatment. I have been going to NAIL SPA for many, many, many years before KC became the new owner and her Brother owned it at the time. I was actually very happy with KC who always took care of me for a very long time, years and years. Her work was always good and always loved the treatment. I would usually spend a good amnt of $$$$ there and always sent her business. What changed, well to this day I am not so sure, but she started moving me to other techs which was fine they did good work, but my appointments were always booked with her... if by accident I messed up a nail and would ask her to fix it she would get mad, very bothered and would get short with me. I understand she has a business to run and has other clients to focus on, but honestly her attitude started bothering me. One time I got 3d nail work done when she started working with it, well pretty much all of them fell off and when I came back to show her she again got upset, scoffed and said \""just sit down, I am busy right now.\"" Another time I brought a polish from home granted it was a new polish, when they applied the top coat to it the polish kept bubbuling up, the tech would show her and they kept trying to fix it and fix it... to the point that I lost count as to how many coats of polish and top coats I had on all nails. I told her that it really was not working out if I could change the polish or if they were to busy (which it was'nt) that I could come in the next day. She scoffed and said, well you brought this polish and you go home and you will like it in a few hours. Sure enough  my hubby said you don't look happy with it... it honestly does not look good. I went to her the next day and asked if they could please change the polish, she scoffed and said well some one else will help you I have an appointment comin in. I waited and waited and her appointment never showed, after 30 min she came up to me and said just sit down and fine I will take care of it. I told her I would pay since it seemed to bother her so much, she no dont worry about it just sit down. It was really uncomfortable. I finally put thought into it and called her one day to schedule another appointment, she said I dont have time for you, you have to go to another tech I said that was fine then she started getting a bit rude (I know you may think may be its me, she was on speaker in the car and my hubby looked at me and mouthed go some where else) I asked KC at that time that I had been feeling uncomfortable, was there an issue or does she may be not want my business? She said no thats not it, do you want an appointment or not? I told her no, and thank you for her time and that I would no longer be returning as her client. \n\nSevering this business relationship with her was the best thing that I could decide on after I would always spend $130 to $150 dollars each visit, and always felt guilty of spending that amount on a shop that honestly did not care for me or my business. I could only take it personal, because I would see her treat other clients with a bubbly and happy persona, and she woulde be the complete oposite with me. Honestly the work is between ok, not great and she has some new remodeling in the salon which helps, but her attitude and treatment stinks and I would honestly say don't bother."
0,"Wow. Bad.  Didn't even stay and order.  So excited for them to open and so totally disappointed in the interior and the menu. Ugh.  Hey people, this is North Scottsdale, not a college campus."
0,"I ate here on my birthday when we did a group trip to Vegas. We got in late, and didn't know where to go and ended up choosing this because the baby they use to advertise was everywhere in the hotel.\n\nI've had a lot better tasting Chinese food and paid a lot less for it. The Moo Shu Pork was pretty good, but all of the other dishes we got were either too salty or too bland. They forgot about one of the dishes we ordered and didn't bring it until 20 minutes after the first plates arrived. We also had trouble getting refills on anything. This was by far the worst service I've ever gotten in Vegas\n\nI will definitely not be eating here again on any of my trips to Vegas."
0,They have average prices on suppliments. You are better off to order on bodybuilding.com for a better price. I noticed a lot of their stuff was more expensive than even gnc.
1,"When in Vegas, pass by this bar! Great beer choices. Too bad they dropped the preset \""4 course meals\"", now you can assemble your own \""flight\"" of 4 tasting glasses. Our waiter was great and took the time to find the perfect matches together with us."
1,"The food is good, the beer selection can't be beat, and they have a great happy hour 3-6pm. But the service is generally awful, but I am giving 5 stars still because it's a bar, and they have tv's and alcohol to keep you busy while you wait for service. \n\nIf this was a family restaurant and the service was sub par I wouldn't go. But to me the beer selection and happy hour deals compensate enough for the service  \n\nHappy hour is $5 for any draft, and they have like 50 to choose from"
0,I ordered a cheese and sausage omelet. I got a plate of melted cheese with sausage and egg on top. This place is overpriced and not worth it.
1,"My wifey/roomie is a baller with the Rio and its affiliates so me and my Joy Luck Club Crew rolled through Diamond status stylez.... \n\nThe suite was very nice, and I could say it is a notch below my current fave, Venetian in terms of room size and noise level. We were on the 18th floor though so that may make a difference. \n\nThe casino is a bit smokey for my taste, but the ammenities and service were great. The buffet is pretty good, plus we got in quick with diamond status. Voodoo, the club upstairs was small, but the rooftop was tight!! Too bad there was a seriously cold wind frenzy that night, but we chilled anyways. \n\nPeople were mixed and chill compared to the upscale clubs on the strip. I would probably go here before the \""hot spots\"" because unless you are top model status and like to wait around for a long as time to get denied, this will fulfill you dancing spirit's thirst!"
1,"Beautiful inside and out. Everyone seems to congregate on the top floor where the Marquee entrance is, but I didn't have any issues finding an open seat for my boyfriend and I when we walked down to the next level. Don't get me wrong - it's still crowded, but it's well worth searching for a seat. \n\nThe drinks are pretty sweet - which is okay since I'm into that but service is pretty slow. We paid cash and it took about 30 minutes for us to see our change. Plus all the girls are dressed pretty trashy for this establishment.\n\nFor me, it was a nice place to chill for a few hours after dinner. And while it does get really crowded, it didn't feel like I was in the middle of other people's conversations. It still felt pretty intimate because of the way they do the seating inside."
1,"Absolutely LOVE Nail Haven!  My girlfriend and I visit monthly for our pedicures.  They have an awesome membership plan for $15 a month and you get a free pedicure, plus 10% off any other services.  They are the BEST pedicures with hot rocks and everything.  They take their time as well.  I don't know about you, but when I'm getting a pedicure, I want to relax, and I love that they don't rush you through it.  I really don't understand why there is such a negative review on here, but I guess everyone has different experiences.  The staff is great and they all know us when we come in, even if it's been a month.  It's very nice and clean inside and doesn't smell as strongly of nail chemicals as most places.  Love this place!"
1,Good food for a good price. Owner and his wife are very friendly as well as the rest of the staff. Cheaper version Qdoba/chipotle. The buffalo chicken burrito is really good.
0,"Three of us visited DB's on a Tuesday afternoon. I get that is not optimum prime-time but we wanted to play some pong and remembered there were a couple places to do so on the strip.\nKinda tough to find, this place is tucked away in the shops by Planet Hollywood Casino. \n\nIt was pretty dead (expected for the time) and our bartender was ok though I could tell she was annoyed by the prospect of customers during the afternoon. We got cups & balls ($5) and a pitcher of their beer special, Sierra Nevada ($12 -- nice price!). Pitchers range from $10-$17.\n\nThere are about 6 or 7 tables inside and they are all pretty beat up. Most were kinda sticky-dirty and could have used a wipe-down. I was pretty grossed out anytime the ball went on the floor since it was so filthy. Our pong water cups were yellowish-brown in no time. \n\nThe bathrooms were atrocious. Out of TP in all but 1 stall, no soap AT ALL and just overall grody. If you aren't refilling soap and TP during the dead afternoon hours, then when are you?!\n\nWe stuck around for a couple games and bounced. Besides the decent price for the pitcher compared to beer prices on the rest of the strip, there was nothing here I was into."
0,"I was def expecting more out of this place. The service was amazing though - so attentive and friendly. The food on the other hand was pretty bleh.  I won't go back because all i could think about was eating something, ANYTHING other than what i was eating. My hunny said his sandwich was basic and was pretty underwhelmed."
1,"My wife and I liked the casual outdoors atmosphere. We were seated and waited on by Wyatt, who was warm, engaging and helpful. We never had to guess where he was or when our drinks or food would show up. \n\nI had the chicken pot pie special and it was very good, with a nice flaky crust. My wife had the southern fired chicken salad and liked that too. The house-made potato chips and potato bacon soup were very good also.\n\nThe prices were fair and when we're back in town, would definitely consider a return visit."
1,Went in to check on the sizes of a storage unit and the lady was super helpful.  Really nice and accommodating and really tried to make it very convenient for me as far as location.  Explained all of the charges and benefits and even suggested their promotion that I was unaware of. Super easy and very happy to be working with them.
1,This place is really great! Super close to where I live. They have different products than most vape places (brand wise). Awesome juices! I bought a really cool cartomizer there too! I would totally recommend this place. Check it out!
0,"I'm going to write one last review on FastMed, as if the two previous ones weren't clear enough. Yes, I had an incredibly horrible experience there...fine, lesson learned. I found the PA's behavior reprehensible and I now know not to walk foot in that place again. I took all the right steps to make them aware of my experience there, I emailed Dr. Williams, who is the Founder, President & CEO of FastMed. He did reply and said he would look into the issue and apologized for the bad experience. He then sent another email saying he forwarded my complaint to the Medical Director in Az and said I would be contacted shortly, that was 11 days ago,I have not been contacted. I also called my insurance company and filed a complaint with them and was advised to also file a complaint with the Medical Board of Az. I am not looking to get the PA fired, which I know wouldn't happen, nor am I trying to smear her name...I just want her to realize that each patient is an individual. I know Urgent Care is exactly what it claims to be, it's a fast solution to a medical problem after hours. I wasn't expecting her to take the same exact care my family doctor does, but I was expecting her to clearly look at my history, examine the issue, ask questions  and of course advise me accordingly. She failed to do so in a professional manner and just to be a complete and utter jerk she throws insults at me in front of my 2 children. Whatever her issue was with me, right or wrong, her bedside manner was disgusting and I will never forget that day I was treated like scum at FastMed Urgent Care."
1,"(Arguably) the best coffee in town. Artisan Roast provides coffee for many different cafes and restaurants around the city. So, coming here, is coming directly to the big cheese. \n\nI have come here several times, and yes, I really love the coffee. But I also always takeaway from here. There aren't as many seats here as the original store on Broughton st, but there's the same clientele (hippies like coffee, apparently.)\n\nIt seems quite strange to not have a proper counter to takeaway from. I am so used to standing to wait for a takeaway that I feel strange being told to have a seat while they're preparing my drink, but maybe it's just me?\n\nOverall though, It's a great spot and I'm glad I have this place as a morning coffee option! I come here quite frequently! \n\nOh, and p.s there's a punch card for this place! Get your 9th or 10th free."
0,"After training I rolled in here with a little packet of almonds to replenish my valuable protein. Some struggly ass gutter bug tried to deprive me of my nuts. Not in an apologetic way but in an entitled, condescending way. Come on. This is the kind of service I'd expect at a passport office or MacDonald's.\n\nThis is my last time giving money to Beertown. Down with Beertown. I want to amass enough wealth to buy this franchise and shut it down.\n\nDo yourself a favour and try out Abe Erb next door. The service sucks there too but at least it comes with a smile."
1,"Yep, I had a salad for lunch today. A nice manly, Southwest Chicken Caesar salad. I threw the girls at this new Paradise Bakery location a curveball and ordered the large with two chocolate chip cookies to go. They hit it out of the park. My plastic salad container was filled to the max. Plus it had tons of spicy, chipotle caesar dressing. Just the way I like it."
0,"I would say this place is equivalent to Carrows.  Ok, the last time I went to Carrows was over 10 years ago but it compares to what I remember it being.  The service is slow and our server was so clueless and didn't have any common sense.  For example, my friend ordered a cup of soup and asked for it to come out at the same time as her entree.  The server responded saying \""The soup will come out about 2 minutes before your entree because it won't fit on my tray\"".  Uhhhh, yeah, we understand that food for 9 people won't hit the table EXACTLY at the same time.  Just bring the food and soup around the same time!!  Annoying.  Anyways, as the meal went on, the service didn't improve but it was okay because most of us were tired and semi hung over so we weren't in a hurry to get anywhere.  Their breakfast foods are typical.  Egg white scramble was ok, the lox and bagels could have been better and fresher, their sausages had a really weird consistency, the huevos rancheros looked good but the person that got it barely touched, not because she was hung over but because it tasted horrible, the tomato bisque tasted like marina sauce.  Typical cafe food but fine if you're feeling sluggish and you want to eat something without getting dolled up."
1,"This is the best ice cream place I've been to. The ice cream is so creamy. The flavors are great, too. My favorite is chocolate birthday cake batter. They make it there from their own dairy farm, Superstition Farms. They also have random flavors that they create like Lays potato chip. You can try all the flavors!"
1,"I went to Maizie's last night, after downloading the Yelp App for my iPhone.  I was stunned at the quality of the food and the outstanding service.  Our server knew the menu, knew how to treat customers and had some great recommendations for us to try.  I got the Blue Burger, and it had the Blue Cheese stuffed inside the patty.  Yum.  And the fries were perfect.  Not the pre-made bag fries, but fresh cut with the skin on and deep fried to perfection (not soggy).  After settling the tab, we walked out and one of the staff (not our waitress) even poked her head out the door and said thanks and goodbye.  That's excellent customer service in my book.\n\nThere was only one thing wrong, and this goes for a large number of restaurants, bring me the bottle of ketchup (catsup), not some tiny little dipping cup.  I hate when, you're in the middle of your meal and you have to wait for a server to fetch you another ketchup (catsup).\n\nWe will be back to try some of the other menu items, that's a promise."
1,"I have taken this tour two different times. Some parts of it seem a little dated, mostly the dialogue in the beginning video, but the facts are still very interesting and the tour is amazing because of the structures. I would recommend this tour to anyone that is not claustrophobic because at one point in the tour, you take an elevator to the lower levels and it can be a bit much for people with those sensitivities."
1,"My engine light was on and all I could think of was $$$ to fix my German. I always go to the dealer when something's going on with my car. So, I took my car to the dealer and they wanted \""around $6,000 because we need to do...\"" I stopped listening to the whole schpill but the guy's mouth kept moving. I asked for my key back and looked for another place that can fix my car. Then, my service guy tells me they can do a price match. Really? All of a sudden you can do a price match? Ninja, puh-leez!\n\nI called German Motors and spoke to this man with an East Coast accent, Ramon. When I got there, there's this Filipino-Italian guy with a Boston accent in this dark old office with magazines from at least a year ago. Ramon was so pleasant and friendly. I told him I was going on a trip so I had to leave my car with them for a few days. They gave me a ride to Fashion Show Mall which is right across the street.\n\nRamon kept me on the loop with my car's status. He called me everyday and the day I was going to pick up my car, I was running late and they were closing but Ramon waited until I got there. I ended up paying around $600 vs the dealer's around $6,000!"
0,"My experience mirrors that of Roy R.'s, leading me to think Tender has a beef (no pun intended) against people getting married. \nI was part of a bachelorette party of 9 and we chose this place so that we could dress up and have a fancy meal.  It looked promising.\nDecor: dark lighting, dark wood everywhere, both of which are nice.  I felt like I was in the dining hall of someone's mansion.  We were seated in a semi-private room that had two long tables that could each hold 10 people.  \nFood: we were there on a Sunday and the majority of us chose the $39 prix-fixe menu which offered a good value: choice of soup or salad as a starter; choice of salmon, organic chicken or six ounce filet of beef as an entree; choice of cheesecake, creme brulee or flourless chocolate cake for dessert.  A glass of wine could be added for $15.  I had the salad which was quite tasty.  I had a sip of the mushroom soup--it was very mushroomy to the point of tasting almost like a seafood soup.  The beef filet was indeed very tender, but lacking in flavor.  I had to douse it in the peppercorn sauce that accompanied it.  The side order of mushrooms were delicious, as were the potato fingerlings.  The creme brulee was delicious.  \nService: TERRIBLE.  Especially considering this place is supposed to be four or five star dining.  First, after we were seated, a server named Chuck came out and introduced himself as our server and asked us what we would like for drinks.  Then he went away.  Five minutes later, someone named Ezekiel (\""Easy\"") came out and introduced himself as our server.  What happened to Chuck?  Usually servers announce a shift change; they did so earlier at the buffet we were at.  Then as Ezekiel was taking down our order, he made a tasteless joke towards the bride-to-be (will not elaborate).  \nWhen Ezekiel brought the drinks over, he brought two of us the wrong drinks and there was a few minutes of delay until the correct ones were brought out.  \nAt one point after the entrees were served, I excused myself to the use the restroom and when I came back, 8 of the 9 dishes were cleared, including my 1/4 finished filet.  The servers were in the process of putting the unfinished side dishes into styrofoam leftover containers.  I asked if they had put my 4 ounces of steak in a doggie bag, and Ezekiel acted surprised.  \""Nobody told me you were not finished.\""  Um, Easy, it's YOUR job to ask if I was done with my meal and given how much was left, it should've been a no-brainer!  He kept saying he didn't know and that nobody told him.  I was about to throw a fit, but 1) this is supposed to be a happy occasion and 2) we were pressed for time.  \nWhen Ezekiel brought out the desserts, I got the cheesecake even though I ordered a creme brulee and had to wait a few minutes for the correct order.  Admittedly, the drink and dessert flubs are minor, but completely not expected at a 4 or 5 star dining establishment.  \nTaking away someone's unfinished entree is unacceptable at any establishment.  When that happened at California Pizza Kitchen, I got a voucher for a free appetizer for the next visit.  Here, he knew he messed up royally but did nothing to make amends.  \nI would wholeheartedly recommend against going to Tender."

1,"Staff is very friendly and polite. ( best in the west shopping center ) Not shure why people think prices are high, when I was there they had on a 75% off chairs so normally a high end leather desk chair that cost somewhere $300 I got for 2 something also a desk for 69$ !! plus tax I can't argue with those prices for new for that matter. There is no delivery charge to my area however if I want it assembled it would of cost an extra $60.00 and I am shure prices change. But overall very happy greeted when I came in the door and staff new what to do. Will be back  for those inquiring on price it ranges from moderate to pricey on items however thats every where if you want something more affordable I suggest craiglist."
1,"For our birthdays, my parents treated me and my husband out to Famous Dave's. Our waitress, Brenda, was really good and friendly and I could have sworn she'd been a waiter for a long time but she told us that it was her first week. Nevertheless, she knew the entire menu and answered my mom's questions about the garbage can platter. \n\nLet me say that the ribs are seriously meaty!!! About an inch thick from the bone. I love all the choices in the barbeque sauces. Their coleslaw is super creamy (I don't think it has onions in it, hey, not everyone can eat onions). The pork and beans were warm and not from a can. Afterwards, they brought out ice cream for us on account of our birthdays and the cool part is they bring it out with a sparkling Roman candle on the plate; it's quite a sight. \n\nOnly dinged them one star for a few MINOR reasons. The platter is just too much meat. It's almost nothing BUT meat. It'd be great if they mixed it up and replaced those huge chicken breasts with more of those carrot sticks (we only got two for four people), and maybe with onion rings or mustard potato salad. The corn muffins are NOT good at all. They taste like cardboard. \n\nOn a quick note, the little drawing that the waitress is forced to draw on the plate is useless. It's trivial and the plate just takes up more room on an already cramped table."
1,"I went here for lunch with my bf. If you bike here or walk, they give a 20% discount or something. Check in on foursquare and use your amex card for 5$ off.\n\n It was a casual afternoon. I had the trout and he had the happy hour fish and chips. Our food was delicious. I think the only thing I had a bit of complaint was I felt a bit rushed. However, the food and drinks are amazing. The fish and chips were fresh and so crispy. The trout dish had green beans and peanuts. I ordered mash as a side too. Fish was seasoned perfectly and green beans were crunchy not soggy. \n\n Overall,  I had a great experience and will return!"
0,"Terrible Service, the food was overpriced for what you get.  The squid salad was dry and lacked flavor, the Eel sauce needed more flavor, the rice wasn't sticky enough. The Fish is fresh.  But I don't think I would not return.  I prefer the The Sushi Room because there is more flavor in their rolls and salads and the rolls are bigger."
1,"I have had dinner and lunch at Nobuo, and everything has been phenomenal.  Since I've not had a single dish here that wasn't excellent, I'll just let you all know about some of my favorites.  \n\nFor lunch, the Pork Belly Buns are a great choice.  Off their summer veg menu, the squash blossoms are terrific, and the watermelon with goat cheese is a good way to finish a light lunch.\n\nOff the dinner menu, Tako and Tomato (tender, grilled octopus) is a favorite, and Grapefruit & Hamachi (also available at lunch) is everything you would ever want in a bite of sashimi.  And the Coconut Curry Lamb is one of the best lamb chops I've ever had."
0,Sucks you have to give 1 star. Don't waste your money. It was dead when myself and 2 friends walked in. Machines are tight as hell. I ordered wings. Got 8 wings for $8.95 no no no don't wait your money!!!! I lost $80 on the machine and still have a $20 tap. BS !!!! My friend got charged for his soda when he was playing too. Not drinking alcohol at all!! Don't don't don't waste your money!!!!!!
1,"I was introduced to this place by my little sister that lives in vegas. Thank you little sis! This place is great! great pho and it's open 24/7!! how awesome is that? Service is somewhat pretty fast. We were in vegas last weekend and we went to this place twice! good hang over food! trust me! Prices is decent, good food =)"
0,"I would put NO STARS or negative 5 stars if I could!  People here are RUDE!!  Called to inquire about a grill and was on hold for a while, not the problem, when a lady finally answered the call, I told her I was calling to see if they have a certain product I was looking for... Her response..., \""what?, I don't know?  Hold on.\""  Then she hung up on me!  I called back, to try it again, a man answers, said, \""ummm, hold on.\""  Then hung up on me again!  So, nevermind, will look elsewhere!"
0,"I had eaten here two years ago, and remember it being really good.  I sat at the bar, the bartender was spot-on, and the food was excellent.\n\nWent back this last weekend, and was underwhelmed.  The staff was friendly, helpful, and on-point, which was very much noticed and appreciated.  But the food itself seemed to really lack.\n\nI had the Jamaican Curry bowl, which is the last item on the vegetarian menu.  It tasted overspiced; not too spicy, but just as if someone had put in three times the spices the dish called for.  I can't imagine the chef who made this tasted it and liked it.\n\nMy girlfriend got the salmon, which was a really good-sized portion, but it could probably have been fresher.  We split an appetizer that was pretty good, and each had one drink.\n\nThe music was great, actually.  There's a wall of speakers above the front row of tables, but it's turned to a background volume, which led to the music being clear, well balanced, and unobtrusive.  The decor was good, and I especially liked the custom trussing of lights over the bar.  \n\nAnyways, after tax and tip, the entrees should have wowed the hell out of me, and they really failed to do so.  I had wanted to go try the vegetarian prix fixe, but I'll probably hold off on that for awhile.  I'll eventually head back, as I do remember having a great meal there, but at $85 for the two entrees, two drinks, and an appetizer, I'm not in a hurry to check it out again."
1,"Waited to review until all the freshness had worn off. Great experience - except for parking.. but this whole area is horrific for parking. Awesome, cocktails had the Moscow mule ala Joyride -- yummy... ... really great and unique food."
0,dirty hotel inside n out.  Many people walking around outside n hanging around.  Less than a quarter of a roll of tp when we arrived and WE KILLED 4 COCKROACHES!!!  never again will we stay here!
1,"A very well-managed apartment complex. The apartments themselves are very nice (get a second story apartment with vaulted ceilings, if you can). The office staff are very courteous and professional. \n\nMy only complaint is that parking is limited to one spot per unit (without the option to rent additional spaces), and there is very little conveniently located \""open\"" parking, which can make things a little difficult when guests come over.\n\nOn balance, it's a great place to live!"
0,"Double D's kicked a guy out of the bar for kissing his boyfriend. Avoid this hate ridden establishment. There are plenty of other fine bars in lawrenceville for you to spend your money. Clearly the owners and staff of Double D's doesn't value \""ALL\"" of their customers."
0,"Decided to try this place today since it was new in the neighborhood....It was terrible!  I ordered the chicken avocado wrap and I personally do not eat avocado or carrots so I asked for it without avocados or carrots. As I was walking out of the store I looked around and noticed that two of the what I have to assume owners cars were parked directly in front of the restaurant taking up guest parking including a spot that isn't even parking. When I got home sat down to eat and opened my food up I was totally disappointed, they got my order wrong, I was hungry so I started to eat around what I didn't like the chicken was dry and had very little flavor. So I gave the other half of my wrap to my husband who isn't picky at all and he didn't even like it. I definitely will not go back! Not to mention I paid $13 for the wrap and a soda...which is wayyyyy to pricey for the quality."
0,"after having seen almost all the cirque du soleil shows, im not too impressed w/ Le Reve. It seems like Dragone took a more artsy approach w/ this show to differentiate from his previous Cirque shows (which i think are much much better). \n\nThe stage and the lighting are the best things about the show. The stage is a circle and the audience encircles the stage, so there isnt a bad seat in the house. And the stage is so complex: certain parts raise and lower so the water level in the stage changes throughout the show. and when the different colored lights hit the water, its really pretty.\n\nAs for the show itself, the acrobatics have all been done before and much better too. There were no \""Oh my God, please don't fall/break your neck!\"" moments that make these shows so exciting. Unlike Cirque, the music is in English and it sounds like its sung by a drunk Michael Buble. \n\nGo see Mystere or O, or even Ka before this one. If you do see the show, don't pay full price. You can get good prices at discount ticket stands. I got discount tix at the stand in Circus Circus Hotel. All the tix stands sell diff. shows. Tix were around $80, much cheaper than the list price!\n\n*oh yea, if you're bald, they'll pick on you during the preshow :), so if youre shy wear a cap!*"
1,"This little place saved my life every morning I was in Vegas!  With no coffee makers in the rooms at the Palazzo- this was a quick jaunt down the elevators to the 2nd level to get my daily caffeine fix.\n\nA couple of large, black ,drip coffees will cost you about $8 bucks (Yowza!  Wish I was more ambitious as I'd head to McDonald's) but still better than the hour and half room service time quote and heaven only knows that that would have cost!"
0,"Just figured Id update everyone on \""The Whiskey\"" as I used to work there.  Just after the first of the year Station Casinos bought The Whiskey and pretty much fired all the employees and replaced us with hotel staff and then ran the place into the ground.  Now I may be a touch on the bitter side as I loved my job and loved working there, but much of the atmosphere that everyone loved about this club was fueled by the fun loving and high energy staff. At any rate GVR has made other plans for the space the club occupied and have since close The Whiskey for good.  Not exactly sure what will be replacing it but I doubt it will live up to the reputation The Whiskey had made for itself over the years.   R.I.P. Whiskey....  We'll miss you."
1,Nice customer service. Good product.
0,Worst Best Buy ever.\n\nI just had an employee there throw a temper tandrum because I asked him to call someone who has keys to the mobile locker over so I can buy my item.  Treating customers like crap just because someone asks if they can buy something?\n\nMethinks not.  Never again.  NEVER again.
0,"In my previous review, I made the argument for Charcos in how they avoided the dreaded \""drama plate\"". I ordered something interesting and it managed to taste great without any sort of micro-management.\n\nAlas, I must step down a few paces from my previous praise, because the drama has creeped back in. What used to be gourmet chicken on a budget is now a roll of the dice.\n\nThe confidence from my first visit seems gone. Employees seem confused; not sure whether to charge up front or when the food is done. Or what goes on a particular sandwich. The wait time has doubled. The \""wraps\"" sometimes use burger buns instead of pitas. The fries sometimes come without that seasoning that worked so well. It's like a roll of the dice with your twenty dollar bill on the line.\n\nWhere is that Charcos we were first enthralled with? I hope it comes back soon, because I'm not sure it's worth being burned a third or fourth time by something on the production line."
1,Half off of pizzas on Monday. They also have an app that tells you what beers they currently have on draught. Justin is an excellent bartender who can recommend a beer...or two.  They also have an excellent salmon burger.
0,"Same experience as Drew P. For some unknown reason they shipped my prescriptions to an address that had NEVER been associated with me. In fact, I had never even lived in that state? \""Customer Service\"" was no help, and didn't care. Told me to \""contact the post office and straighten it out.\"" These idiots are now Express Scripts, but its the same incompetent idiots, just under a new moniker. I have REPEATEDLY told them not to send child proof caps and I just now received my latest refills. Yep, child proof caps. So here's what's going to happen. I am NOT paying the invoice for the medications. I am NOT using this \""service\"" ever again. I am going to use my insurance card at retail pharmacies. My co-pay is a little more, but guess what. Cigna is going to have to pay LOTS more! And when they ask. I'll let them know exactly why."
0,I love Flame Broiler. But this one is a bit harder to enjoy. Food was not as good as I usually get. But my biggest beef was the music - it was so loud that it was hard to hear the woman behind the counter as I was ordering. I said the music was really loud. She just smiled at me. Maybe she couldn't hear me? \n\nI may return but won't eat in again.
1,"Best place I have found in a while! Fresh ingredients and so many amazing flavors! Everything is amazing, love eggplant!"
1,"Wonderful place to stay for 2 days!! You can also connect to other hotels! Staying here is at a reasonable price too and not expensive at all right on the Las Vegas strip, which is easy access to every place you can think of!"
0,"Place is cluttered and disorganized, kind of dark too. The owner is a strange fellow. I was just looking around one day when he and some other customers were going off on some kids for not being Christian, you could tell they were really uncomfortable. I'm glad he didn't drag me into that conversation. Last I circled this was a comic book store, not a church. I won't be returning either, seems like everything gets picked over by his box customers and were left with the scraps."
0,"I'm not here to review the Old Port as a tourist attraction. As a spot to visit, the Old Port is great. It's bustling in the summer, quaint in the winter. Things get a bit pricey, but you can go for the charm, it's free! And who can resist a labyrinth, regardless of the cost?\n\nInstead, I'd like to review a function of the Old Port that folks often forget about, the fact that it is also a show venue. Les Quais du Viex-Port is a section of the Old Port that sometimes gets turned into a concert stage. This might be great for summer events and free shows. However, I'm not so convinced about how it gets converted into an entrance-fee venue. I saw Bj\u00f6rk perform there a couple of years ago, and it was fantastic, but let's face it, that's because it was Bj\u00f6rk. Aside from the musical component, the \""venue\"" is just a flat gravel surface surrounded by a makeshift fence. Not exactly ideal ambiance for more intimate gigs. I decided to write this review because I'll be seeing Portishead play at les Quais du Vieux-Port in October. While I'm thrilled about the show, as the trip-hop defining band have not been here since 1998, I'm not so thrilled about the venue. Add to that the fact that it's an outdoor show in October in Montreal? I'll pray that the music gods look kindly on us and spare us the rain or temperatures hovering around Zero. Portishead will put cartoon stars and hearts in my eyes. Les Quais du Vieux-Port, not so much."
1,"It's $5 for pizza lunch buffet. I'm not expecting spectacular pizza. It's edible and the fact that they will custom a pizza for you, now that's great!! Nothing at cici's lunch buffet is extraordinary, but it's good. And for what you pay, can't best it. You'll come in hungry and leave stuffed. Dont like the selection, ask then to make you a pizza with the toppings you want. It's that easy. There's always something for you."
0,"We went there expecting to have a good Father's Day meal..We got our drinks and we told the server we were ready and he walked away and it was literally a good 12 minutes before he came back to take our order. I guess the table next to us was angry with him so he came back with an attitude towards then we find out most of the dishes we wanted were 86'd. We waited another 35 mins for our food..no exaggeration. We were very disappointed, the server was very rude and avoided us a lot. I understand having a bad shift or having guests treat you bad but don't take it out on the guests that are actually nice to you. Definitely won't be back."
1,"1-888-NEON LIGHTS\nWow is all I can say when I walked into our suite. Yes, at $99 per night we got a 1 bedroom suite, complete with a washer and dryer, dishes, spices, and a huge tub & shower. ON MEMORIAL DAY WEEKEND! Actually, every day of the year it is always $99 - and so much better than a majority of the strip hotels I've stayed at. There are granite counter tops, tile floors, balconies with furniture, a beautiful pool & jacuzzi area (so nice to see all those fabulous Las Vegas party bodies out there!) and the front desk staff will do anything you ask. It is also located within a few block of the best place for breakfast in Las Vegas (Blueberry Hill) and right down the street from the best of the new strip. The couch in the living room is fabulously comfortable and sits in front of a great flat screen TV with cable (so does the bedroom). One thing you will notice at once is there is no stale disgusting odors like there are in the strip hotels (like smoke), the linens are beautiful and clean and smell good (down comforters!), not like bleach and smoke! Also, the water pressure and faucet head in the shower will allow you to enjoy a nice shower. There is plenty of lighting in the room, even in the little corners. \n\nI can't say enough good things about this place. All suites is no joke. We even got a chance to do our laundry in our room before we left so there was no dirty laundry to do upon our return or packed in our bags with the clean laundry. \n\nPerfect!"
0,"Decent food, but service was terrible. Our server didn't ask what choices we wanted with our dishes, didn't try to upsell us any salads, and spent a total of 10 seconds at our table of 7 people after taking our orders. \n\nOne of the orders was completely wrong (onion and mushroom burger, no cheese; came with no mushrooms or onions, but plenty of cheese) and when we sent it back with a clear explanation, it came back wrong again.\n\nThe waitress came back to refill water only once or twice throughout the course of the meal, and was quick to return to other tables (ones that didn't have an automatic 20% gratuity built in because they had fewer than 6 people). She was rude, uppity and clearly thought she had better things to do. \n\nTruly disappointing for a setting and building of this caliber. The view is outstanding, and out on the deck having drinks and eating stuffed olives would have earned Verrado Grille a 4 out of 5. Terrible service soured the entire experience.\n\n---\nUPDATE: 3/8/2011\n\nI'm pleased to report that the exec. chef from the restaurant read my review and sent me a very nice note. It's a good sign when a chef holds himself accountable for the restaurant as a whole and doesn't make excuses, so I'm reasonably certain our bad experience was a fluke. Next time we eat at VG I'm hoping poor service won't detract from the food, and I can re-rate it higher."
1,"Came here recently to purchase the Rosetta Stone software (separate review of that store).  I'm a fan of the Fashion Show Mall, here's why:\n\nPROS\n- Easy in/out.  The underground parking lot with the entrance across the street from the Trump Towers is a great spot to get into the middle of the mall easily.  With the exception of Christmas Shopping Season, I can get in/out with no issues.\n\n- Great stores.  Despite being on the higher end of the scale, this mall has some great stores.  Some of my favorites are Tommy Bahama, Zara, Front Row Sports, Dillard's, Nieman Marcus, Sak's 5th Ave.\n\n- Decent food.  There are some good food choices here.  Johnny Rockets, Maggiano's, and California Pizza Kitchen are a few of my favs.\n\nCONS\n- It's on the Strip.  That means it's not convenient to get there for a local.\n\nOverall, I like this mall a lot.\n\nWill I return?  Of course!"
1,"One of my favourite 'chores' or household 'tasks/duties' is grocery shopping. I love roaming the aisles looking at various items and contemplating my next meal. I can probably spend an entire Sunday afternoon grocery shopping. I like this Waitrose because for a grocery store in Edinburgh it's pretty big and it stocks nearly everything that I need. The have American food (hey Fluff!) as well as a good selection of Asian, Indian, and Tex-mex foods. They have fresh seafood and their meat is superb.  Their fresh fruit and veg is slightly more expensive than what you would pay at Tesco and Sainsbury's but I think it lasts longer and it's definitely a better quality.  The Waitrose essentials brand is pretty standard. Although there are things I don't skimp out on (ahem Heinz Ketchup). In this location they put their reduced items at the front near the pre-packaged and 'on the run' fridges. I've found some really excellent deals there! The fresh bread and croissants are really good good! They also have a really good cheese aisle. Further, I have found the staff to be exceptional and very helpful when I'm looking for specific items. Also, if you become a Waitrose member by joining online you'll routinely be sent emails for special offers and every time you show your card you'll get 10% off something (with different promotions). This location also has a pretty good beauty aisle - they sell my favourite shampoo and conditioner (Tommyguns). Even though I no longer live in Bruntsfield I still do some of my shopping here!"
0,"Unless you are having a birthday party- don't even try to visit this place on the weekend. I have tried to shop this store twice in the past couple of months and each time I go in- am shuffled to the side and not allowed to move as the bday party girls do a fashion show. Great for the bday kids, but not so great for innocent shopper trying to purchase a few items. If you're going to just do private parties then close the store. Owner seemed annoyed we even came in- and was very unhelpful. No thanks- will take my daughter and money elsewhere."
1,Tailgate platter when feeding kids and their friends. Always consistent anf better than feeding them nuggets.
1,"A good 'all-around' pet supply store.  The staff is friendly & fairly knowledgeable in their areas.  The store is clean and inviting, with a large selection for just about every pet, be they cat, dog, bird, etc.  They also have frequent specials throughout the whole store.  A great place to have nearby if you own pets."
0,"I'm giving Catch 22 all of one star, mainly because who I think might be the new owner/manager decided that the group I was there to watch football with this morning wasn't all that important enough for their business and he decided to talk down to one lady in our group because she was setting up a wireless tower to get sound and he thought she was doing it wrong.  Turned out to be bad wifi from Catch 22, however he couldn't admit it.  Furthermore, when I asked if we could have our game on the big screen he replied \""nope, that is not happening\"" and then gave me some BS excuse of how the wiring in the place is all connected and how certain tvs can't go to another channel without other tvs there going to the same channel.  Interesting how other sports bars can get it right, however they can't.  The tone of his answer to me couldn't have been more condescending.  And seriously, if we were told we get a separate place in the restaurant with our own tv then why should we have to bring our own sound to a sports bar???\n\nAt the end of the day, we were pretty much treated like second class patrons.  The food is somewhat ok at best, last week our group had lousy service, and whomever was in-charge of the place this morning was a real (rhymes with \""Rick\"") to us.  Never going back there again."
1,"A truly excellent experience all-around.\n\nThis Scottsdale outpost of the upscale chain features soft lighting, a jazzy soundtrack, and phenomenal food and service.\n\nA complimentary dish of local olives and almonds kicks off the meal, with a small, locally-sourced menu heavy on beef (with several chicken and fish options as well). No matter your choice, you will not be disappointed.\n\nI ordered the skirt steak, the slices of marinated beef cooked to a perfect medium rare and accented by the bright flavor of fresh arugula and meaty heirloom tomatoes. A wine list contained some formidable selections, with a few craft beers added in. Just as a fine cabernet sauvignon can compliment a steak, so can a bottle of North Coast Old Rasputin imperial stout.\n\nDessert selections were just as well-prepared and ranged from an assortment of house-made ice creams, a banana cream pie, and a decadently rich devil's food cake.\n\nWhile not flawless (the bread, much touted by the wait staff, arrived lukewarm and with just a dab of butter), it is as good a dining experience as you will find in Scottsdale."
0,"The Mission has been a favorite of mine since it opened.  I had my Farewell to Scottsdale, Arizona brunch on April 27th, and it was very disappointing.  After we were seated at 11 a.m.,  ordered drinks, and were given menus; the waitress advised us upon taking our order that their fryer was broken, and wouldn't be repaired anytime soon, or at least while we were dining.  Really problematic for our party, as we were looking forward to splitting their fabulous french fries.  There was a rather dismissive apology by the waitress, then she advised us that any of the entrees that would normally require a fryer could be prepared as grilled. I really couldn't think of what that was on the menu, but I ended up ordering a couple of \""safe\"" appetizers to split, and left disappointed. We also ordered chips and guacamole, and the chips were either from another establishment or yesterday's as they were stale and uninviting.  Not what you would want to pair with $12 tableside guac.   It was even more entertaining to watch the very large touristy family next to us who wandered in with 7 kids under the age of 12.  There was nada on the menu for these little ones to eat except a quesadilla I guess.  After they ordered, their waiter came back to their table to let them know that their whiny kids would be ordering something else besides french fries and empanadas.  Sort of a metaphor for me and Scottsdale as a whole, glad to be back in Cali."
0,"A few reviews got it right. This place is nothing special at all. Could be any second rate buffet anywhere. Dry, cardboard textured fish, wet, over-dressed salads, soggy pizza, and what I would consider a lack of choice. Oh, we also sat at a table surrounded by tables that had not been cleaned - dirty dished heaped around us. The value is there if your going to make 16 runs to the crab claw and shrimp table as most where doing with crab legs stacked 18 inches high on a plate. My advice - skip this place!"
1,"I booked a Hoover Dam Kayaking tour in late September ($237 for 2 people).  This included pick up from the hotel, a McDonalds breakfast, an Arbys sandwhich, and transportation back to the hotel.\n\nOur tour guide, Alex, arrived at 6am on the dot as promised in front of our hotel (MGM Grand).  He was very friendly and efficiently made his way to the other hotels to pick up our other kayakers. \n\nFrom there, we stopped at McDonalds where we ordered what we wanted and was paid for by the tour guide.  We ate the Mickey D's on the way there.  Once we got to our destination, the Hoover Dam, we drove down right to the base of it and got our Kayaks loaded into the water. \n\nWe pretty much paddled down 11 miles with about 4 or 5 stops in between to check out the sites, take a break, and have lunch.  The experience was made by the friendliness and knowledge of our tour guide Alex, who was always there to help and guide.  We hung out at a couple of hot springs and Alex had our lunch packed in his Kayak with some ice.\n\nI would recommend bringing water shoes on an excursion like this - you are getting in and out of the kayak a lot and stepping into the water as you get out.  \n\nAt the end of the trip, Alex loaded all of the Kayaks back on to the truck himself while we relaxed and he drove us back to our hotels.  He never once solicited a tip like I have been when I booked with another company.  Overall, I will definitely use this company again next time I am in Vegas and recommend it to others.  At the end of the day, as friendly as the guide was, he realized this was a business and his first priority was the customer and he never forgot that."
1,"Had dimsum here today, the usual siomai, hagao, spare ribs, chicken feet, sticky rice and veggie dimsum. All for $23.00 and we're very satisfied! Yum."
1,"If you want really good breakfast or brunch food this is definitely a hidden gem. You would never tell driving up to the front, but this place does it right. I believe Yoli does all of the cooking so when it gets busy, be prepared to be patient. They share an awesome courtyard with another new place called the Perch Brewery and they have a bunch of rescued exotic birds. Our daughters love to come to this place just to see the birds, but the real reason we keep going back is the food. The service is good as well, but don't forget you may have to wait for a table and then be patient for your food...it is well worth the wait!"
1,"It always seems that there has to be one spoil sport in the crowd.  When a person takes the time to write a 4 paragraph comment, and ends the last paragraph with, \""Don't get me wrong, I'm still going to stop by for a quick couple of slices now and then\"", you really have to sit back and scratch your head.  I guess some people are just poised for negativity.  When all you can do is make a valiant attempt to point out all the short comings that you think you have found, and then make the comment, \""I seriously don't get the love expressed in all these reviews, as I've never seen it\"", you must truly be a hater.  I love the wings at Mama Mia's; I have never got a soggy order of wings, they are always crispy and flavorful.  Sure they may have down sized the cup, but if you were a true groupie, you would remember that at one time there was only one size of cup, period.  Now, one has been down sized, but there is a choice of two cups, a large and a small.  Who cares if they down sized the cup, the drinks have free refills any way.  Oh, so you have to make a few more trips to the soda fountain to get more soda, big deal.  If you are getting it to go, drop a few more cents and get a large, it isn't that much more to spring for.  \n\nThe counter girls I think are great.  They are always sweet & kind and are very willing to help me with prompt and courteous service.  Yes, maybe at times it gets really busy and they can't give me their full attention, but that is business in a very popular and very busy pizzeria.  Very seldom do I go to Mama Mia's, and there isn't a wait or a line ahead of me.  I have been going to Mama Mia's since they opened in November of 2004.  I have always loved their pizzas, wings, and subs.  They have a slew of subs to choose from as well as many pasta dishes and calzones, all made fresh to order.  Yes some of the subs change as far as the specials are concerned.  Some come and some go to make room for new ones.  Then old subs come back and then they are gone again.  My favorite sub ever was Jays Caribbean Chicken Sub.  It was a short special, but I still loved it and if it comes back I will get it again.  It is what it is.\n\nMama Mia's is a great pizza restaurant that has been a neighborhood icon since 2004.  Even in the worst of economic times they never changed their prices and have stayed true to the game all the way.  You can still get 2 slices of pizza and a soda for $3.50, and you can't beat that anywhere.  So thank you Mama Mia's for being there to fulfill my pizza needs and desires whenever I get the urge.  Keep up the good work!!!"
1,Great small ambiance off the strip. Really good service.
1,"Very cool feel at The Players Club.  Love the food there -- especially recommend the sliders, which are absolutely terrific.  I went with a group of girls and we shared different cocktails off the menu. Creative, tasty and not too pricy!  We loved this place and will be back soon!  (Maybe tonight!!!)"
0,"i'm from california and did extensive research on food in the downtown area, even though i was only going to be here for a day. this place got good reviews, so i snuck in for happy hour before heading to the king's kitchen for dinner. basically, the only drinks on happy hour menu were a madras for $5 and miller lite for $3. um, not so cool. then i ordered the popcorn shrimp for an app. it looked delish when it came out. i even ate a couple and the sauces were yummy. even the people aitting next to me commented on how yummy it looked. then i saw a line of poop in one of the shrimp. a super gross out peeve of mine. i started to go through all the shrimp and they all had the poop. serving un-de-veined shrimp at such a fancy place?? uck!! i stopped eating. and left. will not return. BUT service was good."
1,"Sadly for my tummy, I was dining alone and didn't get to sample anyone else's food or over order. Happily, my burger was wonderful! I ordered the Farm burger that features duck bacon and a fried egg. \n\nBecause I'm picky about buns I'll start my review there. The bun had a great texture, not too soft, not dense, but substantial. It held up to all the tasty drippings of my medium well patty and the gooey yolk of the fried egg. The bun was visually appealing too, with both black and white sesame seeds. \n\nThe burger, itself, was cooked to a perfect medium and as I cut it in half the egg yolk oozed into the bun. The sharp cheddar complemented the other big flavors nicely. It didn't disappear into the background, but didn't take over either.\n\nThe size of the burger was also perfect. Anything larger would have been overkill. Would have loved to try the fries and the soba salad, but there just wasn't room."
1,"I LOVE YOU EARL OF SANDWICHES!!! My mouth is watering as I am writing this review, just remembering the taste of the sandwiches! I was in vegas last weekend and for that whole weekend, all I had was Earl's sandwiches! So far I tried The Tuna Melt, Earl's Club and Jerk Chicken sandwiches. ALL OH SO GOOD! My favorite I have to say was the Earl's Club. I totally want to try the other sandwiches when I come back, or better yet please make up in the bay area!!! I'd seriously come here everyday to eat. lol The wait was not that bad, and the workers there are extremely  friendly, even though i was probably drunk and obnoxious lol Sorry! Definitely a place yuo need to come visit if you are ever around in the area!"
0,As of right now terrible experience. wouldn't recommend it to anyone!
1,"Very happy with staying here, the lazy river is an added bonus though between running around the strip and seeing free shows, we didn't really have much time enjoy it thoroughly... \n\nthe LVB location is set further out from the strip to give you more of a resort type of experience. There are plenty of entertainment onsite, pool, jacuzi, lazy river, pool table, air hockey $1, DVD rentals ($3), foosball and several arcade games for kids..."
0,"My last visit to RM was one of the most unpleasant experiences I've had at a local venue. I brought a group of friends from out of town to grab some drinks. \n\nWe were greeted at the front door by an odor that smelled like raw sewage. To get away from it we migrated to the stage-end of the bar which was empty but the live music was obnoxiously loud. \n\nSo we continued to the unheated patio area where we were immediately greeted by two local transients who asked us for cigarettes. We don't smoke and told them so. We grabbed a table and were happy to be seated and clear of the hazards. \n\nRight then an RM staff member entered the patio area and politely asked the transient fellows to move on. They came to an agreement that if he provided them both with cigarettes, they would leave. Guess who the Staff member came over to ask? Seriously. We said no again.\n\nA waiter then came out and took drink orders but informed our 23 year-old Chinese friend in a very cold and apathetic tone that she would not be able to order alcoholic beverages at RM since they would not, out of preference, recognize either of her 2 forms of identification from China. \n\nOur friend was confused since she had ordered drinks at several venues in town before without issue. There was no explanation provided. We apologized to our friend and ensured her that this is not how most venues in the United States treat visitors. \n\nAbout 10 minutes after drinks were served we were asked to leave the pub since it was 10 pm and our 23 year-old friend could not prove she was 21. She apologized to the group emphatically for causing a scene. We felt horribly for her and for the fact that our waiter took and placed our orders minutes before she knew we would be asked to leave."
1,"My husband has his dress pants hemmed here and they always do a great job. So, after a botched job at a different place I took in my black dress pants to have the zipper replaced....again! It took 5 days and cost $16 dollars, I paid $12 for the messed up job at the other place, but AZ Alterations did a great job.\n\nThe store could use some sprucing up and a more modern register but overall I am very satisfied with the customer service and quality of work."
0,"The positive reviews are shocking to me! This was not at all our experience.\nHere are the facts:\n-The metal handrails, all over the park, heat up so fast in the Vegas sun it will burn your hand; watch out for this if you have smaller children\n-The staff is a group of unorganized teenagers with no clue or concern about customer service. They aren't trained well and it was difficult to even find someone who was actually 'in charge' to help with problems\n-The lines are RIDICULOUS!!!! If you don't pay for the speed pass to hold your place in line for a ride, you have to stand-uncovered in the Vegas sun-to wait for a raft, then climb up the tower to again wait in line to actually go down the slide. Be prepared bc this adds another $35+ to your general admission ticket\n-The rental rafts are a waste of money. They can only be used on 2 'rides' & none of the slides. Plus people just abandon them throughout the day so just pick up one of those when you want to float on one. \n-The food is overpriced and gross, the sunscreen is outrageous, but I realize those prices are par for the course at any amusement park. \n-Parking is a nightmare. Be prepared to walk...far\n\nMaybe in a couple more years they will have some of the kinks worked out but it's nothing but an expensive hassle.  Save your time & sanity as a local & just take your kids to the Rio pool for free."
1,"Ok so this is Vegas.  So nothing is cheap.  But the burger is out of the world.  Crunch burger with potato chips.   Bottomless diet Cokes.  Lots of seats.  So burger, fries and drink. $16.50.   Can get beef, turkey or chicken breast.  Enjoy people."

1,"You gotta love a place that gives you free samples of any and all flavors for you to try! I'm lactose-intolerant and how sad my life was before I found the Gelato Spot! They have AWESOME sorbet that is so luxurious and rich that you won't even notice that it is dairy-free!! All my lactose tolerant friends savor their opulent gelato! The employees are very nice, helpful and friendly! When I bring a friend who is new to the wonderful world of Gelato, I love the size their eyes get when they see all the flavor options. Forest Berry sorbet is THE BEST!!!!"
0,"So, you're outside walking and it's dark out. How is it possible that you walk into a bar and it's even darker? Well, my friends, it is possible at Mario's.\n\nFrom what you can see, the place looks pretty cool. It's clean. Nice big bar. I remember liking the decorative old fashioned ceiling. It was pretty quiet and low key for being a night for entertainment - yes, karaoke was going on and it was mighty fun for the dozen or so people that are actually at the restaurant.\n\nYour eyes eventually adjust and you meet your waitress after awkwardly seating yourself. She gets you a water and hands you a menu. Then she disappears. For twenty minutes. She apologizes and takes your order as you're literally about to leave and finally refills your drink.\n\nEventually, after all of that water, you need to use the facilities. Let me warn you ladies --- don't wear difficult shoes here! The bathroom, although clean and bright (blindingly bright compared to the rest of the place) is at the bottom of steep stairs! I can only tell you the damage I would do to myself if I combined alcohol, those stairs and some high heels! :)\n\nSo, you've drank all of your water and the entertainment is waning. You're then wondering why you're still there. Oh, yeah, that's right. You ordered food FORTY FIVE MINUTES AGO!\n\nI ordered some avacado turkey sandwhich. It was okay, a little dry so order some mayo or ranch if you decide that you want to go somewhere and wait over an hour for mediocre food and crap service.\n\nOh, and just a reminder, when the waitress tells you that your bill is taken care of because of how awful the service was, remember that \""taken care of\"" actually means they're knocking $3.50 off of it and tossing in a drink chip.........\n\n\nHey Mario - I won't be seeing you."
1,"this buffet definitely has a lot of variety.  i thought it would never end haha.  best part is unlimited drinks!  wine/beer included.\n\nit's about 30 minutes from the strip, and $36 plus change for the meal.  guess they just started this last saturday, but...\n\nTIP: if you go on SATURDAY get a player's card (free) and get a buy one get one free meal!"
0,"Zoe's is probably not a place to go if you are a Vegan. Actually, it's probably not a place to go if you are a T-rex either. When it comes down to it, this chain is no better than Chik-fil-a in what it offers. At least with Chik-Fil-A I get my food quickly and a nice side of cross-cut fries.\n\nZoe's Kitchen sits across the street from My Florist which, when you really think about it, was a dumb move on corporate's part. Both look to provide healthy food options in a market of fast food and grease. The problem is that, despite My Florist's problems, it is local, more diverse, and doesn't make you feel like you are eating in an Ikea showroom.\n\nThe food is just bad. My chicken sandwich was dry. Drier than the Mohave dry. I'm trying not to dive into other forms of hyperbole but this chicken was born and raised inside a Popiel Food Dehydrator. The least they could do would be to provide me with some mayo to fix things up a bit.\n\nThere's another one of these over on Camelback, it may or may not be better, but as far as our downtown one goes, this place will never see me or my money again."
1,"The food here was excellent, a little on the spicy side, but probably the best Indian food on the strip. The yellow dal was very good."
1,"I sent my Rolex President band to Sumpters for repining and refurbishment. They were in constant communication with me about the repairs, etc.  Ms. Carolyn McCoy was the person who kept in contact with me and she was great. I received the band today and it looked brand new.  It was in really bad shape when I sent it and I can't believe how good it looks now. \n\nAlso, their cost was very fair.  I feel I truly got my money's worth. \n\nI wholeheartedly recommend them for any type of Jewelery service.  \n\nBottom line, they tell you what they're  going to do and then they do it. ."
0,"Ughhhh I walked out of this restaurant with a sick and heavy feeling in my stomach.  I'm sorry stomach, never again!\n\nMy friend ordered the quadruple bypass, and I ordered the single.  The single was way more than enough lard and meat for me.  Just to complete the whole experience we ordered the flat liner fries too.  BAD CHOICE.  The first one was tasty, the ones that followed started tasting more like soggy potatoes dipped in lard.  \n\nThe quad was just pure insanity and my friend finished it.  D: He liked it but I was on the side ready to jump up if any CPR was needed.\n\nThe ambiance was cute.  Nurse waiters and waitresses, clever movie posters that parody the grill, and patient gowns for everyone!  \n\nArtery clogging food is definitely the main game of this place.  If you really want to have a myocardial infarction, eat here."
1,"This is a great dentist office! We had no wait time and were taken right away. The dental asst. was very patient with my son, so was the dentist. The dentist, Dr. Amy, explained things to my son very clearly and he understood even though he's 3. They have flat screens above the chairs and they are positioned so that you can watch while laying back. So cool! I would recommend this office to any parents who want an easy dentist visit."
0,"Let's face it, McDonald's isn't exactly gourmet fast food, but at least it's fast, right? Wrong! This location blows. The drive thru is unbelievably slow. Worse, I'm not sure what I just ate; the first bite of that Egg McMuffin tasted like dish soap, and it was cold! I might also make one suggestion. It might behoove the owner/operator to have a person who speaks English working the drive thru."
0,"I want to love this place.  The location is great, the view is nice, the staff seem nice, and the prices are reasonable.  However, the food needs serious work.  The dessert menu needs to be replaced entirely.  I tried the mud pie and it was a huge slab of very hard frozen ice cream - not good.  I also tried the caprese salad the other day.  The tomatoes could have used more basil but were ok.  On the other hand, the small balls of mozzarella were far too numerous.  I would rather have a few chunks of better cheese.  The whole salad was covered in cheap (gross) Parmesan cheese (as was the bread).  This stuff is not cheese.  It has no taste and it doesn't belong on a caprese salad in the first place.  I suppose some Parmigiano reggiano could have been ok, but if that is too expensive, skip it.  I will be back, because I have been waiting for a neighborhood place, but please work on the food.  Good food does not have to be super expensive, but it takes some care with ingredients and preparation.    I hope to update my rating with at least another star in the near future - if not, I am sad to say, it won't matter because this restaurant will be gone."
0,"My friends invited my hubs and I to Fat Choy a few weeks ago.  Unfortunately, they were closed for a private event.  I was super bummed as I had been craving bao buns the entire day!  Opportunity presented itself again.  Looking back I can't help but feel that the cosmos was trying to intervene and keep us out if this place.  I have to agree with the reviewer who described the smoke gauntlet you had to pass through at the Eureka to get to Fat Choy.  Upon entering we saw an Asian man in a chef coat leaving.  We guessed that was Chef Sheridan.  Uh oh...\n\nOur server was friendly was patient as we tried to figure out how many of each thing we needed to satisfy our ravenous bao cravings.  We settled on two of each duck bao, pork bao, bone marrow and short rib rice.  We also ordered the potstickers and the sesame noodles.  The good: the potstickers and the pork bao, although according to the video of menu items showing, we were missing some key garnishes.  The bad: The bone marrow was not bad itself, but the floppy sourdough (why sourdough?) that came with it was a huge miss.  I've had the bone marrow at Comme Ca where Chef Sheridan came from and this one pales in comparison.  It was like the Walmart version.  The duck bao was not only missing all the garnishes, they seemed to be missing the duck.  It was a hoisin-like sauce and crispy skin.  That's it.  Not even enough skin to make it worthwhile.  Next up the short rib rice.  It came out cold.  Also it was missing the pickled mustard greens, which were substituted terribly with mixed salad greens and I'm pretty sure, straight up balsamic vinegar.  According to some of the other reviewers pics, we were missing some other garnishes too.  I was so jealous when I looked at those pics because that is not the food we got.  I wish the server had told us ahead of time that they were out of these items.  It's not like they were busy.  It was a Wednesday evening and two or three other parties were there.\n\nNot sure I'd give this place another chance.  Chef Sheridan, you need to let the bottle blond with the neck tatoos go, 'cause she is not doing your food justice!"
0,"Thought the staff was incredibly rude. With out anyone else in the restaurant, my party of four was asked to wait. After we were seated and ordered our food did not all come out together. My seafood portofino dish had about a cup of  oiling the bottom of the plate"
1,"I've been here a few times over the years and the dinner has always been fantastic but my latest find has been the happy hour appetizers.  I'm sure there are better deals in Las Vegas but how often can you catch a game, eat delicious steak sliders with crisp homemade chips for only $10.  I know you're thinking what about drinks, those are full price but if you're ever looking for a snack before a show like I recently was, this was a great place to have a drink, quick bite, and meet up with friends.  \n\nIf you're up for a nice dinner with friends, then please do try the regular dining.  The service is attentive but not bothersome and the food is prepared well and always as you like.  I've made it a date night and equally well for dinner with the guys, great good and great people watching if you get a table out front."
0,"First off I would like to say that this place has great DJs and a great light show set up.\n\n However there are many reasons why I would not want to come back to this club. I have been to many clubs in Las Vegas including Marque, XS, Tao, and lights. I have been to Vegas 10 times in the past 3 years so I know the pros and cons of clubs. \n\nFirst: The bouncers are not friendly. I try to start a conversation and I will be ignored and they are not polite at all. \n\nSecond: The venue is really crowded with no standing room. If you do not have bottle service then this place is not for you.  \n\nThird: Water is 8 dollars and you guys don't offer tap water? I just spent 100 dollars on drinks and I can't even get a glass of water?\n\nIt is still a nice and amazing looking club but it would not be my first choice in Vegas."
1,"It feels a little out of place to begin branching off into reviews of places like public libraries and other non-food based locales. But this new downtown library fills me with the sort of warmth and goodwill that inspires a positive review to anyone who will listen to me preach from my digital soapbox.  \n\nPlus, there's a cafe inside now so... let's just pretend it's a very large internet cafe with a huge book shelf.\n\nA few days after it's grand re-opening, I stopped in to gawk and be happy that my library was open again. A friendly greeter announced that I should make sure to check out the children's section downstairs. Good call. Bright, airy, and huge, the children's level on the lower floor is gorgeous. It's filled with crawl-in book nooks, padded climb-on-me furnishings, private study rooms, play mats, mini-castles, game areas, age-based sections, audio/video stations with iPads around the edges, and who knows what else. I felt like a creeper wandering childless and alone in my 30's in this area, gawping at the selection and wondering if anyone would judge me if I curled up in the padded nook below the stairs.  So I didn't stay long down there, but every time I am there I peek in, wishing I were tiny again.\n\nI also couldn't bring myself to wander into the \""Teen Zone\"" on the first floor. It looks like they have a sheltered TV/Movies lounge in there, along with of course an age-appropriate selection of books and so on.\n\nPast the forbidden Teen Zone and tucked into a back corner is an amazing AV / Computer / Media Lab. It's stocked with a sound proofed recording box, photoshop, video editing tools, and everything else I wish I could afford on my home PC and waitress wages. \n\nLets not forget, of course, the main attraction. Books!  Books everywhere!  Bright and individually lit shelves make browsing easy. Tidy and well organized, I always seem to find myself inexplicably in a section far away from my point of origin with no idea how I arrived there. The fairy-lights must have led me from shelf to shelf, beckoning me with well-displayed arrays of beautiful, beautiful books.\n\nThere is a newly improved selection of comics, mangas, graphic novels and other assorted art-related narratives. A very respectable movie rentals section. Foreign films arranged by language?  Hooray!  Non-fiction stacks so immaculately designed and well kept that I never fear that the one book I need will be unlocatable amidst the chaos of the dingy, ramshackle stacks of yore.  (Which I still love, because.... because books! Oh the smell of old, stale unarranged books...)\n\nThe staff are always friendly and helpful, there's always an open computer in the main area, the self-checkout seems to work perfectly, and my reserved books are always waiting for me on the holds shelves, like old friends who know where I'll be, because I can't stay away.\n\nOh yea, and there's a little cafe in there now."
0,"I stayed here over the weekend (September 26-28) and was honestly not pleased. I booked with my HHonors and checked in with their app. The app lets you add things to your room before you arrive (refreshments, extra pillows etc.). I knew we were going to be coming in late so I requested two bottles of smart water and extra pillows (I'm eight months pregnant). None of this was provided upon arrival. When we arrived we found out there was no valet and self parking was $14 a day. The self parking garage is not close enough for me to walk so my husband and had to get the car and leave me in the lobby waiting. If $30+ wasn't enough for parking they also charge $10 for WiFi for just a day! When I called the front desk to see if she could offer me anything since I was a loyal HHonors member she simply said no and wouldn't help me. The room was clean and I had no problems with it accept that the bath tub was small and I couldn't sit down and fit. I love Hilton hotels and will continue doing business with them but this DoubleTree was a no in my book."
0,"My review is for the Service Department.  \n\nI took my Contour here because my transmission suddenly started leaking fluid.  The service writer at Friendly Ford said my transmission was shot and that I needed to fork over $2,000 to replace it.  Fortunately, I decided to call Aamco for a second opinion.  It turned out a vent hose for the transmission had gotten kinked when my battery was replaced.  Aamco didn't even charge me because he found the problem as soon as he opened the hood!  I would never trust Friendly Ford with my car again."
0,"Never have I ever waited this long for sushi. I will never come back to this restaurant. This is by far the worst service I've ever gotten. I came with about 5 of my friends and we ordered all you can eat and we ordered a decent amount of rolls but they came out once at a time, in thirty minute intervals. We asked nicely what was going on with our rolls but they were rude about it. It I could give this restaurant ZERO stars I would. Do not go here unless you want rude servers and horrible service."

1,"My boyfriend and I are huge fans of Oregano's, go at least twice a month, and have been to every one in the Valley and the one in Flagstaff.  Clearly, it's my favorite!  \n\nFirst off, the service has always been extremely friendly and welcoming.  The North Scottsdale location has great customer service.  On one visit after waiting 45 minutes for a deep dish we were told it was wrong, and we were given the half that was correct, a new pizza, a drink for each of us, and the offer of dessert.   A second time, again after waiting 45 minutes, our pizza was dropped and we got a drink and our pizza for free.  \n\nWe are in love with the thin crust, deep dish, and cheesy bread.  Can't say much for any thing else on the menu - we don't order it!  Definitely get a bellini if you're up for a drink - yummy!!  And a pizookie!!\n\nYes, the wait is around 45 minutes every day of the week, but most of the time they will let you put in a deep dish pizza order while you are waiting.   Love it!"
0,"My husband had been here before & loved the apple pie ala mode.  It had been served hot with the ice cream lusciously  melting onto it. This time our experience was quite different. We had ordered black & bleu burgers with onion rings. The onion rings were quite good, burger was fine. The bun was mediocre & it was served with packets of mayo. Didn't see that coming. The thing is the service was so slow. It took forever to just get the burgers. Then it took our server 20 minutes to clear & get our pie order. I get it takes awhile to cook the pie but we heard the pie was at the pass 10 minutes before it was served to us, cold. We didn't even eat it but got the bill & left. The service was inexcusable. We are done with Bill Johnson & his big apples."

I had a lovely Bellini with ripe raspberry while waiting for our table and we all enjoyed the pastry samples that were put out in the bar area. Needless to say, they were delicious!\n\nI ordered the cinnamon apple oatmeal and brioche with jam which was outstanding and my boyfriend ordered sourdough waffles with bananas and walnuts. He loved them! Other dishes at the table included \""bread pudding\"" french toast, yogurt parfait, and pastries; everyone was very happy with their meals.\n\nAll in all, we really enjoyed our brunch."

1,"One of the best breakfasts I have had.  I had the breakfast sandwich with the chorizo potatos and my wife ordered the eggs benedict with a short rib on top.  Both were amazing but I have to say my favorite part of the meal was the thick cut bacon, its kind of like a ham steak.  This was incredible.  I liked it so much I ordered my second bloody mary with a side of bacon in it.  Don't knock it till you try it.  The best part was the bloody marys are $3.50 all day.  With bacon you do pay extra though!  We have since been back for lunch and several other breakfast and were equally impressed.  Also try the BLD iced coffee.  I will try and post a picture of the bacon mary."
1,"I found this place on groupon. My boyfriend and I got the deal, $10 for $20 worth of food. We went before 4pm for lunch so we took advantage of the ribeye for $9.99 each, with two sauces on the side. The plate of ribeye came with about 9 pieces each. It came with rice, noodles, spinach, cabbage, mushrooms, and some more side items.Everything was delicious!! It was our first time here and also the first time we've ever had food served like this. The server was very attentive and understanding of us not having any knowledge on what to do lol. It was simple, for anyone who hasn't experienced it yet. You just cook the meat in the boiling water for about 10 seconds, and veggies for a few minutes. I also ordered california rolls as an appetizer. They were delicious as well. At first I thought they were bigger than usual but I realized it was because they cut it into 6 pieces rather than the 8 I'm used to. It was all so good we decided to add another plate of ribeye for an additional 7.95. The food, service, and experience was all great. We'll definitely be coming back even with out a groupon!"
1,"We originally found Joe's while vacationing in Anaheim and were SO HAPPY that they have one close to us in Tempe. The atmosphere of this place is AMAZING. I love how they are so patient while you decide from the infinite list of ever changing flavors, and let you sample everything you like! Service is amazing, and of course the product is one of a kind. Nothing compares!!!! We will definitely be visiting frequently."
0,"I wish I'd done a Yelp review before stopping at Sammy's on the way home from Vegas.  \n\nAt first glance, the ambience was good and we were excited to sit down to breakfast prior to our flight.  We like to sit at the bar, because you usually get really good service there.  We enjoyed the slide show of Sammy Hagar and his friends showing on the tv screen over the bar.  At first it seemed ok - we had access to menus which were already on the counter... but then service took awhile.  We noticed that the bartender was a cocky, rude guy who was super excited about being himself - not impressed.  Once I finally got my coffee and drank it, I had to practically wave my arms frantically to try to get him to give me a refill.  The food was \""ok\"", although my boyfriend didn't like his at all.  \n\nWe will not be going back to Sammy's."

Part X\n\n(For Part IX, go to: http://www.yelp.com/biz/stamoolis-brothers-company-pittsburgh?hrid=8hA8rRHss2PRlroWujzT_Q)\n\nThe Sunseri name is famous in Pittsburgh, and although their small alcove of Italian meats and bread is one of the smaller storefronts in the Strip, their pepperoni bread is melt in your mouth, filled with great mozzarella cheese.  I grabbed a loaf and we picked at it while we walked around.  My mom and I inhaled half of it without blinking an eye.\n\nIf you are going to get a loaf of Sunseri's pepperoni bread, I would suggest not doing it on an empty stomach.\n\n(For Part XI, go to: http://www.yelp.com/biz/primanti-brothers-pittsburgh?hrid=k97SGRvnhBMrHzqofs1WNg)"
1,Jesse came out today and sprayed our condo for scorpions. He was super friendly and obviously knew what he was talking about. Explained many solutions for our horrible scorpion problem. Great price as well! I'm excited to see the results but Jesse was awesome.
1,"I am reviewing the \""Day Spa\"" part of Boulder Falls Pet Resort & Day Spa.  Altho, please note that I have used, and will continue to exclusively use, their Pet Resort for boarding and doggie day care when I need it.  \nI have a 1 year old Australian Shepherd and he is absolutely crazy.  He is a smart dog, but his kryptonite is other dogs; all his manners go out the window and he just barks and jumps and wants to play with his 4-legged friends.  I took him to Boulder Falls today to get him shaved down due to lots of shedding. This was the first time I had used a dog groomer.  I was pretty nervous that he was going to be out of control for the groomer and he would come back 1/2 shaved, or nicked, or have a cut somewhere, or his coat would be completely uneven.  He was none of the above.  He looked great!!!  I can not give Boulder Falls' Day Spa anything but 5-stars because I know my dog, and I know he's a handful, and I know that they did a wonderful job shaving him and blending his head!  And to top it off, he was outside playing ball with the groomer before I came and got him! Lastly, the price (compared to a big chain pet store you have all heard of) is very reasonable!"
0,"For Vegas, I would expect a little better.\n\nI was in Vegas for a big fight weekend, staying at the Luxor. Our group debated back and forth between Tender at the Luxor and Strip Steakhouse at Mandalay. Out of convenience we chose Tender.\n\nThat was a mistake. \n\nThe staff was friendly, the decor was pleasant. And then it went slightly downhill.\n\nThe appetizers were just okay. The oysters were oysters and tasted fairly fresh. The salads were pretty unimaginative across the table. I ordered the standard Iceberg wedge and it was okay.\n\nI ordered the beef strip steak. It was fatty and a little grisly. Another guy ordered the ribeye medium rare and it came as beat-red rare as I've seen. Not to mention the meat was not that TENDER. Two guys ordered the grass-fed bison steaks and those were pretty good. They had a nice grass-fed taste and were cooked proper. But they weren't brilliantly seared or overly juicy.\n\nThe sides were pretty mediocre as well. We had the mushrooms, the creamed spinach, and mac and cheese. Nothing out of the ordinary or memorable.\n\nOverall, it wasn't the worst steakhouse experience by any stretch. It was \""just okay\"". We left FULL but UNIMPRESSED.\n\nAnd unfortunately, with all the amazing choices for steakhouses in Vegas, DO YOU REALLY WANT TO SETTLE FOR \""JUST OKAY\""?"
1,"The only place I visited in Vegas that I'd like to buy a condo.  The staff here... unbeleivable.\n\nA short story... WHile waiting in the lobby for a vendor to join me for dinner a guest and his yappy dog came in the front door walking towards the elevator.\n\nAs soon as the dog hit the (presumably very expensive) carpet it drug his face the whole way.\n\nWhere as I would have hung the dog by his collar the bellhop and receptionist smiled accomodatingly.\n\nLots of kids and pets in the 20 minutes or so I was there.\n\nThe bar tender was more interested in talking with the attractive female staff though.\n\nOh, the gift shop has very cool things and they aren't over priced (which shocked me)."
1,"Our hike up to the towers began at the trail just south of the visitor center. This portion of the trail, about a mile or so, was mostly flat through the desert and allowed us to get in a great jog before reaching the base. Trail markers are not clear and there are a few options up to the towers, some easy and some difficult. We had to ask a few hikers along the way if we were on the right path heading in the right direction.  We were pointed in the direction of the difficult hike which of course we took. So up we went steady, resting and short bursting all the way up to the towers.  We reached the towers, rested for a bit, took in the view and began our descent on the opposite side of the mountain.  The north potion of the slope led us back to the flat-lands and yet another sprint/jog to the visitor center were we came upon a group people in a T'ai Chi session. That was nice.  \n\nTip: This is a great hike if you want to include some sprint/jog activity. \nHike Length: 5 miles round trip\nDifficulty: Moderately strenuous  \nFacilities: Water, restrooms and a very nice visitor center with staff."
0,"Blah!  I had such an average meal here last night.  I remember it being much better when we ate here a few years ago. However, I was totally unimpressed last night.  We ordered the bisque and I couldn't even finish it.  Not that great.  The halibut reminded me of a cafeteria.  All in all, complete waste of money.  If I want good seafood, I'll head to Mastro's.  Oh, and our waiter never noticed that I didn't eat my bisque, because he never came to check on us.  Average food and below average service. I won't be back.  There are so many better places to eat in Vegas."
1,"Was in town on vacation and my Sun devils were playing that night. So I saw that the Alumni group has it's game watching parties there, so we headed over. It is a good drive from the strip, but once you get out there, it looked like a stucco oasis in a strip mall. (Cue the blowing tumbleweed)\n\nThen I walked in... WOW! Nice place. The party was in one of the VIP rooms with couches and comfy sofas with big ass TVs! As soon as I walked in, I was greeted by a friendly waitress and she got my drivers license and automatically got me a players card and a drink. Works for me!\n\nIt is true - for happy hour, they have 50% off their thin crust pizzas! And they are really good. Had the nachos and some wings too! Really good food! \n\nThe service was good, the place was clean, and it had a really good crowd. The only thing that sucked was the devils lost and having to drive back to the strip! LOL!"
1,"There is nothing bad to say about JFG! I came for the first time a couple of years ago almost when our best friends moved to Gilbert.  We make sure we go there EVERY TIME we are in the area -- it was also fun to see that it was a Triple D and to check out what items Guy Fieri checked out.  I unfortunately haven't spread out from my norm much because I love my burger with bleu cheese and mushrooms on it! Their different fries like the garlic fries and loaded baked potato fries are delish, and their onion rings are DELIGHTFUL.  They make KILLER homemade lemonade (I get the Strawberry!) and know how to make a mean milkshake.  Everything else I've seen on the menu that people have gotten have looked nothing short of amazing so maybe one day I'll stray from the norm!"
1,had a meal from hear tonight it was  better than most 'a little on the expensive side but very nice very fresh would order from them again
1,"Hole in the wall. Before our food even came out they brought us some granola, which was to die for. \n\nI got the Breakfast Burrito with Chorizo, it was pretty good. Instead of your standard tortilla they use a chipotle crepe. And it's only $8($6.75 w/o chorizo), you can't really beat that. \n\nFor dessert I went with the \""First Time,\"" which is a banana and Nutella br\u00fbl\u00e9e crepe, it was perfect. Not too sweet, just right. There's not much room for error when it comes to bananas and Nutella. \n\nOverall it was a great place, highly recommend it. It wasn't busy at all when I went but it was a Thursday, I can only imagine what the weekends look like."
0,"Located in the food court/student union at UNLV, this Starbucks is my least favorite location.\n\nEvery time I have gone there is a line. It ranges from 5-30 people, and moves slowly.\n\nThey won't redeem the free drinks and food items I have earned on my Starbucks card. I get that this location is on a campus, but it's still annoying.\n\nThey've been out of ingredients on several occasions."
1,"I absolutely LOVE Rita's. Is my ultimate favorite dessert spot. The workers are always in such good moods and you can tell they really enjoy working there. Then again, who wouldn't!?"
0,"So much on the menu here is just too needlessly expensive. Another victim of the \""Hey it's Vegas, charge 75% more than that would cost anywhere else\"" mentality. In my opinion, you're better off hogging as many free chips as you can (the three salsas were well liked by everyone) and ordering a salad. That formula should get you full enough while being budget friendly. The salad I got was the Watercross, Avocado and Orange salad. It was delicious once I got rid of the avocado. It came with three bacon-wrapped dates stuffed with chorizo and blue cheese that created a flavor fiesta in my mouth. We had a nice outdoor table on a patio that overlooked the impressive Mandalay Bay pool. The restaurant is tucked in the very back of Mandalay Bay like it's some kind of ugly duckling."
1,Nice theater
0,"The smell of grease pervades this place and stuck to me for hours after I left.\nI love spring rolls.  They are are supposed to be light and fresh and full of nice crisp veggies, the spring rolls are Asian One are like sticky logs of blandness.  The Angel chicken wings are one of the most pointless and hardest to eat foods that I have ever come across.  It is a chicken wing stuffed with pork and veggies and it was greasy and bland.\nThose were the only things I tried, they may have good dishes there, but after trying two and being dissappointed by both of them, I will not return."
1,"Hands down one of the best cupcake places I have gone to throughout the country!  You kind of have to drive out to the middle of nowhere outside Las Vegas to get to it but definitely worth the drive!  \n\nWhat's special about this place is they let you customize your cupcakes to whatever you like.  You pick the cake, the filling, the frosting, and any toppings to your liking.  I thought it was an interesting concept but I did not expect that the quality of the stuff would taste amazing.  \n\nThe first one I got was the red velvet cupcake and had them inject vanilla filling inside.  Then, they put the vanilla whipped frosting on it.  The cake was very moist and light and I could just eat the cake all day long.  The added vanilla filling & whipped frosting were perfect.  After one cupcake, I got a second cupcake with vanilla cake & orange filling.  Another amazing combo!  \n\nThe place has a cute Alice in Wonderland theme.  A very friendly staff too!  And just so fun to watch them make your cupcake!"
1,"Originally the boyfriend, boyfriend's mom, and I went to Lake Las Vegas to have lunch at Black Pepper Grill, but they were closed... We discovered Bernard's Bistro and thought we'd give it a try.\n\nThe waiter was very nice and friendly. Since it was at the end of the lunch hour, we had the restaurant to ourselves. Nice decor inside and we sat next to the Frank Sinatra wall.\n\nI got the Caribbean salad (don't remember the full name) w/a curry dressing. The waiter said it was there top selling dish and I could see why. It was delicious!!\n\nThe waiter also suggested we come back on the weekend, where they have live music, show films, and have all sorts of fun outdoor activities.\n\nOverall it was a great experience, great service, and great food.\nI will be going back to see try there dinner menu and enjoy the night time activities by Lake Las Vegas."
0,"Wow, I'm reviewing a strip club...\n\nA friend of ours made us go to the Velvet Lion since he was hooking us up with a party bus for pretty much the weekend.  The club itself is nice.  It has a nice decor and it's clean with comfy long sofas.\n\nThis is so mean but the girls are not attractive whatsoever, especially for a Saturday night.  When we walked in the door, the girl on the main stage looked like she was 5 months pregnant, her belly was so big.  The girl after her was so skinny, in a not cute way.  I'm not hating.  Even the guys in our group were like eww.  And the fell on the stage and ate sh*t.  My friend did get a lap dance from a girl with really nice long legs.  And we also chatted with this girl that had a great, athletic body.  Most athletic body I've ever seen on a stripper in my life (not that I've seen that many strippers).  \n\nI absolutely wouldn't go here again unless I absolutely had to i.e. used the limo service to go somewhere else and had to stop by Velvet Lion as justification."
0,"I wish upon all the stars that I could give out negitive stars!!!!! \n\nDO NOT EVER WALK INTO THIS VERIZON STORE!!!!!!! Trust me! Stay AWAY!\nI walked in, nobody was up in the front taking names sooooo I wonder around the store. We were there because I FINALLY talked my mom into moving into the 21st centery! She was going to buy an iphone!!!! \nWe watched people walk in behind us, they were walked up to and asked for their names... UH WHAT????!!!!!!!! You mean to tell me I walked in ahead of people and now I'm 5 down the list? WHERE THE F WHERE YOU when we walked in?\n\nWe are nicely dressed people, not some homeless bum walking in from off the street!!!!! Holy Cow.\nHowever I should not be surprised, everytime we have gone in here to THIS location, we have been treated horribly! Disrespectful people work here.\nIf you enjoy being treated like shit, by all means walk into this store any day of the week. That's what you will get.\nSo we stepped outside, and dailed *611 to tell them about how badly we were just treated. It kept disconnecting us! \n\n-10,000 stars for this verizon store location!!!!  As I walked out the door I said I can't wait to yelp about this & some employee actually started to yell at me. I really wish I would have turned around and gotten his name.\n\nI do however love my phone service, I've never had a dropped call or any slowing.\n\nBUT STAY AWAY FROM HERE!"
1,"Popeyes yes that's right Popeyes, after recently relocating from Chicago to Phoenix I wanted some fried chicken and Popeye's is what I like. Now Fried chicken competition is pretty stiff in the Chi you have Harold's, Uncle Remus, and Mac Arthur's but here in Phoenix I am not so sure of the local spots. There are not many Popeyes locations near my current residences but ahhh.... one is near my work location. Score and this one has the \""Tuesday Special\"" 2 pieces - leg and thigh for only .99 cents. Talk about an awesome deal, especially if you like dark meat which I do.  I did the drive thru cause I wanted to get home on the 51 before the traffic got bad and the window person was very nice and efficient. This is now my chicken spot here in AZ unless you know of another one that can get me tasty and spicy chicken I can't be persuade differently."
1,"I love this place!  I had lunch on the patio, awesome patio, and had the peppercorn burger... f&ck yeah!"
1,"The lamb chop is very tender and delicious. It is cooked with fruits so maybe a bit too sweet for people who don't like sweet taste, but for me it is very good. I also like the service, the decoration, and the atmosphere there."
0,"We have been customers for a while now the delivery is usually ok I sent in a comment to the company to note our concern,  they never even responded it took almost 2 hr to get a large pepperoni delivered to our address which they have done on several occasions however this Friday it was cold not in a insulated bag and the driver didn't even show concern NEVER and I mean NEVER will I order from them they just take your money with no concern of customer service or returning customers well there are just to many pizza joint to put up with this"
0,"I usually have nothing bad to say about this place since the treatments are always so great, but my last visit set me over the edge with their management.\n\n Very poorly run business.\n\n I called to schedule an appointment for my daughter and I for her Birthday. We came in at our expected time to find that the guy at the front desk wrote us down for another day. I would have understood that mistakes happen, but it was the fact that he made it seem like it was my fault we were written down for another day. All he needed to do was own up to the mistake made and we would be on our way. \n\nWhat ever happened to \""the customer is always right?\"" Not at this place. I would suggest getting someone new up at the front desk ASAP. I would hate for others to have the same experience."
0,"Prices are high, choices are limited, the staff is small. Do not try to call or search for help. Michael's is way better in my opinion."
1,"I seem to be hanging out in chains lately... and none of them are blowing me away!  This location of Paradise Bakery has one special thing going for it - they have frozen yogurt!  (I don't think any of the other locations have fro yo).  Other than that, this Paradise Bakery is pretty standard.  \n\nLocated right near the fountains in \""the District\"" area of Desert Ridge (not far from the AMC Theater), you can get consistently ordinary sandwiches and salads here.  I usually go with the walnut chicken salad sandwich or salad - their multigrain bread is not bad but their salad dressings and additional toppings are not anything special.  Pretty average actually...\n\nParadise Bakery is getting an extra star (increasing my rating from 3 to 4) because they offer cookie cakes that are awesome!  With a couple of hours notice, they will customize your cookie cake and it's always a hit at a party... recently, we ordered a cookie cake for my friend Shauna's birthday - it not only looked adorable, but tasted great too!  Go for the cookies - not necessarily the food!"
0,I usually do a lot of my clothes shopping at this location. Today they were exceptionally unfriendly
1,"Well this place is really neat. The only way you wont like your food is if you screw it up. i recommend that for your first time you get the endless bowl and dont pile the stuff on when you go through the line. That way if you really hate it you can start over!\nThere are recipe cards at the beginning of the line, which we did not use. You will choose your proteins first. a great variety of beef, chicken, pork, sausage, shrimp, calamari, scallops etc.\nnext choose your spices, a little goes a long way and remember that you have the choice of sauces at the end of the line too. the dragon salt I am told is very spicy\nnext choose your vegetables a great selection of raw vegetables and some fruits even pico de galo, there is whole eggs there too if you like that in your stir fry. \nat the end you can choose your sauce, leave it off all together or have them cook it in or maybe take it to your table to add yourself. there are small spoons to taste the different sauces, but please be courtious to the patrons behind you throughout the line and donw linger in one area to long.\n\nnext approach the cooking station and tell them what starch you would like, I myself loved the noodles in mine, my husband gets the fried rice.\n\ntake your number card to your table and place it in the stand that is on your table, if you have several cards fan them out so the servers can see it and bring you the bowl when finished cooking. \n\nmy husband has a rewards card and if you live near here is it well worth it! you can get free bowls really quickly!\nthis is a fun expereince for children since it is almost like they are making there own meal, in a sense they are except for the actual cooking!\n\nWe will go again!"
0,I think its awesome being able to get the same clothing you could get from top notch store for only half the price at Ross. But I shouldn't have to sacrifice receiving good service just to get a discount. This is my first time yelping.   I've been offered to yelp after I got very poor service in the past and turned it down  but after receiving this poor service I had to yelp.... this goes out to the lady the back of the store in the fitting room.  And She was very rude and she had a very very poor attitude....  good Luck Ross.  I did not will not buy from here.\n\n\nson of this yelp account
1,One of my favorite places to eat. The food is great. In my opinion best burger in Phoenix. My only complaint is that the service is always slow. Pleasant but slow. I always enjoy my meal but leave a little annoyed at how long it took to get the bill and cash out.
1,"I needed to get an emissions test for my car so that I could register it back home. My boyfriend told me to go here since this is where he went. \n\nThey have several locations on their website, not all of them have Yelp listings so I would recommend taking a look at it to see if there's one closer to where you live or want to go. You can also see how busy each one is too and the expected wait time.\n\nI went on a Saturday afternoon and there were 3 lanes open with a few cars in each line. The time went by quickly. I was in and out in about 10 minutes and it costed $27.75. Very efficient and a pain free process."
0,"I was very disappointed and offended by our server on my visit to hash house. He not only seemed to know absolutely nothing about the menu, he served me a meal with garlic in it after I told him I was allergic!! He clearly had no regard for his job or for other people!! Unfortunately due to this experience I will not be going back"
1,"Ah T.C. Eggington's...I wish your brunch lines weren't such a feat of strength. If you're going on the weekend, be prepared to wait. \n\nThis is a cute spot in a nondescript shopping center that is home to a Boot Barn and a few of your typical commercial center shops. You'll know where T.C. is by the line of people anxiously waiting to get their bacon and egg on in various stages of \""ohmygodhowlonghavewebeenwaiting.\""\n\nThe menu is a fun mix of omelettes, egg creations, pancakes, waffles and lunch. Honestly, I've only glanced once at the lunch menu because I mean well..it's an egg place. I came for the eggs.\n\nThey have really good housemade jams that are on the table and ready to be slathered on their homemade english muffins which will put those store bought kind to shame. They come slightly buttered and are just a little crisp around the edges. They're very light and not spongey like the ones that come in a plastic bag at the market.\n\nMy favorite omelette is the o'pear grenache a mixture of pears, sliced almonds and Havarti. I know, who puts pears in an omelette? But it's one of those weirdly delicious flavor combinations that you would never put together yourself. \n\nThe beverages are solid-I've enjoyed every cup of coffee and juice that I've had here and they now offer adult beverages which is a rich reward for what is often a long wait.\n\nThe service is friendly and attentive, even during the busiest hours and the wait staff wears old timey button down and khaki numbers that really just have to be seen to be believed (and understood). I think crazy socks are part of the uniform too because I've never seen an average pair in the times that I've dined there and believe me, I've looked.\n\nDespite the wait this is a consistently good brunch option that I will continue to wait for!"
0,"The wash is good, a little pricey but what really bothers me is the up selling! I've been going there since 95 and it has had several owners but now I'm going to wash my sweet 01 Tacoma somewhere else. \nThe guy sees my sun faded, bleached trim and scratches and I have to tell him ITS A FKN WORK TRUCK! It's my baby but detailing it is a lost cause.\nNow I get the windshield repair tech promising that they can repair all the chips in the glass and all we need is your insurance card. I told her today that my insurance is not glass friendly and besides none of the \""chips\"" that I could barely find were in my line of sight. I get the up sale twice by two people and while waiting for my truck. \n\nYou lost another customer as a result."
1,Went to see David Cook and Paper Tigers on 1/11/14.  Great room and show.  Good sound/strip view/good bar and service.  Make sure you don't pass by ticket counter on first floor.
1,"I'm not usually a huge Southern Indian food fan (I prefer the Northern fare), but my mum has taken me to pretty much every Indian restaurant in the greater Phoenix area and she wanted to try this one, so my brother and I tagged along (who says no to free Indian food? Who?). Food was awesome! Mum started off with the Mulligatawny soup, which was very spicy but really good, and my brother and I just ordered an extra side of bread (we always go with traditional garlic naan and we ordered an aloo peas paratha as well, which was very good). Mum had a dosai, which she is really fond of, for the life of me I cannot remember what my brother ordered, and I had the aloo mutter, which was fantastic. Our waiter was very nice and very helpful - a little too helpful, as he asked about the spice level we'd like (I said very low, as I know how spicy some places can get) and when Mum said an 8 out of 10 he replied, \""No, for you, a 3.\"" He was mostly joking but she was insisting she wanted it very hot and he kept trying to navigate her down. He probably saw her as a delusional white woman who would start crying the second she started eating and realized how hot it really was, but she grew up in India and ate nothing but Indian food in London in college, so she (unlike my pathetic palette) can handle some CRAZY spicy food, and he eventually gave up trying to change her mind. We had a really great dinner, and it was nice to see that they actually have a lot of Indian customers, which usually points to some authentic and delicious food. Will definitely be back, this place changed my mind about Southern Indian cuisine!"
0,We were VERY disappointed.  The customer services to TOP NOTCH but the food was OK. I'm glad we experienced Battista's but we will not return.
1,"Love this place.  Great desserts in a great area.  The area is really cool, looks like they took a neighborhood, asked the residents to leave and turned the houses into places of business.  But nice businesses.  I'm sure that's not what happened, but it's a great neighborhood.\nLots of different delicious looking flavors.  I go with the ever safe chocolate every time.  Yummy.\nService was great and place was cute.  Check it out."
1,"love it here! the pastries are always excellent and baked fresh at their other site. Its a pretty big place, there are always seats inside and out, which is really nice. The service was great and very friendly. They have really incredible whip on drinks- it has coffee flavor in it, so totally worth the extra calories :)"
0,Rude employees who aren't very intelligent or have much of a personality. I had a shirt done here and they put holes in it. I would not recommend this cleaners.
1,Always our favorite place for breakfast when we are in Las Vegas. If you love home cooking this is your place. The menu has a variety of items that are specials...try them! The service is great as is the food!
0,Augies sucks effen nasty... White nachos how bout no... Pretzel Burger how bout eff no 10000 thumbs down.!
0,"It had been a long time since I had eaten at a Garcia's and I was kind of looking forward to it.  Last one I actually ate at is now a Popo's.  I think I'll go to Popo's.  If the rudest hostess in all of Phoenix doesn't put you off the lack of air conditioning certainly will.  I'll be happy to see all the Garcia's close again.  And to the rude hostess, I hope you lose your job."
0,"I would not recommend this company to anyone. Terrible customer service, broken air conditioner on a 106 degree night. Driver was half hour late. Supervisor offered to switch bus for us, never did. The complimentary ice and water, not there.There are so many more party bus rentals in Las Vegas that we have used that blow this one away."
1,"This place is definitely growing on me, the only thing keeping them from getting 5 stars is they need to get rid of those horrible stairs! Who wants to walk up and down 100000000 flights of stairs when you're drunk and wearing 5 inch heels?? NO ONE. Anyways, Marquee is crackin I must admit. Came here a couple times and the music is on point. The hip hop room is growing on me, but it's so damn stuffy down there. Main floor is the house floor and that's where the crazniess is! They always have good DJ's spinning like EC twins, Dash Berlin, and Dirty South. \n\nMarquee's Dayclub is also a ton of fun. The layout and location is awesome... who doesn't wanna party in the sun and have water fights on the very top floor of the Cosmo? \n\nCan't wait to venture here again :)"
1,"The pastries are very good here. The raspberry turnover is my absolute favorite. The coffee is strong but very good, not at all resembling the burnt flavor of the typical French roast."
1,Very happy with the work Ray and his team has done on my '07 BMW 328i.  With over 116K miles on my car it's good to have a shop I am comfortable with.  My car and I like Scott's Motor Werks.
0,"This was our third time at Roadrunner.Once again, the service was slow and inattentive and the food was sub-par, even for a bar. Coming from a place that touts itself as a quality dining establishment, I was so under whelmed we sent back our food and left. Keep in mind that this is a huge place, and there was only our table and one other, so the 'staffing issues' couldn't really come into play unless the waitress was also cooking the food in the back. Not a bad place for a drink if you're at the bar, but I would stay away if you want to hang out with friends and relax.."
0,"Wow.. I've been to Hannys a handful of times but Saturday ruined it for me.. we just went in for the cocktails after being across to street. Much to my disappointment we were barely greeted at the door to sit at a.table for 10 minutes prior to being spoken to by a server.. we walked out. How insane? It will take an act of the heavens for me to go back.. only advice, sit in a highly visible area and make contact with your server promptly.."
0,"If I could give Alaska Airline 0 stars I would. With all of the Airlines that i have flown with, my worst experience would be with this Airline.  First, our flight was canceled in Seattle so we decided to call reservation while waiting to  talk to a customer service agent in person.  I was a little hesitant with the customer service agent because I saw the way she was servicing the person before us. Of course no smile, no nothing, she dreaded our existence as if she did not want to be working. I asked her about our flight and she had no clue it was canceled due to maintenance, she basically told us she couldn't help us so i ask for a supervisor. The supervisor at the station had the worst attitude in customer service that I have ever encountered, believe me when i said that i stayed calm the whole time.  The supervisor did not know the reasoning for the canceled flight either until she paged someone. Her rude attitude was no acceptable. We had an event the moment we land and had to be in the Las Vegas Convention center right after so our urgency to get on the next flight was not a concern to them. I asked if it was possible to get on the next available flight or another airline, they did not want to help, they did not give us any options, no nothing. Noted the cancellation was due to maintenance and not weather related but they felt like they don't have to take ownership for it.  As to many other airlines they understand that maintenance is under their control and would find ways to help their customers.  The reasoning for not helping us was of course we are not a \""diamond member, as she stated something close to that.  We asked if it's possible to put us on stand by for the next flight, she finally did, and after we took a few steps away form the counter we heard the supervisor gossiping about the situation, yes very professional.   Feeling uneasy about the experience, the night before leaving Vegas we got down to the conference room in our hotel building  and realized they had screwed up our flight coming back from Vegas to Seattle. Of course, with the service and screw up they have given us in Seattle, we were not surprise at all. When we called reservations they tried to place the blame on something else! What a sh!t show. Alaska Airline can not take ownership of their own companies fault, they pass it around to anything that they could to make their company hold that image of being the better airline.  The no good agent and supervisors in the Seattle Airport was a joke, Please fire them. Terrible work ethic and customer service.  They represent your company and if this is the face of Alaska Airline why should we choose your mileage card compared to other Airlines? Especially with Alaska Airline's terrible service? We shared this information inside the Las Vegas Convection Center with several people and will be sharing this terrible service to many more, for even though we are not your \""Diamond members\"" we are still your customers. We made the mistake of choosing your mileage program this past year. and now we know better. We know we fly frequently enough to know better that service should not be this terrible.  It was a big surprise for us due to the fact that Alaska Airline should be one of the best and from this experience, it was the worst out of the 8 flights i have taken this year."
1,Love Cheddars. We were so excited when they opened it here in the Valley. This is our favorite restaraunt . There maui margaritas are the best.
0,"Food ordered:\n\nDrinks - Rhubarb Fizz, Flying Dog Porter\nAppetizers - Potstickers and Lettuce Wraps\nEntrees - Dolsot Bi Bim Bap and Vietnamese Beef Noodles\n\nFor $12, the Rhubarb FIzz was underwhelming, over-iced, overly bittered. Flying Dog Porter is a great beer. The Potstickers were ok, but tiny, while the Lettuce Wraps were the star of the entire dinner. Vietnamese Beef Noodles were bland and flavorless. The menu lists them as including jalapeno, but there was no heat whatsoever. As for the Bi Bim Bap, I've had this a few times at Korean restaurants, and it was very... different. They essentially took the appetizers and side dishes and tossed them in the pot. The kim chi and pickled shiitake just didn't belong in the dish, and brought a very off flavor to the entire things. It took a full dousing of the goju jang for the dish to be eatable. Very very disappointing.\n\nService was ok. They asked how the meal was too many times, yet after 15 minutes I had to flag down a waiter just for them to take my card so we could pay and leave.\n\nIt was my wife's birthday, and we took advantage of Big Burrito's GREAT free entree promotion, but even with $23 worth of Vietnamese Beef Noodles taken off the check, I still felt completely ripped off paying $80 for the rest of the meal and a tip. I'd much rather go to Noodlehead and pay $20 for a much better meal next time."
1,It's so pretty in here. They have a good selection but everything is pricey. If you don't have a Fry's rewards card I suggest getting one. We used my aunt's number since we don't live in AZ. At least this way she'll get the fuel points and I got the discount.
0,"Will never order again.  Supposedly we got chicken chow mein, but I can't confirm it was actually chicken.  We also got beef with broccoli.  Broccoli seemed safe, but not sure what they grey meat was that came with it.  Never will order again."
0,"I had a tip from my Filipino friend in San Francisco to go here for some good Flip food.  We found it and tried it.  I am a big fan of Filipino food, even though it can be greasy.  My favorite dishes are sigsig, bistek, and pata.  \n\nPros:  Buffet style.  Lots of Variety.  Two dishes stood out - the pata and the beef curry dish.  \n\nCons:  I only liked 2 out of the 10+ dishes I tried.\n\nI guess this is Filipino fast food and connot compare to the likes of Ong Pin in Daly City, CA"
1,"Funktion Design created/installed our company logo, enlarged it, and put it on one of our walls in our reception area. It looks incredible and makes an awesome impression as clients, applicants, and partners, enter our building."
1,Great service. Called in to see if they had any other gluten-free cupcakes besides the flour-less chocolate base. When I explained it was for a graduation a week away- I was told that they had a gluten-free cookbook and a week was enough time to experiment and develop a GF Carrotcake cupcake (my original request).I'm looking forward to seeing how they turn out.
1,We recently used Pump It Up for a birthday party.  Great place for a children's birthday party. Well organized enthusiastic attentive staff.  The staff took the time to remember the children's names and did a great job making my daughter feel special. \nI recommend this to anyone looking for a great birthday party for children 4 and up.
0,Pretty average sushi nothing too special. The restaurant was pretty empty on Wednesday night. We ordered multiple roles the best role what's a spicy tuna the little piece of jalapeno on top of each roll. I've had a lot better sushi at better prices but I guess this is what you can expect in Vegas. At least I can say the fish tasted fresh
1,"As good as the high-priced place we used to go when we had vision insurance. With all the add-ons the other place got us for, I actually think we spend less at America's Best, even without insurance."
1,"We came here by default because the Pepper Mill had a 2 hour wait.  The wifey found this on Yelp, and we were so glad we came here.  Great breakfast food at very reasonable prices! I had the prime rib benny and the wife had the veggie benny. Both were delicious!  The wait was not bad and the service was quick.  If you're looking for good breakfast without going broke at the buffets on the Strip, I highly recommend this place. Way better than the Pepper Mill."
1,I love Salon Ivy. All the stylists are very nice and know what they're doing. I see Shannon. She always makes my hair look exactly how I wanted it too...plus it hardly hurts whens he waxes your eyebrows!\n\nThe salon itself is really gorgeous. The mirrors are big and it's a very open space. It's never super crowded and the stylists are never rushed. If you need a haircut you should go here!
1,The breakfast burrito never disappoints and the kids love the pancakes. Nice selection of coffee and bagels keeps everyone in the family satisfied. A little pricey but the food quality is good. For Ahwatukee it's probably 5 stars but sine there are better places around Phoenix its a 4. They should expand into a bigger space as this places gets crowded in a hurry.
1,"I am giving this place 4.5 stars. I went there on a night where it was so packed the line went from the front door to almost I dont know how long. All i know was that it was so long we waited an hour and got buzzed/drunk before we actually sat down to eat. I ate baby lobster, roast duck and their desserts + pistaccio ice cream. That was all I emembered after the alcohol consumption but I still give it two thumbs up.\n\nSORRY i meant crawfish.. I was probably still intoxicated when writing this entry LOL"
0,"The second time I went back to this restaurant was peculiar.  The waitress started out clingy and constantly complimenting my friend, then she became very pushy about wanting us to leave.  She brought our check with 2 fortune cookies on top, came back 2 minutes later, then tossed the cookies onto the table and wiggled the check at us.  I was willing to write off this occasion since my first was so good.\n\nI went back for a 3rd try and actually had to walk out because the service was so bad.  \n\nOur group of 4 came in and said that we needed a table for 4.  The hostess showed us to a table with only 3 seats at it, then looked confused when we pointed out that we needed another chair.  She then showed us to another table with 3 seats, then started to walk away.  When we got her attention to point out that 3 seats are never adequate for 4 people regardless which side of the room it is on, she told us to go \""wait in line\"" again.  \n\nTechnically there was no line, but we went back up to the front to wait for a 4th chair at either table.  While we were waiting for them to get their sh!t together, I noticed that the hostess was grabbing chairs from all over the restaurant and putting it at a table that did not have all of their dining partners.  I'm no restaurant owner, but it seems to me that it would be more important to seat people WHO ARE ACTUALLY THERE!  My blood was starting to boil, but we were seated and I was willing to forgive.\n\nWe had our menus and we were ready to order, but we waited and waited.  I think it was 15 minutes before the waitress (the weird clingy one from my second trip) came to our table, we had no drinks, no nothing.  We realized how much time we were wasting and discussed getting our food to go before the waitress finally appeared at our table.  When we mentioned getting our food to go, she gave us THE NASTIEST LOOK then told us that we would have to go tell the hostess what we wanted.\n\nI lost it.  I told the waitress that everything that we had experienced thus far was completely unacceptable and I wouldn't tolerate it.  I stood up to leave and she stood where she was (in my way), ignored me, and tried to take my dining companion's orders.  She finally backed off without even a glimmer of apology after my companion's realized that I really was leaving. \n\nI will not go back here ever again, no food is worth this treatment."
1,"While I frequent the shop in San Francisco, the first time I ever set foot into the store at the Premium Outlets in Las Vegas was amazing. There is an associate there, by the name of Anthony (I believe) who is a breath of fresh air. He greeted every single person who walked through the door, had a very nice smile and great suggestions. I walked out having completed at least 70% of my Christmas shopping and BF walked out with face products thoughtfully suggested by Anthony. I work in the healthcare industry and get many free samples for lotions and skin products. I'd rather spend the money and have such great retail encounters as I did with Anthony."
1,"Good decor and relaxed atmosphere.  Service was excellent - very friendly, engaging and attentive.  \n\nHad tomato basil soup to start which was quite good, and not served too hot.  Pulled pork sandwich was great, but the Kobe burger was better.  Will definitely be coming back."
0,"This place is a scam. All the reviews on here have to be from the staff or friends trying to get the place going. It is sketchy. It is in the same building as the strip club. I went with my girlfriend and no one was inside. Dead empty, pin drop stuff. First time Yelp has not worked for us. Beware. In my opinion the reviews are not real."
1,"Mosaic was such a pleasant surprise!\n\nYou know that sinking feeling you get when you walk into an expensive restaurant only to find pounding music and a crowd more worried about style than substance? That's what I was expecting when my husband told me we were going to some 'fancy' place in \""Scottsdale.\""\nBut I was totally wrong.\n\n This beautiful restaurant, surrounded by the desert and Pinnacle Peak, was quiet, romantic -- and yet laid-back. \n\nFirst, let's start off with the wine list. It was enormous, containing   wines from well-known wineries, as well as from smaller ones. It notes wines that are organic or grown using sustainable agriculture, etc.\n\nIn addition to meat and fish entrees, the menu offers a wonderful vegetarian dish for each course, which included choices like a potato, saffron and parsnip soup and a salad that had fennel, endive and olives.\n\nFor our main course, my husband had some entree of kangaroo loin and ostrich. While I, personally, couldn't really stomach the thought of him eating a kangaroo, he said it was delicious. I was surprised to see they actually had a tofu dish as an entree, complete with barley, gourmet mushrooms, veggies and a great sauce. Did I feel lame paying nearly $20 for a tofu dish? Yes. But was I pleased to see the chef was considerate enough to  remember vegetarians? Yes.\nFor dessert, we shared a citrus-almond cake. It was delicious. Absolutely delicious.\nI'd highly recommend this place. It's pricey, but with it's slow-food focus and its creative meals, it's one of those rare places that you feel is actually worth it. Also, the food was very healthy, and we left without feeling uncomfortably stuffed."
1,"Love this place! Great burgers, and amazing shakes. We've been going here for years and years, it's a must stop if you are in or going through Wickenburg. try the pineapple shake and of course a cheeseburger!"
0,Quality of food has gone down.  We went for dinner and were disappointed.  We have been here before so we looked forward to returning.  We will be going to Wynn instead.
1,"I'm a huge fan of Padre's! What food I've tried (I mainly just order tacos or their pork sliders usually) is delicious, the bartenders are awesome, and the owners are always friendly!\n\nOne of my favorite things to do: Order two tacos and half a bowl of guacamole with chips and salsa."
1,"If you are craving Dosa, this is the place to come. Not only do they have traditional Dosa, but they have creatively come up with 50 varieties to appease your interest. I went with the Masala Dosa with Garlic and Cheese.\nMy table got the appetizer sampler while were there. The Samosa was incredible. The others were meh. But that might have been based on my preferences as opposed to the actual quality.\nI would highly suggest grabbing some coffee at the end of your meal. It is fantastic here!\nAnd if, big \""if,\"" you have room left over, their Rice Pudding with Almonds was incredible!\nI can also appreciate that it was high quality food while remaining at a very reasonable price."
0,"Used hotwire to find a last minute deal when traveling through Madison. We generally aim more for Country Inn or Hampton... but this was the best deal.  At check-in I was told they only had king beds left,  though the parking lot was quite empty.  When we got to the room there were no sheets for the hide-a-bed. We went to the front desk and asked for some. We were told that the security guard would bring them up. 45 minutes later (it was close to 12:30 am at this point) we had to call and remind them. \n\nThe room was pretty rough. Lots of ding marks on the doors and trims. The light over the mirror didn't work. Things were just worn out.  The bed had clearly seen better days.  Crowne gives you these silly \""relax packs\"" with aroma therapy stuff.  A good bed would do more for making me relaxed. \n\nIn general I wasn't impressed.  We'll stick with Country Inn & Hampton inns."
1,"I really enjoy shopping at Ragstock.  You can find some very good deals inexpensively.  They also carry new items, which are too expensive to qualify as thrifty shopping, but are fairly reasonably priced. They always have fun and really different kinds of clothes, like brightly colored fishnet shirts or star spangled leggings, so you never know exactly what you'll find.  It's a good place to return for another visit."
1,"I LOVE THEIR DESSERTS because of their QUALITY.  As  Vancouverite from Canada, we have similar french passeterie cafes. The prices of Jean Phiippe desserts are reasonable  because the french pastisseries are normally priced like that even in Vancouver. However, J.P. Patisserie is beyong good quality. I don't know why? Is it because of the chocolat\u00e9 ? or I really do not know. I  I always drop by  whenever I am in Vegas  just to have their desserts. I should definitely try their chocolates next time."
1,"Second time we stayed here. Across street from Bellagio and Ceasar's. Great location. Hotel is only 4 floors. Out of your room and on sidewalk in 3 minutes.( Big hotels take 15-20 min. to hit street.) \n\nPositives: 42\"" flat screen T.V., Excellent and rapid heating/cooling and quiet, great hot water and skin stripping shower pressure (no dribble), swing open leaded glass window in shower and watch Bellagio fountains while showering (fresh air in room),ample drawer space, table with 2 chairs, for the price this is luxury!!!!\n\nNegatives: If room is up front near Strip and facing Flamingo Blvd. the traffic and tourist noise can be QUITE loud at night. Recommend facing Flamingo Hotel on other side of hallway.\n\nWill stay here again. This hotel is owned by Harrah's."
0,Was given a coupon for shakes and was excited to use them. Order at the drive thru and got to the window the young lady was rude. She told me I couldn't use two coupons. When I asked why she repeated the same thing. I said you didn't tell me why. She first said that she couldn't  do them both on one transaction. I asked if she could ring it separate. She responded with I am going to need you to come out to the front window. There was nothing on coupon that said you couldn't use the drive thru. I won't be back.
0,"Wow, what a disappointment! We read all the glowing Yelp reviews and were expecting amazing sandwhiches served at a local institution. After walking through a smokey casino, what we got was very overpriced, salty, small, mediocre salads and sandwhiches. Moreover, the atomoshpere is just one notch above a Subway.\n\nIn a reastaurant mecca like Vegas, there are better lunch options."
0,"Walked into this place and walked out. The owner/manager is a nutcase I feel bad for anyone who works for him, highly unprofessional with a jerk attitude for some reason he thinks mistreatment is a cool thing to do. I will never return and will not recommended this place to anyone. He gives small business owners a bad name!"
1,"Best Pho I've ever had in any state, and with no MSG.  Very flavorful and meticulously made.  I can understand why some of the other reviews felt that the service rubbed them the wrong way.  The owner is forthright and straight forward, and that is quite intimidating for many Contemporary Americans.  This place is not for the masses.  It's for those that want something special, and who can appreciate it."
0,"Very poor service. Required me to sign for prepaid gas when I did not want to. Manager said don't worry about signage and your contract saying you WILL NOT be refunded, trust us... \""we're Hertz\"". She was very aggressive. While I was sharing my concerns, the next customer was not required to prepay. Manager said, that was a mistake. Hertz requires prepay and I will deal with the salesman later. \n\nGood news! I cancelled my reservations and Enterprise beat the cost and picked me up. Very friendly and didn't try to make me prepay with no written assurance of no repayment. Thanks Enterprise!"
1,Fun place. Great view of downtown.  A lil tight on the parking. The french press coffee was fun...
0,"This place is total Ice Palace......so it is a great place in the summer.  Really....if I lived closer, I would just sit here all day and order H2o.  I came here with a girlfriend only because she had a gift card.  It is kinda of cool you can watch hockey practice here. It is a total sports bar so the set up with TVs, I really liked.  I notice the booths had their own TVs...that is really a nice setup!  Anyhow, we had salads....not a specialty place for that kind of food......this place is all fries, onion rings and burgers.  Our salads were  bland but  for 9-10 bucks ....GET THE BURGERS!  We were out of our element but we had 50 bucks to spend!  What's a girl to do?"
0,"I'm from Chicago and dying for some fantastic tasting ribs, other than those that I BBQ myself. Everyone pointed me to Honey Bear's BBQ.\n\nThe place is clean and casual, and the service is OK. But the ribs were horrible. The beer was fantastic though and I first thought maybe the alcohol had dulled my taste buds. I remember screaming, \""Either this is a poor cut of beef/pork or both animals had mad cow/pig disease!\""\n\nI decided to return and give them another chance, and not order alcohol. I ordered the ribs and again, \""Mad Cow Disease!\""\n\nI won't ever return. How does that go: \""First time shame on you, second time shame on me...\"""
0,"Location! Location! Location!  Sometime only location is not enough.  This hotel is in the middle of the strip.  But I can't find another good reason of staying there.  Everything is old and crappy.  Furniture, TV, bathroom, toilet, etc.  The room smells like old wood.  The \""do not disturb\"" sign was missing the first night.  We were very tired and didn't ask for a new one and we went straight back to bed.  We DID lock the door with the deadbolt tho.  But obviously it didn't work because the housekeeper knocked on the door at 8am and came right in while we were still sleeping.  The food in the buffet is ridiculous.  It's much worse than Old Country Buffet.  We got a okay deal on our rooms, I thought.  Now we still receive emails from them giving us free room.  It's just so bad that I will never go back to this hotel even the room is completely free.  Oh remember to check out the pictures of this hotel in the Yelp website.  The pic of the dead cockroach is just priceless!  That picture pretty much explains everything."
1,"Went into town christmas shopping and decided to pop down hanover street to see if we could find any good deals for lunch. La lanterna had a 3 course lunch meal for a very good price.\n\nWe had doughballs for a started and pizza and pasta for our mains. We halved each to try both options. The pepperoni on the pizza was underneath the cheese, so it was cooked but not burnt, never thought of cooking it this way before but it made a big difference.\n\nThe staff were very attentive and it was a lovely little quiet restaurant. Would thoroughly recommend if you're in town looking for a good meal. Only reason they have gotten 4 stars is because they only had tiramasu or coffee for the dessert option, and I don't like coffee so I was a bit stuck!"
1,"Was staying at the Golden nugget and this restatement looked very appealing. The happy hour is what stood out. Was one of the only places in the casino with a good HH. We had the calamari for an appetizer and that was delish! We also tried their homemade pizzas and a pasta dish. Both were so yummy and we really liked that they make the pizza in front of you at the bar area. For our Drinks we had beers and bellini's....which I luv well made bellini's. They were tasty! Overall we were satisfied with decor, staff, and food! Highly recommend if staying at the GN!"
0,"I wanted to like it so much, but disappointed! Just not tasty. Three of us shared the cheesecake and the chocolate peanut one (I forget the cute name), and at $6 a pop it better be the best dessert of all time- not even close!"
0,"Service in the dining room is just bad, especially for a restaurant of this supposed quality. Food is mediocre at best. As a local familiar with many of the fine restaurants in Vegas, I know I won't return.\n\nDon't go there. There are many other great alternatives, such as Vic & Anthony's in the Golden Nugget, Del Frisco's on Paradise Ave., (both are 2 of the best in the city), Brand in the Monte Carlo, Strip House in Planet Hollywood, Botero at Encore/Wynn. You'll get much more for your money at all of these and many others."
1,It has been over 2 years since my lasik and my vision is still 20/15.  I have gone to LVI for two annual exams and they are still polite and quick and a bit charming.\n\nMy husband went with me last month to get a free consult since he has worn glasses for over 20 yrs and contacts for the last 10 years.  The optometrist told him his vision is 20/20 and he needed neither surgery nor contact/glasses.  IT turns out his vision is actually a hair shy of 20/20 but contacts are not required.  I appreciate their honesty.\n\nI still recommend this place to EVERYONE.

1,"I live in Texas and my wife took a business trip to Verona.  She realized she left something very important at home, so I contacted a business in Madison to purchase it for her.  I contacted Union Cab for their courier service to get her item to the hotel. While I had some difficulty using their web site to place my order, Robert helped me get things done over the phone.\n\nHe also gave me a follow-up call to let me know that everything is processed and my package should be delivered on time.  I appreciate all the trouble he went through to help me take care of this problem.  He also let me know that he'd be working with his IT resources to make sure the web site works correctly in the future."
0,This Dairy Queen shows me that it can be worth it to check out yelp reviews for large chain restaurants.  I don't like going to Dairy Queen because it's so banal but banal would be an improvement for this Dairy Queen.\n\nIt was dirtier than my men's dorm room back in college (thankfully since I cleaned up my act) and I ended up paying for an expensive orange juice masquerading as an Orange Julius.
0,"Was just in there, solo, to chill out, eat some pizza, drink some wine and hang out. \n\nRandom drunk dude (at 8:30pm) approaches me and asks me if I want a shot of Jack (no). Proceeds to harass me about my haircut and ask me if I know his homeless buddy who, also, is from Seattle. \n\nThen he asks me if I have a problem with him? \n\nPizza to go please!\n\nI called the bartender after I left and told him he had a problem on his hands with that guy and he seemed receptive but, honestly, he should have sniffed that problem out right away.\n\nShit shouldn't get that weird in a place like that. There were families in there and I'm sure they weren't looking for a guy like that around them. \n\nFull disclosure; I like to party and I do like to drink and be inappropriate... a lot. Just not in someplace like that. Ain't nobody got time for that when there are kids around.\n\nPizza was OK out of a box at home. Drank a beer and jumped in the pool."
0,I've eaten gyros here before and really liked the lamb so when my Dad had a lamb shank craving I suggested this spot. We saw the pics on Yelp and my Dad was immediately sold. Unfortunately the pics that people posted were much more flattering. The lamb shank we received was bone dry and not the moist sauced one in the pictures. The gyros are still good but I would skip the lamb shank.
0,What are the meatballs made of?  My husband and I decided it is mostly bread.  We were disappointed in the food and very disappointed in the price.
1,"We were there for lunch on 10-31-13 and tried some dim sum and some dishes off the menu. \n\nDim sum - don't remember everything but the shrimp balls and the shrimp donut with noodle were great as was the pot stickers and coconut buns.\n\nMenu - salt and pepper pork chops, salt and pepper shrimp, beef rice noodles and Kung pow chicken were are excellent. Our favorite were the pork chops.\n\nThis was our first attempt at ordering dim sum so we were a bit lost however they tried their best to explain."
0,"Decided to try this place because it's closer to where I live than Aloha Kitchen. I quickly learned that AK is worth the drive. I had: the Kalua Pig & cabbage and the Kalbi ribs. The ribs were ATROCIOUS!!!  They were all fatty, full of grizzle and impossible to eat.  They were not tender at all. I gave up.  The Kalua pig & cabbage was tasteless; I'm not the type of person who puts salt on my meals, but I doused this dish with soy sauce to try to give it some flavor.  Had I been dining there (instead of ordering takeout), I would have asked for other dishes. No joke. Was not happy with the food overall, but they do have good macaroni salad."
1,"They really do make the best gluten free bakery treats ever. The artisan bread isn't my favorite, but if you ever have a chance to pre-order a baguette DO IT, they're great. So are the cupcakes, muffins, coffee cakes, pina colada cake and everything else. I hate cake pops in general, but the ones they make are pretty good.  The staff is always very nice and helpful. The prices are what they are, it's for gluten free products and they are good! Go buy a 4 pack of Udi's blueberry muffins for $8.00 and when you can't finish them because they are dry and unappetizing then tell me how big of a deal $3.50 is for a really great blueberry muffin. It's worth it. I have to spend more because I'm gluten free, although not by choice, but still it's worth it for a treat, it's not like I'm doing my month's worth of shopping here. If gellato on the strip is $8.00 for a scoop then what's wrong with $4.00 for a cupcake? I drive over from Centennial about once a month and usually can buy a box of something discounted from the freezer in addition to a couple fresh treats. YUM, cute and absolutely no possibility of cross contamination!"
0,"This place is a new restaurant Hong Kong style,but the food is no really good like everybody talking about..we order the curry fish ball.,they just put the curry sauce on the fish ball,the fish ball it taste nothing...and we ask for the desert on the menu.,,they don't have ..,if you don't have any desert,why you put on your menu??"
1,"I order from Napoli weekly. Their pizza is amazing, on point with great sauce and toppings. The wings are the largest and tastiest I have ever ordered. We have ordered the veal parm (excellent), chicken marsala (good), bruschetta (very good), baklava (good), Italian chopped salad (excellent), Philly Steak Bomb, (amazing), and like I said the wings with BBQ & a supreme pizza are our staples. I have never had an issue with delivery or pick up & the staff is always friendly. The largest menu and a great value."
0,"wow, where do I begin?  It took us an hour and a half to check in.  Our first room appeared to have been ransacked.  Beer bottle caps on the floor, the items from the cabinet were strewn all over the floor, beds unmade , towels everywhere, extremely dusty on the tables, a HOT mess.  The next room (which was an upgrade)  had been shampooed that morning, so the carpet was  WET....very WET.. tried to call the front desk and waited for over 30 minutes with no answer.  So, had to go back down to the front desk and  while they apologized, it took them about 15 minutes for them come back and tell us what we were going to receive.  (2 free buffet meals).  The service at the HOTEL in general was horrible.  From the front desk, the phone service, the waitresses at the pool, even the server at PRICE MARKET (the buffet restaurant).  The hallways were ALWAYS dirty.  This place is a hot mess. Yes, there are some perks... but geez, had to go through so much to receive them."
0,"I was moderately entertained watching all the drunk douchebags try to ride the bull during the Sunday night contest.  I was really hoping one of them would spew chunks, preferably on a spectator, but my wish wasn't granted.  I give them 2 stars because I discovered the aforementioned douchebags, who were wearing bandannas and sleeveless shirts (ugh), actually worked there.  My server, however, was cute.  So not a total disaster."
0,"Is there a \""no star\"" option? This place is a ridiculous joke. Dirty tables, dirty floors, rude service, and a $5 charge to use the bathroom for non clients? haha what? We wanted a quick cold drink and did not want a menu but it was forced upon us. There was nothing that appealed to me so I had some apple juice which cost $6 (it was a tiny dirty glass by the way) and my partner had iced coffee (which was crushed ice and ground beans poured into a small glass). It cost $14 for one glass of apple juice and an iced coffee. STAY AWAY FROM THIS TOURIST TRAP!"
1,Unfortunately I don't remember my nail technician's name but she did a fantastic job! I got a gel manicure and she made sure every single nail was perfect and smooth!!
0,I went to eat here today because I was in the mood for something different and did not want to go far. I should have stuck with Cheba Hut. I ordered a burger and fries. The burger meat was probably OK but whatever cheese they use on their burgers was disgusting. It tasted like the $0.99 cheese that you but when you are a few days away from payday and need something to go on your bologna sandwiches. I would highly recommend that you avoid this place. I have never been somewhere that screws up a simple burger this bad. Never eating here again.
0,"Ok burger... Bit pricey, odd atmosphere, slow service. Not the best place in Vegas for a burger. Probably not even in the top 20 in Vegas. Lame atmosphere also...feel free to skip this place and enjoy one of the many other great Vegas places."
1,"I know part of the experience is the customer serverice here, unfortunately we got our food to go, fried chicken with Mac n cheese, and grilled chicken with fries. We ordered teriyaki, buffalo, honey mustard, and BFG sauce. My favorite was the honey mustard and BFG for the fried chicken and teriyaki for the grilled.\nThe fried chicken is breaded and fried like fish and chips, it was really good, the mac n cheese seemed like Krafts with cheese on top and baked.. It was really good that way. Fries were awesome, found myself dipping them in the BFG sauce a lot! The garlic bread is not Texas toast so just expect French roll style garlic bread. I love Cane's chicken too what makes this stand out is the choices. I think I'll try the nachos next go around."
1,"Whipped in here for lunch today & got situated in a comfortable booth for my first ever visit to this Macayo's.  It's a big, very nicely styled place, & I ordered from the \""Mex & Match\"" special menu that's available on weekdays.  You choose 1 or 2 main items & 1 or 2 sides.  Right away (even though it was noon), my server showed up with a BIG bowl of chips & a cup of their TERRIFIC chunky salsa to get me started!\n\nI ordered a Chile Relleno & a shredded beef hard taco for my main items, & Tortilla Soup & veggies for my sides.  Soon my soup arrived, chock full of chicken breast meat, avocado, cheese, & more.  This also was VERY, VERY GOOD!\n\nAt the appropriate time my main platter arrived, with a BIG Pablano Chile, stuffed with delicious Oaxaca cheese, a good-sized shredded beef taco, & a large serving of steamed vegetables, including zucchini, broccoli, carrot slices, & red bell pepper.\n\nPeople rant that, \""Ooh, it's part of a chain!\"" or \""Ooh it's Gringoized, Americanized Mexican food\"", or whatever.  What a bunch of caca toro!  Get your burro & get over here ahorita, because this place is \u00a1CINCO ESTRELLAS, PERIODO!     :-))\n\nMex & Match with 4 items \u00a1precio barato! a $8.79."
0,"For how this park was revamped and the cool climbing stuff and spray pad, I give it a 5 star.  It's gorgeous.\n\nHowever, I give the people that go here and make it look like a trashy, ghetto place, I give you a 1 star.  We don't live near this area, rather in Gilbert and I've been spoiled by not only beautiful parks, but also the people that go there also have good behaviors overall.  They don't just throw there trash anywhere, but actually use the trash bins.\n\nWe did leave because there were people that looked up to no good and people smoking wherever we went.  It was a beautiful evening, but the fact we couldn't breathe because of all these people smoking.  Frankly, I don't have to deal with smoking at the Gilbert parks.\n\nJust because you may not have a lot of money, may be poor does not mean you have to act trashy, toss your trash anywhere and everywhere.  Here the city pumps in all this money to try to make the area look better, but without people acting better, in a few years, this place will look dumpy also.  What a shame.\n\nWe saw this plate of cake just sitting there on the sidewalk.  What the heck?  It wasn't a small piece of cake, but nearly filled the plate and looked partially eaten.  Who on earth would eat a piece of cake that is 6\""x8\"" big?  You can pick up the plate and walk it over to a trash can if you don't want it?\n\nThere were cigarette butts strewn near the play areas and the climbing areas.  That just sickens me when people feel it's okay to smoke those nasty cancerous sticks near areas where children play.  And, some of the people climbing on the rope things, they just had rude behaviors.  \n\nSo, basically we encountered more than we'd like ghetto behaviors.  So kudos for the city for trying to revitalize this place, but people with poor behaviors, leaving their trash all around, throwing their cigarette butts everywhere, they really bring down the place.\n\nThey should have fines for people who throw cigarette butts on the ground and trash fines for littering."
1,"anyone who reviewed this place must have not been to the original martoranos! Why this place wasnt packed when we went there on a saturday night is beyond me!\nThe food was the best! I know italian food and this was excellent! The staff was attentive and our waiter recomended the eggplant stack, the best app i had in all my time in vegas!!!! we shared the veal for our main and it too was excellent. \nThis place would do great if it was like the one on lauderdale. I wonder why it isnt. \n\nThis is real italian food, not the olive garden! i thought it was great!\nim shocked at the other reviews. and the prices werent bad for vegas"
0,"First bad sign is they didn't have milk  for our 3 year old. Second bad sign only one other family there. Third bad sign teenagers running the place sitting around texting and talking. \n\nPizza was mediocre and greasy. Caesar salad was made with old lettuce and all hearts. Honestly not impressed with it at all. I would rather eat Totino's party pizzas.\n\nThe bathrooms were nasty, toilet paper sitting on the toilet and the sink was falling off the wall."
1,What a wonderful place to visit. Especially at night during the holidays. This past holiday season the Chihuly exhibit was magical. Treat yourself and go.
0,"I recently moved to the area and found this place online, the reviews looked really good so decided to try it. In my past experience which had been amazing at Cage free grooming in Tempe, I know that it takes approximately 1 hour to do a full groom on my dog. I have had her for 6 years and been using the same groomer and this is how long it takes. Period. I am currently sitting in the parking lot waiting for my dog to be finished and it has been over 3 1/2 hours!! They tell me that they always tell clients 3-4 hours on a Saturday. What is the point of having a 1:00 appt if my dog is going to sit in the back in a cage for the majority of that time? If their regular clients knew how long it really took to groom their dog and how much less stress on them this process really could be, I'm certain they wouldn't use this place. Not to mention it cost me 10 more than I've ever paid. Will not EVER be using this place again. It doesn't even matter at this point if she comes out looking nice or not, my dogs comfort is way more important to me. Not to mention you can have Fields of Fur mobile grooming come to your house for abt the same price."
1,"im sorry---THE BEST BUFFET IN VEGAS HANDS DOWN....the prime rib at dinner, the seafood, the asian ribs and sui pork is to DIE FOR...the only bad thing i can say about it is ... the sushi selection was sad....maybe 5 different sushi selections and no sashimi ....was weird...but everything else was F**ING AMAZING...WELL WORTH THE 55.00 PRICETAG"
0,"3 hours, 15 minutes-- total time for an extremely simple physical. Stay away unless you have hours to waste!!!"
0,No bueno!! I dont recommend this place. Its no where near authenic mexican food.
0,Worst service ever - very unpleasant dining experience.\nThis local S-Hubert should be ashamed to try to overcharge the customer even before treating customers like inferiors.
0,"Food is great but service, not so good. Left my debit card which the server promptly turned in but when I called 3 hours later, the hostess quickly advised no cards had been left at lunchtime. It took my driving to the East Blvd location to have the bartender check the cash drawer to locate the card AND remember the server turning it over to her at lunchtime. Cost me a lot of time and agony!"
0,"Being a native Chicagoan my interest was piqued. The staff was very friendly and the place was clean.\nOrdered a Chicago style hot dog the hot dog was grilled,Chicago style is steamed as is the bun but the bun was wet and therefore was a soggy pastry mess, the fries were mediocre at best , the dipping sauce was very good.\n\nNeeds some changes in the food preparation and pray that Portillos does not open in the area."
1,"Oh Bev Mo how I miss you!!!\n\nI used to live five minutes from this location and would shop here at least once a week.\n\nBev Mo is an alcoholics paradise! They stock hard to find beers and wines that you won't find at most liquor stores. \n\nNow that I'm living in Central PHX I'm at least 15 minutes away from the nearest Bev Mo, so now I have to resort crappy, over priced liquor stores.\n\nI have always found the prices at Bev Mo to be great and cheaper than you can get at the grocery store or liquor store.  They have an excellent selection of booze."
1,This has to be the best hamburger I've had! I ate the whole thing (I'm a fatty). Onion rings and sauce were awesome. Nothing compares to the BBQ bacon cheeseburger. My hubby had the regular one and nearly finished his he liked it so much. If I ever crave a burger again this is the spot in South Phoenix. One less star because the last of my onion rings was too greasy.
1,"Gisteravond na de overweldigende reviews op Yelp hier gegeten. Goed, maar geen 5*.\n\nLief wilde per se een Pekingeend en ik wilde absoluut niet nogmaals bij Pearl eten. Eerder een zeer teleurstellende ervaring gehad. Maar dat is voor een andere review.\n\nLief had zogezegd de Pekingeend, ik de beef with asperagus and black pepper. Vooraf - weer ingestonken - pot stickers en fried shrimp. Zeg maar iets met ogen en maag. Way to much. Dat moeten we echt niet meer doen.\n\nWaarom geen 5 sterren? Eten was goed, uitstekend zelf, maar de service miste een beetje. Het was een drukke doordeweekse avond en mijn lief had eigenlijk de hele eend op tafel verwacht. Maar in plaats daarvan kwam er zonder overleg eerst de buns met het vel en pas na 10 minuten de rest van de eend. Minpuntje. We zijn weliswaar toeristen, maar willen liever niet ook zo behandeld worden.\n\nVerder uitstekend, en zeer betaalbaar. Was aangenaam verrast. Heb voor het eerst een doggy bag gevraagd. Zojuist de potstickers opgewarmd en ook dan nog steeds heerlijk.....Als je in Vegas bent: doen. KJ's Kitchen wordt zeker toegevoegd aan onze standaard to-do-list. Naast The Omelet House (Charleston), The Naked Fish, Craftsteak en Il Fornaio."
0,"So I'm in Arizona for business and I decide to look for a place to get a beer and a bite while watching the Angels-Red Sox game. I search for places nearby and see Elis is close by so in I go.\nFirst thing I see are three tvs on the side of the bar, each with a different game on and one of them the Angels game. Yes!!!\nI sit down and ask the 60-something barkeep what's on tap. Answer: nothing. Seriously????? Wtf????? It's a BAR how do you not have beer on tap. Oh man.....\nThey at least had Guinness in a bottle so  thinking \""OK, the game is on, food on the menu looks interesting, I'll hang around for another beer and some dinner then see how it goes\"".\n20 minutes later and I'm STILL waiting for the bartender to ask me about another beer. Well, was it busy you may ask. No dear reader, it was not. In fact, there were two old guys nearby who are locals and were helped straight away when they needed something. So I'm sitting there watching the old guy, a young guy and the two young girls who were working (hostess and waitress) chatting, talking, doing everything EXCEPT asking me if I want another beer. POOR!!!!!! Very poor....\n\nSo, why two stars? I was pretty much ready to walk right then and there, but another bartender came on and immediately asked me if I need another, after introducing himself and shaking my hand. Real nice guy, the kind of bartender you want in the place you go to regularly. So, I stay. Even got some food, a half order of tenderloin sliders which were not bad, along with a half order of sweet potato fries. The fries were decent and are thick steak style fries, not skinny shoestrings. The food actually got them a star right there.\nThe vibe of the place is interesting. I started reading the reviews of the place while I was waiting for the second beer and getting ignored. Saw a couple mentioning spotty, irregular service. Let's see: 20 minutes of being ignored, check. Younger bald guy walking around and looking at the Yankees game on one of the TVs when     He's not chatting up the waitress, check. Yeah, I'd say spotty fits. \nNext, clientele. I'm there for happy hour, and I'm the youngest person in the bar who is a customer. Of which there were 10. And I'm going into my mid 40s so there some old folks rocking it. But dammit, none of the cougars the place seems to be known for on other nights then the one I'm there. Hosed again....\n\nSo I finish my meal, the cool bartender takes my bill and drops a free shot on the bar for me, a vodka chocolate thing he calls dessert for me. Nice touch, and not bad. Another star for the total of two.\nTo sum up my long tale of woe: clearly a Monday night at this place during baseball season is not really happening. The food is decent but seriously, unless you're a local and have been coming here for a while, I can't see why you would walk in the door."
1,"Hey it's Dairy Queen, what more is there to say? it's always clean"
0,"Horrible experience!!! We went in around 11pm, when they were only serving their late night menu. We were told to seat ourselves, so we headed to a table right in the middle of the restaurant, next to, two other full tables.\n\nWe waited 15 minutes, no one came to our table, we watched 3 other servers walk by. After having to go ask someone up front to get our server, finally our server came by and got our order.. with no apology for the wait.\n\nWe ordered a burger and wings. Our burger came out wrong. Our server never came back to check on us.. so we pushed the burger to the edge of the table. Finally another 20 minutes later, he came by and asked how things were..\n\nAfter we told him everything that we were mad about, he never apologized or asked if he could do anything to fix it. Just said he would comp our bill, and walked away!!!"
1,"A group of six friends made a late reservation  for a birthday dinner, we were seated immediately and the magic began!! \nThe service was spot on the waitress was attentive yet unobtrusive. The food was fantastic especially the duck risotto with orange cream sauce! A must try if you are visiting Montreal-especially in the evening, the garden is amazing!"
0,"I was here about four years ago when a tall skinny man working there just blew up and started screaming at a customer.  I have no idea what happened, but it was one of the most terrifying bagel-related experiences of my life."
1,"NOTE:  I only just got my car back so I cannot yet comment on the long-term resilience of the paint job.\n\nMy wife bought a new VW Passat in December and was hit by a dump truck in January. There was body damage to the driver-side front door, back door and rear quarter panel. Our insurance is with Geico who has an agent that works right out of ABRA's office. So I took it there for an assessment.\n\nEveryone was extremely kind and helpful. The process of getting the estimate both by Geico and by ABRA was very quick and easy. Also, ABRA was nice enough to provide me with a rental car on their dime. Enterprise came out to ABRA's location and we took care of the rental there.  All I paid for was the insurance which was like $12-13/day.\n\nABRA sent daily updates via text message letting me know their progress and as soon as they had an estimated completion time, the let me know that as well.\n\nI dropped it off on Tuesday, January 21 and they completed all the repairs and paint on Friday however I couldn't pick it up until Monday, January 27 as the paint needed to dry.  The car looks excellent!"
0,Sandwiches are not that great.. .Fries inside the sandwich are soggy and the coleslaw is flavorless... Very overrated!
0,"Was with a group of business colleagues for a pre-set meal. The service was excellent, but the food left a lot to be desired. Chicken Piccata was flavorless and served on a bed of pasta that was even more bland. Others shrugged off their food (steak and Cannelloni)with a \""Meh, not so good.\"" I had expected much better.  Chocolate raspberry cake was yummy."
1,I love this place! I've been to Tessa for a facial and Casey for a massage. Both were excellent. I'm 8 months pregnant and I can't lay on my stomach obviously but they had a special pillow for massage I could lay on my stomach. They have really cute things for sell and I love the atmosphere.
1,"Tom Thumb's just opened up for business this past Tuesday. I filled my tank with premium for $3.65 versus the nearby Shells (yes all of the Shells have the same price) that was $3.75. It's good to get some competition in the area for a change. This place also has a carwash, BBQ Bistro, soft serve yogurt and a coffee bar along with assorted fresh fruits and veggies and the usual convenience store fare. My wife suggested to the manager that they should sell smoothies as well. The store manager seems like a good guy that will take suggestions so let's hope this place makes it."
1,The buffalo flavored dip is excellent and doesn't have MSG.  Unfortunately it is now discontinued.
0,"So I won't be back. The staff was friendly and nice, although they talk frequently to each other and their language, but that doesn't mean they were good. The lady that helped me gave me a horrible message, she failed to clean up around my toes, she missed all the corners/sides of nails. Over all I felt like they did half of the job. Plus the place was a mess and had very limited nail polishes. I suggest not going here"
1,I love the nostalgia of going to the ABC Stores - it brings back memories of Hawaii. I came here specifically to get plastic foam flower barrettes for myself and my daughter.

0,"We made 7:00 reservations for the day after Valentine's Day, so I went in to Amor de Brazil expecting a short wait, especially with a party of 5.  This was our first visit, and it was highly anticipated. We had been to Rioz in Myrtle Beach and really enjoyed the experience.\n\nWhen we checked in, there were 2 couples ahead of us.  We were told that our table would be available shortly.  The hostess kept leaving the host stand to check on different tables, wipes down and replace linens and silverware, etc.  While she was gone, the small foyer/waiting area filled up with people. After about 30 minutes, we were told that we could wait in the bar for our table, that people were taking longer than expected to finish their meals.  We went into the bar area - which was empty - sat at the bar, and were ignored by the bartender for about 10 minutes before she even acknowledged we were there.  When I asked for a wine list, she gestured to the restaurant seating area and said they were \""all out there\"" and handed me a cocktail list. Seeing that all of the cocktails and martinis were $8.75 and up, I chose to wait to have a glass of wine with my meal. An hour and 15 minutes after our reservation, another member of our party went to the hostess stand and asked if any of the empty tables were for us. We were told by the hostess that our drinks at the bar would be comped for our wait, and when I mentioned that I never saw a wine list, she said that she would comp all of the first round of drinks at our table.  \n\nWe waited about 20 minutes for a waiter to come by and bring us water, get our drink order, drop off the \""meat indicator\"" for the meat servers to stop at our table. No one ever stopped, and we tried to flag down the hostess 3 times and were promptly ignored.  Finally a waiter walked by and one of our friends got his attention and told him we had not gotten any service. He apologized, said he would take care of us, and brought out water for everyone, and I told him that the hostess had agreed to comp our drinks.  He looked at me like I was crazy, so I told him about the wait we had experiences.  He shrugged and didn't respond.\n\nWe went and got our salad bar items, which were delicious and plentiful. The variety was great - mussels, shrimp and salmon on the bar, as well as a variety of salads, cheeses, and sliced deli meats. The cooked meat was delicious - the tri-tip steak and lamb were both cooked perfectly.  I tried several other portions and enjoyed it all.  \n\nThe waiter never came back by our table to refill our water glasses or ask if we wanted another drink from the bar.  He was very attentive to the table next to ours - spending 4 or 5 minutes chatting with them, making sure everyone had drinks and everything they needed.  Almost 3 hours after our reservation time, we flagged down another server and asked to see the manager.  Turns out that our \""waiter\"" was actually the manager!  When we told him how disappointed we were with the service, he asked if he could bring us a dessert or another drink from the bar, which we declined, and asked for our bills.  He apologized again and brought us our bills.  Our drinks were comped, as the hostess promised.\n\nWe will probably never go back to Amor de Brazil.  The food was good, but the service was awful."
1,This new Thai RESTURANT is very authentic and everything I have eaten there is very delicious    The service is outstanding    I have eaten there several times  since it opened     I especially like basil fried rice  green curry   Duck noodle soup   Everytime I try something new and never disappointed    I will return soon very soon
0,"First off I want to say that I absolutely love Pita Jungle and I've been eating there for almost 10 years. This review is ONLY for this location. \n\nI've been coming to the Arcadia location pretty frequently over the past 6 months and I am extremely unhappy with the service. About a month ago my boyfriend and I went on a Saturday night. It was a little busy but nothing crazy. Our server took our order and then completely forgot about us. Someone else brought out our food and our server never checked on us even ONCE. I literally had to go track him down to get our check 20 minutes after we finished our meal. And the weirdest part was that he was taking care of all the tables around us... So ridiculous! \n\nThen we ordered take out a couple of weeks ago. We ordered a Mediterranean platter and a hummus and only got ONE pita! It sucks because we didn't realize this until we got home. Another thing is every time I call to place a take out order I'm put on hold for at least 10 minutes then when I go to pick up my food no one is even in the restaurant! \n\nNow what finally sent me over the edge was what happened tonight. I placed a take out order (after I sat on hold forever) for a LARGE hummus and LARGE garlic dip and what we got was ridiculous, there is barely any hummus or garlic dip in the containers. It looks like they took a small hummus and garlic dip and spread them out in a large containers (see attached photos). Then to top it off our pitas were completely cold and gross.\n\n\nI am so disappointed, I've frequented many of the Pita Jungle's in Phoenix or the years and I've never experienced anything like this. We will definitely not be back to this location!"
1,"This place is amazing the bread is so fresh. We had a sandwich combo there and it was great then took home a loaf of banana nut bread and wow so good. Also they give you samples so we tried the caramel apple bread and that was addicting. Also the Irish soda bread and peperoni bread was great also. Definitely a place to check out, there's 2 locations."
1,"Very basic class to have a speeding ticket removed. 4.5 hours went by ssssssllllowwwlllllllllyyyyy! You'd have to be a cyclops to read this slow!\nAnyhow, there is no video and the animation is lame. \n\nAll of the end of each chapter are questions which made up the 2 finals: (1) 25 question version on content and another (20 Question test on environmentals--- like what logo did you see on the page. It's all multiple choice and it's hard not to get 100%. \n\nWould suggest doing this all at once as it obviates the need to recall or re-study the materials. \n\nThese guys did not ding me for extra fees of third party identification. I'm guessing these are gone.\n\nThe school did not notify me that my delay from the Tempe Court and ticket were received, so it does require at least one phone call. \n\nOne last note: Arizona has some weird laws and interesting trivia like \""dust storms travel SE to NW\"". I'm not sure this is actually true, but the McCain-ites believe it, and it was in the trafffic school, and on the net....so, it must be true! :-)"
1,"Well, dont let the name fool you.............. this was a nice surprise . The food quite good, the onion rings were pretty damn good, served cold would have \""ROCKED\"" if served hot~\n   The place has a fun feel to it with the drawings & pick up lines on the walls .\n   The only issue were girl taking our order & serving the food. Both had issues keeping the orders straight... They were not busy and our orders still were not right however it was just a matter of getting the right food with the right sides on the right plates...... this would not put me off on returning. The girl who took our order was helpful on explaining the menu. The next time we are in the area we would come back if in the mood for a dog or wings."
1,"Very Nice Establishment. We enjoyed Dinner here which was simply a club sandwich and Duck sandwich, with bread and oil as a side, and we thoroughly enjoyed it. Great location too as not far from the shore. Service was good and very nice atmosphere. Loved the stained glass &  cosy, old fashioned interior."
1,"As others have stated, there are a ton of beer and liqueur  selections.  The recent addition of outside seating is a nice improvement!"
1,"Great food, super atmosphere, friendly service. The tacos are very  filling , start with two  and  add more if needed!"
1,"I always thought this place didn't seem appetizing from what it looks like on the outside, but it's actually cozy & welcoming! The service is quick & food is delicious...especially their banana nut muffins & ranch potatoes. I will definitely come back & recommend this place to my family & friends."
1,"I love this place! I don't know if its their style of ordering, the toasty delicious bread, variety of sides & drinks, location of being in Planet Hollywood, service, or just the sandwiches.. But this place is inviting & worth it. Their soups are even good. & they even sell beer!"
0,"Been coming to cafe rio for awesome fast Mexican food for years. Lived in Utah for a while...just like you Camilla k. I loved the ones in Utah and thought I would give this one a chance. The manager guy, don't know his name, is a total jerk. The food wasn't even warm. It was cold. My wife and I are sitting here right now and I'm so upset that I have to leave this review right now. Just awful service and not even good food anymore. Gradually getting worse. I'm going to costa vida from now on."
0,"We went to BJ's every once in a while because it was close and the food was decent. \n\nHowever recently service quality has seriously slipped. The waitress was cocky (not in a funny way - rather in an obnoxious way). \nThe beer took forever. I mean they have beer on tap why does it take like 20 minutes to get one even though the store was barely half-full? \nThe food is ok, but not great. A little overpriced too. \n\nProbably not going here again any time soon. They need to up their game."
0,"I just can't get as excited about Cold Stone as some of my friends.  When it first came out, everyone was all atwitter and so I felt I should be too.  I mean, it's ice cream and you get to pick all the stuff you want in it!  In essence, you're making it, so if it sucks, you have no one to blame but yourself.  But I don't blame myself, I blame sucky toppings.  I know for a fact that vanilla ice cream with brownies, pecans, caramel and fudge can be the most delicious thing ever; so when they're put together here (or at any Cold Stone location) and they suck, I don't blame the combo, I blame the quality.\nAlso, please help me understand this if you could: on the menu it says \""signature creations\"" and lists prices for all sizes, including kids.  Yet when I tried to order a kids size, I was told the smallest they could make it was \""like it.\""  First of all, no, I don't like it, second, why is it listed on the menu if it's impossible?  Am I too old to order the kids size?  If so, what the hell?  I should've said thanks but no thanks, but instead (because I could smell the waffle cones while I was eating my good for me salad across the way at 1130), I forged ahead with the \""like it\"" size, took five bites and threw it away.  That's a dollar a bite for mediocre ice cream.  And don't even get me started on the empty calories I blew through.\nNever again Cold Stone."
0,"First off, the food here is fine. Some of the stuff is pretty good, even. Upon first entering, there is a nice air to the place; well decorated, interesting menu, etc. \nThe problem here however is that the place is too aware of the positive. Every item on the menu is overpriced, and the staff have never been particularly attentive to me or my party in the several times that I have visited. \nI used to live in the southwest, and though I was very excited to see a frito pie on the menu, I was sorely disappointed by it. Not even real fritos! Had the consistency of stale deep fried tortilla strips. \nAs much as I wanted to like this place, I can't come here anymore, and not just because of its subpar frito pie...just kind of feel like I'm getting ripped off for some not all that great food."
0,"Popular, but very loud. Not a good place if you want to have a serious conversation, but the place is friendly and active.\n\nMostly student crowd, but with some diversity. Hard to find a place to sit especially if you are more than 2 people.  Beer selection is okay, but not amazing. After all the positive hype I was disappointed by the selection where the highlight is on their custom brews."
1,Food is really good and drinks also. It is a first time I had food on Pa. Prices also not bad. I heard they have couple locations here. I wish they were in MD
0,"7/8 - Went through the home warranty company on a rental for a blocked sink.  While it could have been in their contract with the warranty company to do the minimum required they took ten minutes to look at the sink (doing the minimum required effort)  indicated there was no clean out and they wont be able to help at a cost of $75 dollars for pointing out the obvious, if it was easy I could have fixed it.  Would not recommend under any scenario.  Went with RAM pluming and they took care of it with no complaints that there wasn't an easy solution, problem fixed and warrantied for 6 months.\nUpdate 7/18:  Home warranty company agreed with me that Athena did not put forth the expected professional effort and agreed to reimbursement the $75 deductible plus cover some of the cost incurred to hire another company.  Do not use these people..if my warranty company agreed to reimburse me which by contract they have no obligation to do so since I did not go through their dispute department but acknowledged after talking to the company that fixed the problem that the Athena employee was either inept, incompetent, or just lazy proves or at least supports my impression of Athena's unprofessional and incompetence."
0,"first...hair found in sushi roll. second...screaming children. EVERWHERE. third...food was flavorless (except the 911 roll, which was very spicy and the best part of our meal).\n\nservice was ok. until it got busy, then we felt ignored.\n\nso much for fusion sushi. we won't be returning."
1,"This is a really good place to hang out and get frozen yogurt. They have a nice variety of frozen yogurt flavors available, and a ton of toppings available to add.\n\nMy only reason for giving 4 stars instead of 5 is that they are kind of expensive as they charge by weight, so it is easy to rack up a $5 yogurt if you're not careful."
1,"Came in here three times during a week long trip because they are a devoted football (soccer) bar.  I was very excited to see multiple Spurs fans in attendance, although losing 4 to nil stung a bit.  \n\nOn a more serious note, this is a very good bar.   The only food I had was a delicious and gargantuan boxty that was easily sharable between fifteen people.  All three bartenders that served me were very cool, quick, and knowledgeable about the draft beers.  My only complaint was that they had no Power's whiskey."
0,"Been here 3 times and in last 4 months. My wife who loves chicken wings has not finished her order twice.  First time we ordered them fried, dry dry dry. Second time grilled, dry dry dry. What the heck  even after dipping them in extra sauce plus ranch you guessed it, dry dry dry. The burgers are average at best. The friends we dined with said the same comment, average food. Nothing to write home about. Our servers Kyle and Big Deb did give us Good service. We attend a monthly car event there so we want to patronize the business, but next time we will eat before we get there. On average plan to spend at least $33.00 for a dinner for 2 not including tip. We ordered  a burger with fries an order of wings and two ice teas."
0,"Stayed at this hotel during a quick overnight trip to the Henderson area.  I booked a standard room on Kayak.com for a total of $77.86.  At the particular time (it was Spring Break), that was a fairly inexpensive hotel for the area.\n\nThe front receptionist was exceptionally nice when I arrived at the hotel, but that's where the positive points of my stay ended.  It was late, and she said I was the last of the guests to check in for the night.  When I arrived at my room, it turned out to be a smoking room.  That was not what I reserved.  When I called the front desk to see about an alternate room, the same lady who initially greeted me answered.  This time, she was less than friendly and curtly replied that the hotel was booked and there was nothing she could do.  She said that she was quite certain that my reservation had been for a smoking room, even though I protested.  She even blamed it on Kayak and said that she had seen mix ups like that before.\n\nDespite the fact that I had a copy of the confirmation email and it clearly states \""Non Smoking\"" room, I had no reasonable option but to stay in that cesspool.  It was too late to find anywhere else to stay.\nIf you're staying in the Vegas area, there are plenty of really cheap hotels if you don't mind staying in a casino.  This isn't one of them - $59 on weeknights, $69 on Friday and Saturday..  However, it is right around the corner from Kate's sister and brother-in-law in Henderson, which is the only reason we go to Vegas to begin with.\n\nThe high speed internet was free and did work, but the breakfast was a disappointment.  The hot breakfast included sausage, orange-ish eggs, DIY waffles, and some sort of rubbery potatoes. Plain bagels and a couple of cereals were available.  Instead of choosing to challenge my GI system with suspect breakfast, I grabbed a mostly green banana, some apple juice, and split the next morning.\n\nThis hotel clearly is not looking for repeat customers with the lack of customer service that they exhibited.  My advice, keep looking, even if that means paying a few bucks more."
0,HOMOPHOBES!!!!! Over priced drinks! The door and bartenders are rude. If you look gay they won't treat you good! I will not go there again. This was two incidents there my girlfriend and I then my girlfriend and her friends last nite. Rather go to Dont tell mama and be treated better.
0,Equipment issue rested in delay. Finally got on plane. Funny noise. Stuck on tarmac. Then back to gate. Now sitting in terminal for 90 minutes. According to tracking system we have landed in San Antonio. Just got text from airline saying we are leaving at 9:50. Gate agent hasn't got a clue. This air line is the worst.
1,"My husband and I love this place.  We've been to it in Hawaii and it's just as fresh here in Chandler.  The wine list is great.  The menu changes seasonally and local chefs are allowed to change a few things around but you're safe with absolutely anything on the menu.  Except maybe the scallops which I persist in ordering even though they make my stomach crazy.  Okay, granted I get the big-d with like every meal I eat but still, the food is rich and tasty and I can't resist.  I highly suggest trying: \n\nAnything macadamia nut-encrusted \nShrimp Pad Thai\nWaimanolo salad\nKalua duck spring rolls\nKai beef short ribs\nButter seared scallops \nButterfish\nBlackened ahi tuna\nMELTING HOT CHOCOLATE SOUFFLE\nETC.\n\nThis is a great date spot, especially if you go in the cooler months where you can sit outside by the tiki torches and fire pit, listening to the traditional Hawaiian music they pipe outside.  It's dreamy."
1,"This was another stop on our pub crawl and I only had one drink here so I don't have too much to go by for rating, but they had a nice selection and the cider realler hit the spot.  They had a nice big patio outside that accomodated a ton of us and when the birthday boy was ready to leave, the waitress tallied everything up nice and quick."
1,The place is colsed. Locked up tighter than a drum. Word on the street is dispute with land lord and holding back rent.

1,"I'm craving a Tinga taco just writing this review.  I love Cien Agaves' tacos!  You can order them individually, as part of a meal with beans and rice, or a platter of 10 for $35.  Pork, carne asada, chicken, potato, lobster..you name it, they have it.  Whether you like mild or spicy, are not a meat eater, whatever... You'll find the perfect taco for you.\n\nTheir patio is basically a narrow walkway with wobbly tables.  That's the only negative here in my book."

1,"this is the third time i've had permanent eyeliner done and by far this is the best. nelly is wonderful and my eyeliner is amazing. she's gentle and the line she created is perfect. she applies a topical anesthetic, allows that to take effect and then begins the process. don't let the thought of any discomfort put you off. nelly takes great care to be fast and the anesthetic takes care of the discomfort. it should last about 5 yrs - and if you're active, you can get up in the morning and have magnificent eyes by just waking up. no fussing with a pencil or brush and the best part it doesn't rub off when you swim, ski or do anything that makes you perspire. perfect eyes 24/7. you won't find anyone else better."

1,"For all those griping about the tax subsidies for the light rail, Phoenix needed a light rail system, just like it needed I-10, 202, 51, and 101, and a big airport too; pretty much all paid for with our tax dollars. You paid for those extra lanes of congestion even if you never drive one of those roads. We all did. \n\nAre they all perfect and to everyones liking? Of course not. We're either a growing city or a dying one, so keep on expanding the system I say. \n\nI've enjoyed riding it when I can i think it's a source of pride for our city.  I give it four stars for the cool factor, of finally having a public transportation system that I would actually use. [Train vs. bus] I only hope the system will connect more shopping hubs, schools and the sports arenas in Glendale one day."
1,"I'm such a fan of the uber casual dinner I had here last night!!!  I had this nagging urge for a chicken sandwich and the Burger Bar provided it well.  My picture looks like a rainbow of colors thanks to the carrot/celery \""add\"" option!  The bread on my sandwich was squishy and fresh, the portion of chicken was huge and the fries were a perfect compliment of crispy heaven.  The price was right and the service was happy.  Thank you Burger Bar for not only having chicken on the menu, but doing it right--you were exactly what I needed!"
0,"This review is not pertaining to the services I received from Djanel. Unfortunately, I did not even make it that far into the business transaction. I called to schedule a massage because I had heard and read positive things about Djanel Spa. Further, the prices were reasonable compared to most of the hotels/spas. While making the appointment, I informed the person I was speaking to that I preferred a female masseuse. He replied that he did not have any female masseuses available for 5 weeks because he had conventions and weddings to attend to. Peculiar, I thought, but no problem, sir. \n\nI told him that 5 weeks would put us into the month of January and I would be happy to schedule an appointment with a female during that time. He replied that he could not promise anything especially a female masseuse and that he does not schedule appointments that far ahead. He stated that he would not even want to \""promise a glass of orange juice\"" that far ahead. He went on stating that it should not matter who gives me a massage and that I should be happy with whomever I receive a massage from; \""I have been in business for over 25 years and this is not a normal request...\"" At this time, I simply stated that I would take my business elsewhere.\n\nJudging from what other people have stated, this is a solid spot to receive spa \nservices. I was disappointed that I could not experience \""25 years of business.\"" Instead and judging from context, I received an earful of metaphors and anecdotes from the owner."
1,"This is one of my favorite Mexican fast food restaurants. It's clean and cool in the summer. It's neal the theater and my house. You can alway ask for more meat without extra charge. Of course, they will charge you if you ask two spoun more. :-)\n\nThe parking space is not as big as the store and it's crowed over the weekend."
0,"I do not recommend Death Valley. My first time ever at this cafe. I was recommended by a friend. However, I must say right off the bat, it was worst experience ever at a cafe for myself. I went in Friday night to be greeted by a really rude girl who when asked questions made you feel stupid. The thing about this place is that they are fairly unique, when asking for a recommendation I don't need a sarcastic answer. I had before ordering just walked out as I couldn't handle it. I will recommend people against it, as it us not worth it at all when your initial impression is so negative."
0,"For a city that embodies glitz and glamor, you would think the airport would be a little bit nicer.  Out of all the places I have flown in and out of, I think the Vegas airport is one of my least favorite airports.  \n\nDismal food choices, cramped conditions, and an abundance of slot machines makes this place a horrible spot to be stuck in.  Looking out the windows during my layover to CA, I remembered the food I had on my last trip.  Wonderful, over the top and memorable, my mouth began to water.  Here I looked around the airport and what did I end up settling for....Sabarro.  Ick.  The charging stations were packed so I had to find a outlet on the wall and sit on the floor and the inside of the airport is just a poor reflection of what Las Vegas is.  When you fly into Nashville, you get the feeling of Country Music or even Providence you are greeted with ocean feelings.  You get nothing at the Vegas airport.\n\nThe only thing that I do like about this airport is maybe Ethels....if I want chocolate and that Southwest has a hub here."
0,"Food is consistent and never bad, but if you are coming in to enjoy a big sporting event on one of the many TVs, you will most likely be disappointed. I guess the in-house dj, who sounds like a Spotify Pop Muisc Playlist, is more important than the national championship game between WI and Penn State V-Ball game. When 75% of the bar is in red and here to watch the game, put on the sound. Also had to deal with an altercation between a bartender and my girlfriend when asking to turn on the sound for the 2012 World Series. We were told 'our sound system doesn't allow multiple sound inputs between the bar and dining room'. Then that same bartender complained to a patron about how 'if you wanted to listen to the game, you should have stayed home.' I thought this was an isolated incident. Obviously not. The Great Dane does not care about the customer experience, unless it's inline with what they think is appropriate.   Sorry, your dj sucks and we would rather listen to the sports commentary. iTunes is as good as this guy."
0,"Purchased a pair of shoes and decided to return it. They refused my return based on the fact that they were worn and they could not resell them. I bought the shoes 4 hours earlier, went home to try it on with socks and decided it didn t work. When I purchased it, they were slightly dirty on the sole which I just assumed was from others trying it on. I m not nitpicky and it was the only pair in the size that I needed available. If they are unable to sell used shoes why did I manage to get a pair out of the store AFTER the associate looked them over?? Maybe FF should consider leaving a sample size of each shoe for you to try on then you ask for a brand NEW pair that s kept in the back?!?!"
1,If u don't what to travel to shady side walnut street Starbucks go to the one in east liberty. You will have the same great feeling. I been going there since it first open it's doors. But I do still go to the mama and pa coffee houses in the area too. Long live East Liberty!!!
1,"Grimaldi's is one of my top pizza places in Scottsdale. Fresh ingredients, thin, crispy crust,  amazing flavor. It has a distinctness all it's own. When you are craving pizza you think \""I want pizza\"" or \""I want Grimaldi's pizza\"". It's just not like the others my friend. \nDecor is typical pizza joint restaurant-red and white checkered tablecloths, simple furniture for their tables and chairs, some black and white photos on the wall. Every time I've been here it's been crowded and typically service is attentive and friendly."
0,"I called this store to inquire if they had a Canon EF 50mm f/1.4 USM in stock.  They said they had a few.  I asked if they could get anywhere close the amazon's price.  He asked how much they were selling it for, and i replied $339.   He then started yelling at me that they are losing $40 on the lens, and good luck.  He was rude started bitching to me.  I asked could you do any better, and he basically said good luck and hung up the phone.  \n\nGet with the program.  The price of the lens is $399 retail.  Don't tell me you only make $20 on a lens sale.  I want to support local businesses, but I'm not going to drive 20 minutes to over pay for something I can have overnighted to me for $60 cheaper.   What is really ridiculous about the whole thing is I also ordered a $1100 L glass lens from amazon as well, which I paid full retail for.  They could have had both orders, if he didn't treat me like sh*t. \n\nIf you want to survive as a local business, you need to be nice to your customers.  If you don't want to price match then be nice about it.  Don't try to bully someone into  buying something.  If you know a customer is just going to order it, I think you would be better off selling it and only making $20, then losing that business and any future business from the customer.  I have personally spend thousands upon thousands of dollars on photography equipment, always the highest end lenses, and camera bodies.  In fact I bought my last camera body at their store, but I will never make that mistake again.  \n\nYou lost my business for good, and I am sure I will not be the last one."
0,"Horrible Customer Service.  If I could give ZERO stars I would.  \n\nI have a sofa which has had to go back three times now to repair a seam on the back frame that keeps splitting open.  It came back the last time with the seam repaired however the seam is now crooked and looks horrible.  My case got escalated to the Supervisor level (finally) and I was told yesterday that they feel it has been repaired correctly and there is nothing else they can do for me.  I might not care so much if the sofa was up against a wall, however it floats in my room and the crooked seam is constantly visible.  All other seams on the sofa are perfect.\n\nI am very disappointed that Living Spaces is not going to make this right by me.  I paid $1700.00 for a sofa that has a visible crooked seam that they tell me has been fixed appropriately.  I have had guests in my home ask me what happened to my sofa.\n\nI have been very patient throughout this process (it had to go back three times for repairs), but now I am extremely upset.  I will never shop here again, nor will I refer anyone else ever again to Living Spaces.\n\nAnd when my guests ask me again what happened to my sofa I won't be as kind in my response to them.  I will flat out tell them this is what Living Spaces considers to be an appropriate repair."
0,"I have been to this restaurant a few times.  Every time we were there because we were looking for places to dance (my workout exercise).  Every Saturday night, they have salsa, bachata music for a few hours.  We normally got there early at around 9 pm.  Right, the customers had never been close to ten each time.  I always like to have red wine, desert and snack.\nThe crowd will not come till around midnight when they change the music to reggaeton then you will see hundreds of young people flood into the restaurant.  There were not enough seats for everyone and there was no room to walk thro'.  People are drinking and dancing within the limited place. Doubted if they just love that jostling feel.\nNormally once I see the crowd, we will start to leave.  There are always police around the parking lot.\nOn a Saturday last month, without knowing they called celebration of Columbia night, we went down in a whole family of four as we had children visiting.  Out of my surprise, they charged $15.- per person just to get in.  No drink, no nothing.  It was my friend who did not want to upset the party, he paid for it.  What?  $60.- to just get into the crowd with no seats.  Later he found some friends who gave us a few seats.  Honestly I was not happy at all.\nThe floor is carpet.  Price of the drink is above average.\n\nI talked with many of my friends, everyone said $15.- entrance is outraged.  Even I never have to pay, I still consider not a place for me.  I know they do charge for entrance, check out before you go unless you do not mind."
0,"the cashier yan lee was a great young man, but i am utterly disgusted with this establish. i purchased a dozen and a half donuts, to take to work for some customers. to myself embarrassment, a customer found a live mealworm in her donut. after tossing the few remaining donuts, i was trying to comfort the customer & had a coworker call the store to speak to the manager/owner (not sure) rose. rose called back requesting all the donuts & showed no empathy. yes, i received a refund. working in customer service, i feel more could have been done. there was no attempt to even try to keep me as a customer. i won't be returning to that bakery, not even for a drink."
0,"Well, a lack of quality fish is not the problem here. The problem seems  to be the overly fancified menu & the long, long waits it causes.  They could seriously pare the menu down a good 15 items and you'd still have plenty to choose from.  \n\nThat being said, the food was okay.  I had a lump crabcake melt.  The crab was mighty tasty but the cibatta roll was dense and tasteless.  Also, tiny side scoops of coleslaw and rice/garbonzo bean salads were very sour.  Thankfully, I had a small bowl of mushroom brie soup which was delicious... but of course tiny & a bit overpriced.  Originally I had wanted some sushi but was told there would be a 40 minute wait, this was at 11:45 am.\n\nIt's a gorgeous place & the staff seemed friendly enough but I have no idea what was going on in that kitchen.  2 people making sushi and 4 people bustling around a convection oven & a bunch of sauces and garnishes.  \n\nBummer indeed for this fish-lover."
1,"This is the convenience store attached to the Shell Gas station where I usually fill the cars up. It really is convenient since it's down the street from where I live, in the same area as the supermarket, Rocco's, the dry cleaners and across the street from Discovery Park.  They also have a Post Office Express inside, in case you don't feel like making that trip to the Post Office."
0,First stop in AZ on our way to Wigwam. Service was lax - seemed to be more concerned with getting ready for dinner. The cook would come out and sit at the bar when there were no orders to drink her soda. Food was ok - nothing to make you go back. Lots of tv's so we considered going back to catch a ball game.
0,"Did NOT check the reviews prior to going last night.  \n\nAs others have said, \""vintage\"" seating -- meaning truly uncomfortable.   We moved FIVE times before finding something we could endure.  \n\nTHREE times I left the theater to ask the staff to focus the projector.   The last time they ignored me.  And the projection quality was horrible: flickering throughout.  \n\nThe staff?  More interested in sitting with each and chatting.  \n\nNo \""I'm sorry\"" or any other apologies when I asked to have some focus the projector.  Just a mumbled \""we'll fix it\"" from the old man in a tie.  \n\nAwful.  The worst movie-going experience I've ever had.  And people wonder why the small movie houses are dying?  They have NO concept of customer service.  This place could be such a gem if they cleaned it up, fixed the seats and upgraded the projection equipment (or at least monitored it).  \n\nInstead?  $9 for a miserable experience."
0,Marquee is a good nightclub in Vegas. Great venue. It's new and trendy. But it's over crowded. Dance floor is small. I like how you can go outside and inside. The main room plays too much house music. Had a friend who was on the guestlist and still paid 80 dollars to get in. Its a great experience if you have a table and If you want a table you have to book months in advance. It's good to experience this type of environment once in awhile but it's not a place I would go to regularly.
1,"Since last visit, I have sampled:\n\nchicken curry- w/ roti;  good solid yellow curry, I prefer more heat myslef, but it's good for the masses... roti is served Chinese see-tyle, like a pancake....ask if you want more crispy, they will fry it longer.....\nBIG portion! I barely finished it and had food coma later.\n\nfried porkchop- thinly fried filets of pork, with a special gravy for dipping...had to get extra gravy cuz i poured it all over the rice, yummmm.\nif you want more pizazzzzz, ask them to make it with the salt n pepper batter...that's how Wai makes it for himself....\n\nas always, friendly service, i feel more like friends or family.... we always talk about food or New York or whatever.....\n\nfor any new readers, this place is solid and the prices can't be beat.....there is no other joint like this in town, at least with a variety menu like this.....\n\nso come and try it....you'll like it\n\nif it's not Big Wong then it can't be right....\n\nC"

1,"I can't comment on the laundromat side of things since I've never used them, but as far as a cafe goes, I really enjoy coming by this place. The food is good, and I've actually had some nice conversations with the staff, never felt cold. They recently started doing pizzas which are pretty delicious (choose your own toppings, cheeze, and meat) and I love the woody environment and terrace. Only knock I have is that service can be very slow when busy, they seem a little understaffed at times."

1,"On the first and third Thursdays of the month, Ben Avery offers lessons for women. You get to take three classes for free (skeet, trap and sport). And by free, I mean COMPLETELY FREE. They give you a box of rounds, shotgun rental, clays, ear/eye protection and awesome instructors. After your first 3 lessons, you can continue to join the class, but you have to buy your own clays and rounds.  \n\nFred the range master (in charge of the program) is awesome and so is LeRoy (he's in charge of the first-time visitors). And the ladies from Desert Rose that instruct the return visitors are so helpful. \n\nMake sure you sign up in advance for the classes though. Space is limited."
0,"Let me start this off by saying that this whole pool party thing really isn't my scene. I'd rather lounge by the regular pool and have a decent-ly priced beer, or just drink in my room prior.. However, I was on vacation with my sis and she wanted to go, so I got us presale tix. \n\nWhen they recommend getting to a place in Vegas early, follow that advice!! We were there a little after 10:30 and really didn't have to wait more than 10-15 minutes to get into the actual pool. I can understand checking bags, but taking gum? Really? I'm surprised they let you bring your own sunscreen in. This particular day (Sat, 8/24/13) was overcast, however the part in my hair still got burnt as we were there until 3:30.\n\nThe only reason I gave WR 2 stars is due to the 2 decent guys that came up to ask about my tattoos and ended up chatting with us for a while, and even getting us the majorly over-priced ($32.50) drinks in the souvenir cups. \n\nAfter getting into the actual pool area, I was surprised at how small it was, seeing as how well known it is. We didn't know where to go as we didn't have a bed/cabana reserved, so the staff member told us people just line up around the pools.. As I said, we were there early so we took up a place on the edge of the warm pool. My sis got us 2 frozen drinks- $17 each, which tasted like there was zero alcohol in them. At least the $32 drink was strong and had 4 types of liquor involved. As the day went on the pool just got more and more crowded, people dancing and splashing girls who were dancing. No way would I spend more than 3 seconds in that stew of STD's. On one side of us was a bachelorette party which had a bride that looked like she was going to puke after only a few hours of being there.. All around there are girls in heeled shoes, wanting to be looked at, and guys with shades on trying to look cool. No thanks. \n\nWhile in line for the bathroom I saw a girl slip and fall on the floor.. Not sure how drunk she was.. Later on my sis went to the bathroom and when she came back to us, her wrist was crooked and she said she fell.. We got security who actually got us to the medical station in a couple minutes, and the staff there gave her a splint and the address to the hospital.. After the 4 hours there, having her fractured wrist set back in place,she is now having surgery next week to repair the damage. \n\nFor a place that is obviously involving intoxicated people walking on wet surfaces, I would think there would be actual precautions taken to provide traction on the floors, but alas there was nothing."
1,"Great service from the start!  Natasha was our server and took great care of our family.  Just about a half hour before, we walked out of another Texas Roadhouse (see my other review) for non-service.   This one was the opposite!  Plus the food tasted better to me than our usual Texas Roadhouse in Peoria (which we love!).  Kudos for getting it right!!"
0,"Charges charges charges! Please do not stay here! from tipping the lady to make ur pull out bed because they don't have double beds in the hotel room to tipping for valet because the don't have self parking to paying extra everyday to get on the strip because it's not on the strip to paying for a ridiculous resort fee of $20 per day. I have stayed at hotels in las Vegas that were on the strip that had better atmosphere amenities and best of all price even though they might not be 5 stars! Trump is basically trying to act like a 5 star hotel but they don't have the structure to back it up except for they provide all these services to you that they make u do. For example, they give u a $25 credit to their spa as part of their $20 resort fee a day, which means I probably have to spend a hundred dollars worth more in the spa just to  get my money's worth for being charged a resort fee. Furthermore, the pull out sofa bed is not 5 stars. It is very uncomfortable! Although I have to say my sister's bed which is the reg king size bed in the room is not that bad. Both me and my sisters woke up to a train this morning at 7am sat. I read this in the other reviews but one reviewer assured me this was not the case. Yes, the train does come and it is loud enough to hear it! It is loud,  but is gone in a couple of seconds, but I assure that u will wake up! Furthermore it is very close to a highway which is currently my 24 hour background noise. I can still sleep through it but its trying to fall asleep which is the problem. My advice is play it safe and stay at a hotel on the strip. If u aren't rich, but just want to have fun with ur family in Vegas this place is definitely not the place to splurge. FYI, the finishes in the room is nice and luxurious but even though this place just opened, u can see that some areas especially the tables and couches r beginning to worn out."
0,Went with a large group on a Friday evening. The group reserved the entire back area so we could be together. The restaurant only had two people assigned our area (we had at least 100 people and over 15 tables). We personally waited 15 minutes just to get our drink order then we placed our food order and waited well over an hour for our food. By the time we received our food several of the tables in our group decided to leave and go to the Cook Out to get better service and actually have their dinner after finding out that the order they had placed over an hour earlier hadn't even been started yet in the kitchen!!! The management knew we were coming well in advance yet chose to schedule a light staff in the dining room and in the kitchen. The food was mediocre at best and I only gave it one star because zero stars was not an option.
1,"I thought this place rocked.\n\nWe made dinner reservations for a Friday night for a table with a view.\nWe were in the inside portion of the mansion with a large party.\n\nThe food was great, views were great, drinks were great.\nMy favorite part was being handed a glass of sparkling wine as we entered.  Yay!\n\nAfter dinner we explored the house.  Then we moved to the lounge and found a very, very entertaining and maybe drunk lounge singer (think of the band at the end of the Hangover movie)\n\nI would definitely return for a fancy brunch or special night out."
0,"I don't care for Samurai Sam's based on the very few times I have visited. The food is sad, oily and the portions are skimpy for the price point. \n\nThis location was empty even during peak lunch hours, that says something."
1,This place has authentic Mexican cuisine. I came here with my sister who has been talking about the wonderful food here.We tried the vegetarian fajitas and Mexican stir fry. Both were delicious. Their tortila chips were served hot and the salsa was a little different but okay. The servers were courteous and the service was pretty quick. I will visit this place again!
0,Didn't have a chance to try the food. The staff was extremely rude and we decided to go somewhere else. Ended up finding an amazing breakfast place down the street called DW Bistro. Go there! Avoid this small restaurant with rude staff!
0,"DO NOT I repeat DO NOT go to this location! I usually go to the one on frank Lloyd wright because that's right around where I work,but I live near this one so I thought I'd try it out. First off the aesthetics of this one are quite displeasing and unfriendly. The retail here is a better selection but I would buy my lotions online if I were you. I got a mystic tan for the first time and it turned out a nightmare!! It was extremely streaky and a bit orange-y. It felt as if the machine was only spraying one side of me and sure enough it looks that way too. I also had to blot dry a couple of areas because it didn't dry while in the machine. Needless to say I'll be going back to versa. I definitely feel like the staff was unfriendly and like I was waisting their time just by being there. If I could give them 0 stars I would..."
1,"My dad & brother enjoyed ale & Boston loger. Great food: the biscuits are different than any other I've had.. they're good (w/cinnamon & sugar). Tri tip, mac & cheese, & the bbq burger are all yummy. Had an awesome server: Joe. Love the spaciousness & the art on the walls. :)"
1,"I have always heard about the Spice Market Buffet at Planet Hollywood and I finally got the chance to visit. It is located after about a half mile walk from self parking through the Miracle Mile Shops past the casino, so be ready for this. Once you get there, I went for dinner, the line is usually about an hour plus.\n\nAfter getting a seat, you have to take a few seconds to see where to go for which food station you might want. There are always a lot of people eating here so decide if you want American or Mexican food for instance first. A plan will help you out.\n\nI visited the American, Asian and Italian sections. Almost everything I had was sufficiently hot with the exception of a few. I expect that the food, once it is put out, is almost immediately consumed, so the food should be consistently hot. I enjoyed some of the premium food options over other buffets in Las Vegas. I would hope so as the price is in the upper range, near what some of Vegas' five star resorts charge for their dinner buffet. The best idea is to go for the wristband option from Caesar's Entertainment Corp. Thanks to Caesar's Entertainment Corp for supplying me with a buffet wristband to test a few out.\n\nI enjoyed the tempura shrimp too, quite crispy. The Spice Market Buffet is a good choice for those wanting a very large buffet and are close to Planet Hollywood."
1,What a find! My boyfriend did some research and found this place to surprise me. I am so glad he did. The burgers were delicious and the mint chocolate shake was perfection. And the service was phenomenal. Our waiter was very attentive and made sure our group had a fantastic experience.\n\nI would definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone who loves a good burger. Go and enjoy!
0,"After having an amazerball time at the Mirage but a mere 3 months ago, I decided to check out its mlife buddy MGM Grand, thinking, this is one of the more known hotels on the Strip, what the eff could go wrong...\n\nThink again sunshine.\n\nI booked a newly renovated queen smoking room at a pretty decent rate on a Thursday/Friday night.  Upon arrival at the hotel lobby at 1ish, I decided to try to early check-in since it worked out so well at the Mirage.  First of all, the lines were horrendous.  There were no counters that separated those of the mlife players and the rest of the peeps... (at least there were no indicators).  I would think you would have such a distinction as to at least put some benefit in being a mlife player.  I believe it would be good for the membership program to get some relatively distinct benefits to having it.\n\nSecond, when we finally got to the counters, we checked in with a lady named Kristine.  Now thinking I might get somewhere with a girl with the same name as me (well as same as it gets), I asked her if she had any upgrades available.  Right away, she said no.  Then she immediately, she said, \""Oh, I lied.  There's one available.\""  She quoted me $150 a night (which is what I paid to upgrade at the Mirage), and then backtracked saying it would be around that sum, but she needed to check with the manager.  She calls somebody on the phone, and all of a sudden, upon hang up, it's now $396 a night to upgrade.  What the eff.  That is nowhere near the $150 she originally quoted me.  But me not being made of money, decided that the newly renovated rooms had to do.  At this point I wasn't upset because that's how the world goes right?  Wrong.\n\nShe proceeds to check us in and first thing she starts going on was the room.  Apparently there's only one hall of renovated rooms for smokers.  And wouldn't you know it, they are out of those rooms.  I say, but I booked a smoking room. She says we have a policy that saves our *sses stating that your requested room type may not be available but we'll make a sincere effort to accommodate your request.  Now, sincere effort is pretty shady.  Because trust, even though I didn't get what I wanted, there really wasn't any effort to accommodate me.  She offered me a non-renovated queen smoking room, which I'm thinking why would I stay in a non-renovated room, when I booked MGM for the renovated ones, and everytime I would try to explain my growing upsetness, she would cut me off and throw policy at me.  There wasn't any sincere effort to be accomodating or even attempt at service recovery, which given that this is MGM is quite surprising. Oh wait, she offered me a late check out on Saturday, which wasn't that great seeing as how it's our last day in Vegas.  And she stated that the view from the room was good, \""at least.\""\n\nThen, she swiped some key cards and then tells us that there are no rooms available at the moment for us to go and vegetate after the long drive, and that  it will be somewhere around 3-4 for us to get a room number and for the room to be available.  Now on the confirmation page it says 3pm check in time.  So I'm a little bothered by this, but she says 4 for sure.  So off we go gambling.  Come 3:30  time, I give the hotline a call and they tell me, the room is still unavailable due maintenance.  A little annoyed, I decided I'll call at 4 since it would \""definitely\"" be available right?  Wrong.  Come 4, there still was no room available... this prompted a check with the floor manager and it turns out, its still being cleaned.  Finally at 4:22ish, I get a room number.  By the time I'm all settled and in the room its probably around 4:45.  I open the blinds.  Are you effing kidding me?  The view she said was good?  I can't even see any part of the Strip.  I'm literally next to ground level, and all I see are taxis and utility poles, and the bulk of the main hotel driveway.  Thinking no way am I taking this, this was the final straw.  I call hotel vip services (which is the mlife hotline) and tell a girl named Samantha all my problems.  She said that apparently my room is an accessible one, and that I requested for an accessible room.  I tell her none of my party are physically disabled, so why did we get an accessible room?  She looked into it a little more, and APPARENTLY this was the only room available.  Now I understand overbooking, as I work in the airline industry.  But when we overbook?  We comp the passengers to the point of overkill.  MGM?  Forget about it.  You can bet I'm going to march right to the check in counter tomorrow morning and getting a manager on my problems stat."
1,"What a wonderful experience.  My wife found this place on Yelp so we thought we would give it a try.  The food was excellent.  \n\nWe ordered the bruschetta to start.  The mozzarella was amazing and the bread fresh and light.  I had the flat iron steak, which was prepared medium rare, with a spicy light tomato sauce for dipping.  My mouth is watering just thinking about the taste.   \n\nMy youngest daughter had the Mac and cheese, which she proclaimed better than Morton's (which is saying something).  \n\nMy oldest daughter had the hamburger, which was freshly made and quite delicious too, although she felt is was bit overdone ( I liked it).  \n\nMy wife had the salmon, which was a little dry, but sooo good.  \n\nThe wine selection is excellent and I suggest you have the waiter make some suggestions, cause they know their stuff.\n\nBut the best part about our experience was the atmosphere.  This is a family owned place and the owners make you feel like you're at their home.  Olga, a regular, was celebrating her 50th birthday.  We were offered cake and invited into their conversation, which made the whole experience better.  The owners showed us their wine bottling area and gave us a brief history of all the vino that flowed so freely.\n\nI cannot recommend this place enough and hope they continue to thrive."
0,"Pawn Stars Rip Off artists!! My boss's niece stole some rare coins that had been graded and were sealed in plastic cases and were valued at about $40,000. She sold them at the Pawn Stars pawn shop for about $10,000. The police found this out but were told by the pawn shop that, since the law doesn't require them to hold CURRENCY for any waiting period, they had already melted the coins down. Even the police investigator knows this is bullshit as the coins by weight would only have been worth about $7,000 and no pawn shop pays out more than a fraction of the actual value of an item. A pawn shop like this would CERTAINLY have known what these coins were worth as they were graded at the very top of the scale for coins. It's good to know that, even with all their success, they are still just scummy rip-off artists at their core! I know they lost a viewer with me."
1,I take my vehicle into Wilhelm for oil changes and necessary car repairs. I have always found the front desk and mechanics to be extremely helpful and friendly. My family and I are natives and have always taken our vehicles to Wilhelm. I wouldn't think of going any other place. I would HIGHLY recommend to them to anyone!
0,"I was really looking forward to checking this place out. I noticed the last time I was in the area, that construction was going on, so I decided to stop by once I saw it was open.  \n\nIt was in the early evening, and it was fairly busy.  I sat at the bar, since I primarily wanted to see what the menu was like, and to have a drink.  My initial impression was dampened by the fact that they had no beers on tap, and the bartender was far from friendly.  He just did not have any social skills.   Looking at the menu, there was nothing that seemed to stand out. \n\nI was disappointed in the interior - but the patio was really nice.  There was nobody using it, but it was spacious and looked like it would be very nice when the weather cooled.  Plenty of TV's and the service seemed prompt.\n\nAfter having my drink, and doing some people watching, I decided to leave. I have the same feeling of some of the other reviewers. Although the crowd was somewhat mixed, it was primarily older people (and yes, I am  one of the people over 60).  But since I am not one of the old men that steals drinks, or interested in cougars, I found little to recommend here."
1,"Overdue review because finally tried this place with mom and aunts last year because we wanted to enjoy the Bellagio Fountains while dining.  Made reservations for the patio and the VIEW was spectacular! \n\nBread Basket with olives and olive tapenade was deelish especially the white chocolate bread!!!\n\nDishes ordered: Butternut Squash Pasta, Lobster Pasta, and Bass (I think)... we all shared and all of it was deelish!\n\nDesserts: Mango Brulee and Hazelnut Souffle and OMG both were too die for!!! Especially the Hazelnut Souffle!!!  Also, since my mom's birthday the server brought out 3 different kinds of truffles and they were FANTASTIC!!!"
0,"It's quiz time!\n\nQ: Let's say you were paying $170 for a massage.  Also, let's assume you've had quite a few massages in your time and are no stranger to spas.  Now, let's pretend that your massage table has a broken face cradle, forcing you to lie at an uncomfortable angle during the \""Face down\"" half of your $170 massage.  Is this:\na) Fine with me!\nb) Ok, but not great.\nc) Totally unacceptable.\n\nI vote for \""C\"" and since Qua did nothing about it when I (politely) complained to the front desk, they get two stars.  I'd make it a one star, but the spa attendants were very nice, and I fully enjoyed the steam, sauna, and arctic rooms, along with the various heated pools and warm stone chairs (sounds uncomfortable, but isn't).  Despite all that, I won't be back.\n\nFor the record, there were four of us, and only one of us was pleased with her massage.  The other two didn't have as bad an experience as I did, but they didn't love it, either."
0,"This place is a rip off. I adopted a dog last year who was 12 years old. I did not have his records nor knew of his condition. I took the dog for a check up and exam. Banfield pet Hospital staff talked me into buying their health plan for over $45 a month. Several months later my poor Felfel died due to a liver disease.I called them to cancel the plan since my dog had already died, but found out I had to continue paying into this plan for another four months.\nThis place only cares about taking your money. They are outrageously expensive for everything including shots and doctor visits. After my experience here i checked the prices at more than 22 other pet, and found 20 of them cheaper than Banfield."
1,"There really is no other good buffet place I found on the Vegas Strip before going to the Wynn. Their dinner buffet was phenomenal!!! I went with a group and it was astounding. The crab legs were already cut in half so it was easy to scoop the meat out. The Prime Rib was very juicy and very good. My friend said it was the best prime rib he's had. \n\nAnd of course the desserts ;)     They had candied apple, chocolates, cookies, cakes, you name it. \n\nDefinitely if I go back to Vegas I'm stopping here again. So worth the price per person!"
0,"This used to be my go to Chipotle, compared to the one at Alma cause their rice was always undercooked. But I might head back there now cause like stated before on other reviews, the portions SUCK! The amount of food they give: whether it's rice, meat, salsa, etc., its all VERY LITTLE. not to mention the workers there are never happy. Never. Again."
1,"I like this place...I have to say living within a 3 minute drive is prolly a key factor in us liking this place but it has good food, decent prices, and the environment is chill, modern and slightly upscale (but I still had on jean shorts and a tank top when eating dinner there with my baby and husband)\n\nWe have had the pizzas, salads (chop was good!) and their desserts were also good.  Decent food and convenient for us as a family to dine at.  \n\nTIP to restaurant: get better high chairs please!!!"
0,"The food was what you should expect when going to Denny's but the staff just wasn't that good. I've almost never had a good waitress at Denny's before. Which granted the job does suck completely, BUT, you signed up for it so don't make everyone else's experience suck because of your incompetence. If you want Denny's then you should go. But do not expect a lovely waitress to meet your needs."
1,"Chili verde birdie all the way!!! Make sure to add avocado. The bread is fresh and wonderful. Sweet potato fries are pretty good though not the best I have had. I have had the \""we must meat, I aint lion\"" and it was ok. I think I am just not a big fan of steak sammiches (unless they are like phily cheesesteaks) and gorganzola cheese. The prices are good and the service has always been decent. The biggest problem is that when you come during lunch hours, the place is packed and they don't seem to know how to estimate wait times. We were told 15 min one time and were stuck waiting for over a half hour. Overall, a very good place to eat. Guy should pay a visit here."
1,"Bless them, Lee's is now open until 8 pm!"
1,"First off, I'd like to thank you for the great reviews, Yelpers!  When choosing a vet for my puppy I read like every review.  I'm glad I did, b/c The Big Easy Animal Hospital is great.  All the staff was really nice and made me and Brock feel welcome. \nDr Ruiz is fantastic.  She really took the time to explain things to me, and gave me info on a dog trainer.  I really appreciated the time she took with me and Brock, despite it being the end of the day.  Little things like that go a long way in my book, so I will keep Brock coming to the TBEAH!"
0,"We always go to the chevo's in chandler which is delicious, the one in ahwatukee is different for some reason.  Ordered the chicken rolled tacos today there was a tiny lil piece of chicken in each one, so basically I had 3 rolled deep fried tortillas yuck! :( No flavor what so ever.  Also ordered carne asada taco the meat tasted old like it was cooked earlier and just thrown on the grill to get warm.  Very dissapointed!!"
1,"I was craving authentic Mexican food tonight and have been wanting to try out this place that I found on Yelp in Avondale, Arizona a while back. It's located in a small shopping center and looks and feels like a family owned restaurant where everyone knows everyone. The restaurant was very clean and well kept. There was not anything exciting about the decor and the lighting was very bright. This is def not a date night place but for sure where u wanna be if you want to satisfy your mexican food cravings:) The staff were all very friendly, helpful with suggestions and welcoming. We ordered all of our food at the check-out counter then sat ourselves. The girl at the register gave us some really great suggestion that were consistent with the recommendations I reviewed on Yelp. They gave us a complimentary basket of fresh tortilla chips that were drizzled with bean puree and had gorganzala cheese sprinkled over the top and four different homemade salsas to choose from.  Within 7 minutes our food was served to us. We ordered the carne asada tacos that were cooked to perfection with a lot of flavor! We also ordered the enchiladas, which came with a choice of cheese, beef, chicken or pork and rice and beans. We chose 1 cheese and 2 chicken and the both were delicious!"
1,"Need to update my review on Andre's Cigar and Cognac lounge!  \n\nI've been here numerous times now, I've been to every Whiskey Wednesday event thus far and have to say the team at Andre's ( Tanya and Patrick) always strive to give the best service!  Not only are they attentive, they know their stuff! Ask them about any cigar, cognac, whiskey, etc, they will tell you a little bit about what you are drinking and recommend others for you to try!\n\nI was thoroughly impressed with Patrick on my last visit, I was there to celebrate my birthday and we had dinner down in the restaurant before going up to the lounge for after dinner drinks.  Even though I usually come for the Whiskey events, I am a cognac drinker at heart.  He recommended a wonderful cognac to go with my cigar.  Not only did he recommend a great cognac, but also told me about a tasting flight of cognacs and armagnacs.  \n\nOH MY GOD...I would never had gotten the chance to try the bottles he pulled if he had not offered that, I highly recommend doing a tasting flight at Andre's if you get a chance!  Patrick took the time to show me each bottle and tell me a little about where it came from and the history of it.  Very impressive is all I can say!  Again, thank you SO much Team Andre's!!"
0,"The former Imperial Palace is undergoing some big renovations. So far the lobby and casino floor are looking way different. You no longer enter from the front-the lobby drop off is on the side by the outdoor Harrah's Bar. The Rock Bar that used to sit on the strip is gone, but the other restaurants inside are still there. I'm so glad nothing happened to the Hash House a Go Go! \nThe new carpet is typical gaudy Vegas carpeting, but the tile flooring is looking good. The lobby check in system needs to be faster, and maybe setup differently. It moves way too slow. \nThe gaming floor looks smaller in size, but it's not finished yet so I'm sure more is on the way. The rest of the Quad looks exactly the same. The horribly slow elevators, the buckled, dirty carpeting in the hallways, and the outdated drab hotel rooms. I met two friendly hotel staff members (the lady who checked us in at the desk who was also from Scottsdale, and our maid). Otherwise, everyone else seemed tired, unfriendly, like they hated their job and weren't afraid to let it show. Then why have I stayed here so many times? Well, it's cheap, and the location can't be beat. I'd much rather save some money staying here and spend it elsewhere in Vegas. Make sense right? I had better experiences at the old IP but maybe better times are on the horizon for The Quad."
1,"One of my favorite meals is a good steak and a potato, and I must say, I have never been disappointed coming to the Texas Roadhouse. I love the peanuts at the table. I start eating some of those right away. Iced tea is good and they keep it filled up for me. I've never had a bad waitress here. They wear really skippy short shorts here, which doesn't bother me, just an observation. I imagine that for the guys to get the good tips? The rolls are pretty good, but I wait till the end to eat one due to the honey butter that comes with it. I don't like my sweet at the beginning, only at the end. :) I order my steak medium, and it came out flavorful and juicy. I eat the whole potato, skin and all, its so good. I have met the creepy balloon guy. He's just an old man trying to make a living, cut the guy a break. I just politely said no, I would not like a balloon and he went away. Pricewise, under $20 for lunch, which for a steak restaurant, not a bad deal. If you want that nice feeling of fullness after eating a good meal, I highly recommend this restaurant."
0,"Outdoor seating location is probably the best on the strip.  However, beware of the steak sandwich.  Seems like the meat came straight out of the fridge... cold, unbooked and no taste."
0,Don't waste you money going here. You can to robertos and get the same thing. It taste way better at robertos and half the price!
0,"\""One Of My Least Favorite\""\nI generally aim for the more upscale casino's to not only gamble at but to also stay inside the hotel as well. I find these type of low budget casinos to be a bit past outdated and I guess for anybody who is on a budget that likes ancient egyptian theme's should opt for the Luxor!"
1,"Children's Safari is top notch.  Their teacher-to-child ratios are lower than the state mandates, which is the number one reason I chose them to care for my son.  Plus, Kathy (owner) and Pamela (director) really, really care about the children.  They're nice, professional, attentive to detail, and pretty much all of the things you want in a daycare provider.  The facility is new and impeccably clean.  Everything is spot on.  I just can't say enough good things about them...."
0,"I like BK, but this one was gross!!!"
1,"Go there quite often when playing poker at Venetian. The food is really good, there is a nice atmosphere, staff is nice, they have a huge selection and everyone seems to always enjoy their dishes. I wish they had more choices for vegans and one vegan dessert but there are a few menu options that can be tweaked for vegans, so it works . Bonus for late nighters... this location is open 24 hours :)"
0,"I was apprehensive about having to take two different shuttles to get to the rental agency from the airport, but I didn't have to wait for either shuttle and it was a quick ride.  However, once I got to the rental agency I waited in line for nearly 45 minutes, and when I finally did get to the agent she aggressively tried to get me to upgrade to a bigger car and it took almost 10 minutes before she finally took no for an answer.  At one point she leaned over to my husband and suggested that being pregnant, I might NOT FIT in the economy car, which I found pretty shockingly rude.  Once I finally had the car, it was fine and in good condition, and the return process was quick and painless.  However, 5 days later I'm still waiting for them to refund the $100 \""deposit\"" to my credit card."
1,"I've heard a lot of good about Nosh&Swig so I took the Mrs to see if it lived up to the hype. I have dined at this establishment 3 times now and can say that it's a solid 4 star joint. The food is good (skip the salads, not worth it) and the price OK. The pork offerings seem to be their wheelhouse (seriously great) while the chicken and beef are good options as well. \n\nThe location is the real problem for Nosh & Swig. It's in an odd location that isn't particularly convenient. It requires dining earlier to catch a show and isn't close to anything. \n\nIt's good, worth the detour, and a must try for foodies!"
1,I just moved my daughter into an apartment for college and stumbled on Farren's. We had a great burger and ice cold beer after a long drive and move in. I had the bacon feta blue cheese burger and it was terrific. Fries. onion rings and chips were all great. Service was very good. Thank you Farren's!
1,I had a situation where I needed a restoration company.  A friend suggested Polaris and I could have been happier.  Justin followed my job from beginning to end.  The end result was better than new.
1,A first class way to go to the movies. I started going to the movies here in early 2012 and have never been back to another theater since! iPic is truly the only way to watch a movie in the theater now.
1,"Fluffy sweetness in the hot Arizona weather with customized toppings?  I'm in! As a former Lollicup employee in my minimum wage days, this place is legit and even better than Lollicup.  Perfect boba texture and flavorful tea that is a relief from the powdered stuff.  Love it!"
1,Cool place. Stopped in for a quick drink with friends. I like the decor a lot - wooden log walls and high top seating as well as booths. Separate room with shuffle board and other bar games if that's your thing.\n\nDrinks are reasonably priced and there's enough parking which isn't always the case in this area. I'd go back.
0,"Small portion sizes for the price.  Inefficient, slow, especially for an airport location.  When I ordered two items, somehow the 2nd drink was never made and I'm standing there, on and on, watching other people who arrived after me receive their little lattes.  There was absolutely nothing special or deviant about my order.  After finally asking what's up, there was no acknowledgment that a mistake was made, nor an apology.  I don't care how local you are and how trendy you are, order accuracy, efficiency, and customer service still matter."
1,"The food is terrific!\n\nI was visiting Madison for a conference, and a group of us stumbled in here for dinner. The service was nice, not too slow, and the server didn't mind giving us suggestions for dinner. We did what they said and had a terrific and filling meal!\n\nThe food is something like Indian, but not quite. And it's not the same as Tibetan, but close. If you like Indian and Tibetan food, though, you'll like this.\n\nOnly 4 stars because of there atmosphere: there is none. Price is pretty good, though. We all eat very well for $25 each, including a nice tip."
1,great brunch!
0,"Food is ok, but worst customer service ever. Employees standing idle and chatting while customers wait for service. No trays to put the food on. I felt like I was an imposition on their time not a customer. I've had better customer service at Taco Bell."
1,"Sunrise Coffee is my go-to place to get my caffeine fix. I've been coming here for over three years now, and I'm happy I live just a mile from this coffee shop. I don't even know how I used to drink Starbucks before I discovered Sunrise from an old friend. Everything I have ordered here has been delicious. I love all their lattes: mint mocha, white mocha, nutella, chai tea, green tea, everything. For food, I recommend the Nomnom burrito (spinach, egg, beans, potatoes, avocado, tomato wrapped in a spinach wrap *-*) and all their pastries! Plus, the atmosphere here is amazing. They have both indoor and outdoor seating. The baristas working here are always happy. I wouldn't say this is the perfect place to study, but probably just to sit down and enjoy time & chat with friends or whatever. There's also a drive-thru which is really convenient when I'm on my way to my classes in the morning."
1,"Daniel Boulud, I am a fan so my review is just a little biased.  \n\nThe restaurant is basically an upscale, Vegas-fied Brasserie.  The usual items like steak frites, tomato tart tatin, and a few shellfish dishes are of of course staples.  Definitely try the shortribs.  If you don't like shortribs, well too bad.  These shortribs are excellent.  I'm a huge onion soup fan, and this is one of my favorites that are readily available.  You can surely tell that the broth isn't quickly assembled, and has been layered and simmering for some time.  Ahhhhh.  \n\nTruthfully, the service can be spotty and for what you're paying, you should expect just a little more attentiveness.  Is it enough to turn me away?  No, I'm going back."
0,"I think this restaurant fits american taste. Because i was the only non american to eat here just now, even though the seats are fully occupied\nIt doesnt taste like an actual japanese cuisine, it is very chinese. And i can smell chinese food right after a few second entering the restaurant. The sushi is not even firmly made\n\nI am not saying the food is bad, it is actually alright\n\n\nBut they have a great interior and place"
1,"Loved my stay at the Aria.  Stayed for just one night on a Friday.\n\nThe room is sexy as hell - when you walk in, the curtains automatically open and the television turns on, with a text on it greeting you.  \n\nBed was super comfy, the shower was great, and there was also a massive tub.  \n\nMinus one star for crappy water pressure at the sink.  This place also charges a \""resort fee\"" which has unfortunately become de rigeur in Vegas, so you will pay a little more than the advertised cost of the room.  I feel like I can't really blame the Aria for that though, since it's pretty much impossible to find a good hotel on the strip that doesn't charge that these days."
1,Been wanting to try this place for awhile. Basically it's like a subway but for pittas. The staff was very friendly and my hummus in wheat with toppings was really good. My boyfriend and daughter seemed to really like theirs as well. Only complaint is the price. I think it's a little over priced but I'd probably still come here again.
0,"The food wasn't bad (Chix fried rice & pork gyoza). They charged me for a large rice for take out  and only got a small, at least I hope it wasn't the large!  I think there might be a bit of a communication issue here. Also, Japanese or Chinese but not both please."
1,"Had the Matcha Red Bean Milk Tea was very nice, I recommend having it with 50% sugar since the red beans are quite sweet. Staff were polite and didn't have to wait too long for my drink!"
1,"this was my favorite stop in vegas.  the music was perfect even though they're a little more behind than the bay, we still enjoyed it.  it was super crowded where the main dance area was but we were still able to breathe (as if that determines what makes a good club!  haha).  the decor was awesome along with the dancers and the drinks were reasonably priced although if you asked me to name the prices i wouldnt remember.  some of the staff would be very pushy about not where to stand and to keep my shoes on (they were sore!!) but overall my experience there was top notch.  i'm sure it was more of a safety thing than them trying to be stingy about everything so 5 stars tao=)"
0,"The lines at Tacos El Gordo were too long so we decided to just eat at this Denny's. Bad choice. It was New Year's Day but the place was dead. Only one other table of customers besides us. A guy came to our table and took our drink and food order and never returned. We went 35 minutes with no drinks or acknowledgement. The manager had time to clean a window partition yet couldn't find the time to get us our drinks or even just acknowledge us. We were sat in the far corner so I couldn't see the kitchen but the manager seated us and the guy cooking took our order so they knew we were there. Finally I decided we would leave and go to a different location. I walked over to the kitchen to tell the manager we were leaving. She said \""oh wait I'll cook your food right now\"" and I told her to forget it. I mean they were only going to start cooking our food because I said we were leaving. She never once said sorry or showed any type of sympathy to the situation they put us in. She  had no issue with us leaving and could have cared less."
1,"First of all, can Yelp afford to give 1/2 stars?  The better question is, why CAN'T Yelp(!) afford 1/2 stars?  I might have given the extra 1/2 star, but for no reason at all, Yelp won't allow me that option.  I cannot believe that.  Of course Yelp must think this page is perfect and cannot be interrupted.  I disagree.\n\nI finally made it to Indulge and let me just say, I indulged.  Whoa.  The visuvio burger was great.  Moist, a damned good burger.  {Note to self: a few criticisms: \n1)wheat bun wasn't good.  It's tough and not tasty.  Ok, next time I'll try another kind of bun but the wheat bun wasn't \""my bad choice\"", it was just bad.\n2) if I order mushrooms on the burger, who said I wanted mushrooms on the side?  Mustard, ketchup, mayo...same thing.  Ordered it, wanted it, PUT IN ON THE DAMNED BURGER!!!   I want it ON THE BURGER!   But that's just me.  I could be wrong.}\n\nWhat DID impress me the most here wasn't even the burger I was eating.  It was what the guy next to me was eating.  Seriously.  Here I was, eating a really immense burger, juicy, delicious but what kept catching my eye was the Salmon Salad the guy was eating next to me.  And it didn't help that he was savoring EVERY SINGLE BITE..\n\nAnd a joint that's friendly, clean (very), can do a fabulous gigumbo burger...AND a delicious looking Salmon Salad, that's a good joint.\n\nI say thumbs up~!!!!"
1,The food here is pretty good. The mac and cheese is creamy and the chicken strips are awesome. The service is good and the price is fair. They have a bunch of sauces as well so there is probably going to be something for everybody. If you eat inside they have whatever game happens to be on which is great.
1,"Malaya Kitchen is one of those great spots that I would be missing if it weren't for Yelpers! Thanks all! \n\nMalaya Kitchen is a wonderful little gem in the Arboretum.  It's cozy and comfortable and the servers are so helpful.  You can tell they love explaining their dishes to newbies.  \n\nMy hubby and I had the Malay Roll - it's seasoned ground chicken rolled up in tofu skin and deep fried - it's served with a sweet-chili sauce and it was delicious.  It reminds me of a Chinese-Filipino dish, called Kikiam, I grew up with and it brought back some really nice memories.  We also had the Hainan Chicken  - it's poached chicken served at room temperature with the most amazing rice! And last but not least, we had the Char Kway Teow   - pan fried noodles - oh my - so good.\n\nCan't wait to go back! And their hours fit folks who tend to eat late - they close at 11:00 PM Mondays -Thursdays, at 12:00 Midnight on Fridays and 10:00 PM on Sundays."
0,"Let me start off by saying I've been to this Quiznos over 20 times, and that's a conservative estimate.  Last year they had probably a 25% failure to make the right sandwich rate.  But they have Improved this year to about 10% though.  It can be a good place to eat if you follow a couple guidelines.  First off,  never tell them what you don't want on sandwich.  Even though the ingredients are clearly listed behind them they will look at you like your speaking another language.  Tell them \"" I want an x with just the y and z\"".   Next,  don't tell them what veggies you want before theyve cooked it.  They will forget it or look at you weird.  It's kind of a hassle because you have to keep track of your sub through the cooking process but that's just the way they do it.  Follow those rules if you wanna have a good meal.\n\nAlso if the manager is reading this yelp review like any good manager should then Know this:  every single time anyone orders a sub at your quiznos they are asked if they want it for here to go twice? Is the first one just for fun?  That's a lack of communication that reflects poorly on every single customer that comes through."
1,"Came in for happy hour to unwind and visit a buddy.  \n\nOverall friendly, helpful, and knowledgeable staff.  I like that they know their menus inside and out, can ask the right questions to the guests, and make really good recommendations.  They came across as very patient and understanding.  Even the chef!\n\nI only hung out at the bar/lounge area which came across as an old school yet modern asian inspired lounge.  Of course there's bar seating but there's also a few tables in the lounge area to serve small groups.  If you wanted to, you can order from the full menu here as well....not just from the bar menu. \n\nHighly recommend the yellow tail sashimi with jalapeno.   Well balanced flavors from the ginger and jalapeno.  The texture and overall kick was tasty.\n\nBartenders were very attentive to my needs, making sure my glass was never empty.  In fact when they poured my beer from the bottle to a glass, they left the bottle with its remaining beer next to the glass.  Okay yeah not weird....but the cool part was every time they did that, the bartenders consistently made sure the bottle was turned so that the label was facing me.  Yeah at first I thought it was coincidence but then I realized each bar staff did that consistently.  Yes I drank that much to make sure it was consistent each and every time.  Ahh the simple things and details that make me happy!\n\nKevyn and Jonas:  Thanks for the recommendation on Herbs and Rye Cocktail Lounge to checkout.   That was definitely the spot I had in mind!  You were right with recommending Vieux Carre and Blood and Sand!\n\nSide Notes:\n\n-They were playing old school Jackie Chan movies on the TV screens in the lounge!  Cool.\n\n-This place can get a bit pricey, but hey it's on the Strip.....is that really a surprise?   It shouldn't be.\n\n-Its all about the quality of the food....not the quantity....there is plenty of variety on the menu!\n\n-They got Crispy Pata on the menu!  mm mmm good"
1,"I go to LGO Grocery EVERY time I go to PHX.  It has a very special place in my heart.  The breakfast food is spot-on, every time.  The French Pancakes, which I never get but always get a few bites, are quite possibly the best thing I've ever eaten for breakfast.  With the fresh cream and honey, they're near perfection.  I always get the eggs and bacon, because they prepare them so well, I'm never disappointed and I pair that with a fresh-made english muffin, that will absolutely make you question your assumptions about carbs - because you'll never be able to pass one up, once you try it.  The place isn't inexpensive, but you do get a lot of food for your $$$, so it's worth it.  I have been literally dozens of times over the last year + and it has been great every time.  I love this place.\n\nThe service is always friendly, it's a GREAT hang-out, especially after a nice quick hike up Camelback.  The bathrooms are clean, and very spacious, the parking is sometimes a pain, but it's worth paying for valet if you have to.\n\nWhatever it take, just go."
0,"I was served a cold $8.95 seafood Benedict and it was served 10 minutes after my family's meals. When I spoke to the server and then manager, they were extremely disrespectful and defensive. I've been coming here for years and have never had such a terrible experience. How sad."
1,"This place is great!  I'm not usually a cocktail guy, but this place hit a home run by way of great people making great drinks.\n\nWent here on a Friday night after having some scotch at another bar.  Waited in a short line to find a quaint bar with a couple of great bartenders.  Originally planned to just have a beer, but ended up getting a Mad Man after the recommendation of the door man.  While making the drink, I mentioned to the bartenders that I liked scotch, so my next drink was the From Smoke 'til Dawn, which was probably the best cocktail I've ever had.\n\nAwesome place to chill with a friend or two, or hell, do like me and go alone.  Great vibe.  I'll be back."
0,"The food is good but the service is terrible. We were four people and they brought our orders one by one.. We went there for the breakfast and asked them to have wheat bread, we almost finished our food and they finally served us bread at the last moment.by the way it's too expensive for this kind of food and service."
0,"I came to Sneak Peek on impulse; My husband and I just moved to the area from California and just wanted to see our little girl. We had a 3D/4D ultrasound done in CA at 17 weeks and felt we were due for another look at her. The lady was nice when we walked in and she took us in a little early. Now my baby wasn't all that cooperative, we spent quite a bit of time turning from one side to another to help her move enough to get a good face shot. That didn't happen. And I started to feel bad after the lady doing the ultrasound kept telling us how stubborn the baby was. I didn't like the quality of the pictues at all. I feel like I wasted $75 and my money would have went to better use to a crackhead. I was so dissatisfied with just the pictures that I spent some time crying about how much I hated them. I haven't even bothered looking at the DVD thing we got because I'm pretty sure its going to make me more mad. I should have just spent more money to get quality pictures at least. If I remember correctly there was only one song playing the whole time which is the song for the DVD..I'm not happy with that either. I'm just not happy with this whole thing and I haven't eaten because I'm so pissed off about it."
0,They now charge for their Wi-Fi and for some reason I didn't have a shower curtain. When I went to complain the woman at the front desk did not care. She said do you need one now? And I stated I'm checking out why would I would need one now I want to complain. She then gave me a look with attitude and I walked out. I'll never stay here again.
1,"read bad stuff about the place ( well 2 stars stuff) but this is very close to where i live so we had to try. Not that it was stelar, but the service was good and the staff eager to please. \n\nThe food itself was good i really love theirs \""porky pop\"" the pulled pork in it was perfect. The hamburger was good too. My friend loved the pasta.\n\nthe only real complain I had was and it may sound a bit conservative is that the girls where on the underdressed side, I know it's a \""bar\"" but still\n\nwe went there on the early side on a saturday."
0,"The basic service items, oil change, fluids etc seem to be fine. I had a problem with my am radio reception on channels 670 720 790 840 breaking up badly. This happens in 3/4 of the LV valley. Because it does it seems to work ok at the dealership. I was told after two visit to the shop that there is nothing they could do. Except turn it over to the corporate engineer. The would see what he says. That was approx 3 months ago. No contact since. This was the service manager that told me this. The loaner (radio)I used during the servicing did not have the breakup problem.\nI will have consider other car makes in the future. This is not good service !!!"
0,"the service here is      s    l     o    w.  Ordered the smoked salmon which was basically smoked salmon.  Friends ordered chicken fried steak which wasn't too bad.  Basically mediocre food overall.  Peach bellini was too small for the price =(.\n\nAfter awhile I felt like a prisoner.  We were in there for almost two hours because of the slow service.  I asked for the check at the same time we ordered and the waitress never brought it out, and some guy behind me was yelling that he was starving.\n\nThis place suuucks"
0,"Can't find a decent Teriyaki Bowl anywhere.  Today was my first an LAST time to eat here (take out).  I spent $8.00 each for a large Chickin Veggie Teriyaki Bowl and one with Beef.  Just a Chicken Teriyaki Bowl has rice, chicken and sauce. No Vegetables.  The chicken was old and tough, the vegetables were uncooked, and the rice was dry and sorry on both dishes.  The beef was also dry and tough.  Can you say, \""screwing Americans again\""?  Stick we Panda Express, but I do wish they something other than onions in their noodles."
0,"We waited for about an hour for brunch which is a tad too long. The server seemed very rushed and very short with us when she greeted us. When we asked for water she only brought one glass and I had to wave her down to get a second. The food was not very good. It seemed fake, like it had a bunch of fillers. I would best describe it as the IKEA of breakfast food. It was also very bland. The worst part was that both of plates consisted of about 80% hashbrowns. I'm not sure why people love this place so much. We will not be back."
0,"only came here due to starvation after being on the road for 3 hour. also needed a decently nice and quick way (we were staying in Paris) to get some food in the system before the drinking in Vegas begins.\n\nthe good:\n1. the first bite of my triple decker sandwich since i was starving. after a while it just tasted like any other club sandwich ive had. but i did think it was cool there was a sword toothpick to keep my sandwich together.\n2. the waiter was always cheerful.\n3. split checks\n\nthe average:\nthe french fries. they would have been much better if they were hot.\n\nthe bad:\n1. there was line outside even though the restaurant was half full. this is as optimistic as i will be.\n2. the service. had to flag down the waiter to order food. if you have us waiting out there im sure we'll be ready to order by the time we sit down. also took forever to get our food.\n3. must ask for bread if you are ordering sandwiches/burgers. for the record the bread is ok. would have been better if they were warm.\n4. the water tasted very \""tappy\""\n5. the waiter asked us to pay at the counter instead of him taking our checks."
0,"Fourth times a charm? -- in that THIS is the 4th time I'm posting a review of Giligin's on Yelp.\n\nThe first three were inexplicably targeted, \""flagged by the community\"", and removed by Interpol.\n\nI will attempt to stay within the boundaries of the ambiguous review rules, but not without saying that this place sucks the ass end of a donkey."
0,"This review is based on the buffet lunch on 7/1/2009 at about 12:45 PM.  The food there could have been better overall.  The sushi was barely something memorable or more likely something one would like to forget entirely because of how mushy the rice was.  The smoked salmon was ok, but tasted way better elsewhere.  The chicken tandori was a pretty bad imitation of Indian food gone bad, since the flavor of the tandori yogurt never got past the skin of the chicken at all.  The roast beef was not as good as the lunch buffet Rio at this hour since the taste was as bland as the chicken tandori.  The beef brisket sliders composed mostly of fat with a overly oily piece of onion ring that hints at the awful tasted disguised in elegant preparation.  The BBQ Roast pork bun was a sorry excuse for Chinese cuisine because of how dry the inside of the bun was.  But the buffet did have its highlights.  The Raspberry Mango pudding was good and presentation was very good,  the tapioca mango lychee pudding was also great like a 5 start taste and preparation.  The Madelines were also fluffy and perfect.  The Eggs Benedict was medium to better then average, but local dinners would have fresher tasting Eggs Benedict with the yolk more fluid instead of already solid.  Overall if you can avoid the buffet for lunch time it would be a good idea.  For the price, it is not worth you money.  Bring your business somewhere else like the Mirage.  if anybody has had a dinner experience at this buffet please post the menu items and the highlights as well as what to avoid.  Thanks."
0,"Buyer Beware!!  Be prepared to drop more $$ than you anticipate with your local dine coupon.  The coupon was $50 for the four course big night out dinner for two.  What they don't tell you is it really costs $83 for this meal.  So.....we spent $25 on the coupon for $50.  You will pay the difference on this deal, plus drinks and they add a $20 tip on top of this (for you to cook your own dinner!!).  We felt totally ripped off when we got the bill for $79.63!  This is a VERY misleading coupon.  We have not had this problem with others from local dines.  Needless to say, we will not go back to the Melting Pot again, nor recommend this place.  Local Dines needs to be more specific with the coupons and what you are really getting.  Also we had a private booth which was nice and cozy, however the music was very loud and not anything we like to listen to (old torch songs), we asked them to turn down the volume three times and it was still too loud in our booth!!"
1,"Amazing seafood! Follow the road all the way down to the glowing pink sign. It's almost as if they don't want to be noticed ... oh but they are! Just to make a reservation, you have to call their number, leave a message, and their message tells you they will call you back only if they find room for you. Don't show up unannounced or you won't get a table! I was lucky to get a call-back on a Wednesday night for a reservation at 9pm at the bar! After all that, it was a great experience. We ordered the lobster poutine, and it was really good. Some Yelpers have claimed inconsistency on this dish but luckily for us this time, it was very well made. Next we ordered a medium seafood platter which you can see in one of my pictures, it was also incredible. Unfortunately we ate too much to try the dessert but will be returning. The staff was very friendly and always attentive to our needs. The ambiance was happy and lively, and the music was not as loud as some have commented, we had no problem hearing each other. Will definitely be back, provided I get a call-back again!!"
1,"Visited here awhile back. Was a nice experience, first time to visit. Very good art museum and gardens to compliment the views."
0,"Not much to analyze....this is more Sysco slop straight off the truck.  Minimal prep required with minimal generic taste to match.  Salads drowned in dressing with the dressing full of enough MSG to swell your ankles up for a week.\n\nDazzling array of beers tempered by the knowledge that half of them aren't very good.  Must echo the review on this page noting that checking IDs of people obviously well beyond age 21 insults the intelligence of all concerned and tends to sour the relationship with the bartender from the word go.  Smug buttons with 'We ID everybody' don't compensate for legal overkill, intellectual laziness and a lack of common sense.\n\nToo many of today's parents of young children believe that any place serving food is fair game for the little darlings even if the establishment in question is primarily a bar.  One mother, who apparently was an employee but off-duty, brought the little heathen 'Crawford' (groan) over to sit him on the bartop where he grabbed straws and napkins out of the caddy and hurled them in random directions.  Of course, mom thought this was adorable - adults trying to enjoy an adult beverage somewhat less so.\n\nI don't smoke but perhaps a rethink of smoking bans is warranted if it prevents every establishment from becoming a branch of Chuck E. Cheese.\n\nit's a shame that local places have fallen prey to the same assembly line mentality as their corporate competition.  Duckworth's tastes like Chili's tastes like Applebee's tastes like Friday's.   Given that all are buying the same raw materials from the same vendor this shouldn't be a surprise but it is nevertheless discouraging trying to find a place where they actually use recipes rather than reading directions on the side of a box.  The quest continues."
0,"My wife and I went to Rio for a short vacation. This hotel is run down and not what it used to be. First Rio does not have the show above the ceiling. Which I use to enjoy watching. That is sad=T. \nCustomer service is not good either. The first room we had had a wet carpet floor, so the front desk gave us another room. Room 664 did not have soap etc. I had to call front desk to get soap. The hotel is outdated and needs new carpets. \nUpon checkout we had to pay a resort fee of 18 dollars per night plus a 12% tax rate which could not be waived. Even though the rooms for two nights is suppose to be comp. There were no signs , front desk did not even tell us there is a resort fee , etc. What is the point of a free couple of nights at Rio if you still have to pay for a resort fee. Complimentary means free not HIDDEN FEES!  \n\nTo put this in perspective .... The Gold Coast Casino which is next door DOES NOT charge you a dime when they give you complimentary nights. Gold Coast staff is friendly, have good restaurants open late at night, and provides shuttle services. And oh yeah...they have signs all over the front desk telling you there is a resort fee of 9.99 per night so you are aware of the fees. \n\nThe good:\nThey have a free shuttle that takes you to the strip every 30 minutes until 1am. Hotel is outdated but is in ok condition.\n\nThe bad:\nResort Fees are hidden.\nNot friendly front desk.\nNot not on the strip.\nHotel is out dated.\nNo good places to eat late at night in the hotel except Burger King (Yuk!).\n\nWould I stay here again? No way! I rather pay alittle more for a better hotel."
1,Everyone and their mom goes here for lunch. Why? Because they are so delicious! their sugar cookies are out of this world. The sandwiches\n are always a good choice if you don't want to go get greasy food. :) The only thing that bothers me is how pricey they can get- but if you want good food then you pay for it!
1,"This is the best bar in the area. The food on the menu is diverse, and everything is pretty much great. I believe there are 14-17 beers on tap (6 or 7 oggi's, 3 domestic garbage, 5-6 rotating guest craft beers). Happy hour goes from 3-7 and varies depending on the day, with all day happy hour friday-sunday. Steph is an awesome bartender, so stop by for lunch! Stop reading reviews and just go there"
1,"We used to go to Hooters all the time back in our home town.  It was great we met up with friends and the food was great.  We moved to Vegas and haven't really gone.  I think mostly because they aren't close to our house and we have 2 little girls.  It was a Saturday night and I asked my wife if she wanted to go?  She said sure.  This is what I have come to expect from every Hooter's I have even been too.  The service sucks!  Yes, I said it.  I lower the bar a lot when I go to a Hooters.  In fact they should just have the girls walk around and do nothing.  I will get my own refill and place my own order at a window.  Why? because I really like the wings.  I think they're great.  So when we went to this Hooter's I wasn't surprised when our waitress just disappeared for a long time.  In fact the table next to us moved and got a new waitress.  Back to the food.  the wings were great and my wife ordered a Philly Cheese steak.  The kids meals were not overpriced either.  My daughter got a grilled cheese.  We went in got our food and took off.  It was great!  So a rule of thumb.  I am pretty sure Hooter waitresses hate families,  (They like dumb guys who tip them for crappy service.) and the service sucks.  If you like wings and curly fries then go to Hooters! Cheers!"
1,"Beautiful Work, the best product, excellent price.  I wanted Huper Optik tint for my new Tesla Model S - Huper is by far the best and I have had it on previous Mercedes, Lexus, and BMW's.  Huper is what Scottsdale Porsche puts on their cars.  Danny's used to be the Arizona Huper licensee but lost it to  Supreme Mobile Window Tinting.  JR came to my home, did an absolutely beautiful job, and the price was actually less than quotes I had for 3M Crystalline, which is an inferior product.  JR did installations for Mercedes for 24 years and is a true professional."
1,"Came here after a few other pizza hotspots were totally full, but my friend and I were totally satisfied and pleased. I was craving some authentic pizza badly, and got exactly what I wanted. I ordered the Prosciutto e Cotto (prosciutto cotto, bocconcini, mozzarella, tomato sauce and portobello), and I can guarantee it is now a favourite! I've been raving about how amazing it was all night and day. They have a good wine selection too, I had a glass of their Toscana red (first on the list, can't remember it's full name), my friend had a glass of their white Chardonnay.\n\nConsidering it was a Saturday night in Old Montreal, it was definitely loud and packed, as expected. Keep in mind this is a Restaurant & BAR. With a few bachelorette parties going on, it was quite the funny sight as well. With a beautiful summer breeze, the windows were wide open and we had a lovely view of Saint-Vincent and passers-by.\n\nI'd definitely come back, the low star-rating does this restaurant no justice, I hope that changes!"
1,Looking for a dinner under $20 a person in Vegas? Try the Cheesecake Factory. If you can manage to make a decision from their huge menu (way too many options for me). I was very happy with my garlic noodles- and was really happy to save some cash on dinner after loosing some money on the tables. \nI left stuffed and happy with dinner and drinks- and our bill under $75!
0,Too expensive for what it is....but then it's on the mt so they bump prices up for the tourists. The fries are incredibly salty almost inedible.  Good for tourists not locals
0,"Update 10-07-14\n\nA lady called to \""set things right\"" a few minutes ago.  She was very argumentative in an effort to explain why I was wrong.  She explained that the \""2-hour\"" ATV ride Groupon is from door to door.  She stated that the clock starts when they pick you up from your hotel and ends when they drop you off.  This includes traffic. This means that you only get 45 minutes of actual riding time.  I'm not easily provoked, but this lady managed to push all the right buttons.  I'll see if my party of eight will post on yelp to confirm our experience with this company."
1,"I love BBQ and Waldo's Pig-n-Out satisfied that crave. I see the reviews regarding the small portions, but apparently they now have a large sandwich which has double the meat. The pork sandwich was $6 and the brisket was $7. I got the large and it was plenty for me. That is still very reasonable for BBQ. I would say it is more of a take out place. The sauce is really good, the kind I like.I would recommend this place to everyone and I hope everyone goes so it will stay in business. I see the are open for breakfast, too."
0,"I am sorry but I can't pay $25 for a drop in yoga class. I can go to 2 yoga classes at most places in the valley for this price. I did loved going here when it was less pricey, the classes are really fun, most of the teachers play upbeat music to keep the class motivated.  The classes are more fun than a spiritual practice, but if you are looking for a good time after work that doesn't involve booze and you have money coming out of your ears...check this place out!  Please At One Yoga, have a heart for us students!!  Lower your prices!!"
1,Exit 41B on the highway. Typical outlet location. Nothing special beside the problems of finding parking. Must get there early to be the crowd.
1,I was turned on to the roasting company by a colleague and now I'm addicted.  It's truly as good as it gets.  I always get the quarter chicken and it's better than you'll find almost anywhere.  Apples are wonderful too. Everything is served hot the fresh.\n\nThere's a reason there's always a line and parking can be hard to find...this place has chicken covered!
1,Go here practically everyday! The food is always fresh (I can taste it practically off the stove) very friendly staff! Awesome environment for anyone to go to to relax or catch up on a good book.
0,"Umm like Yelp says up there ^ methinks not! Came down for the Downtown Wednesday Block Happy Hour. They were busy, about 2-3 people deep. We were the 2nd so we got a seat at the bar pretty much as soon as we walked in and conveniently  near the Happy Hour specials sign. However, he failed to serve us in an appropriate time frame. Since he was busy ignoring us we figured we'd ask about the specials and decide what we wanted while we waited for him. We asked the bartender what beers were on special he said they all were. We asked twice, even. They, as well as some of the other bars had a special that included a beer and a shot for $6.00(I believe it was $6.00) Well neither of us are shot people so we just ordered the beer, he said $18.00. I said oh we only get the special if we order a shot? He took a beer away and gave us a bottle of beer and said $20! WTF!! Umm that still doesn't solve the problem. I spoke up and said you said all the beers were on special. He mumbled something but basically used the excuse that they were busy as to why he screwed up our service. I should have told him to shove it and go somewhere else but I didn't, I took the beer and the crappy shot and went on our way. Doubtful that I'll be returning. Poor service, as a bartender you have the power!! Give me the beers you screwed up at the special price listed, you get a bigger tip. You screwed it up after all. The worst part is that he could have cared two craps less that he didn't pay attention, didn't listen and that he screwed it up. Blah!"
0,"Went to grab a late night cup of coffee at this 24-7 spot.  The coffee is great but the service was bitchy. She really thought her coffee grounds didn't stink and seemed annoyed at our arrival. The place was thrown together in a quant old bungalow style home which has character,  but ultimately lacked class in the staff,  which is what would make a difference.  Next time I'll go somewhere else because service is half of it!"
1,"This is a really good Thai restaurant. The food was excellent. We ordered clear noodles, awesome. Pad Thai with shrimp was perfect. My kids had the chicken skewers with peanut dip and loved it. There were no left overs because we ate everything up. MMMMMM. I highly recommend. We will be back."
1,Really don't care for burgers!!!!  Went to Bachi Burger with friends and found out what a great burger is.  Now every time we have friends in town or even family we all head to Bachi Burger for a great Burger experience.\n\nIf you want a great experience you need to check this place out!!!!
1,This was the right decision when it comes to brick oven pizza in Arizona. The wait was only 30 minutes and the pizza was so much better than the well known and televised local competition (let's just call them pizza B). The ambiance was fantastic and it was the perfect date spot for the wife and I to sit back and relax. They even had a local musician playing live music to even better the mood for dinner. Service was fantastic and every part of our dinner made the wife and I happy about our dinner choice.\n\nLet me start by saying everything I ordered was perfect.\n\nThe ostra salad was plenty as a starter for the wife and I and it was fresh with fantastic tasting ingredients.\nThe diavola spicy pizza with ricotta added was the best pizza I have ever had.\nMy wife's white pizza was fantastic as well it had mushrooms greens and pork I believe on it\nThe banana creepes with Nutella and ice cream was oh so yummy.\nThe fresh made iced tea was also unique and fantastic.\n\nWe left with a 3 course meal for around $60 which is not bad at all for the experience and food we received\n\nI would most defiantly recommend this restaurant to anyone.
0,"TOTAL liars.  They act like they have this huge inventory of cars, however they just search the internet and get the car from another dealership.  They pay dealership profit and charge you a fee which allows them to take advantage of customers both ways.  In this internet world, we should just find the cars we want on our own.  They lied to us and will never ever use thier serivce.  I have asked to speak with the owner but he is never in the office."
1,Awesome looking shop. Employees are super helpful and friendly. Very informated and answered all my questions. Most definitely coming back!
1,"We stayed here just one night and had a great experience from the moment we arrived. The valet is very helpful and the service is fast. We got to our room and found a great layout and beautiful view. There were flip flops and two robes awaiting our arrival in the room, and the mini bar was well stocked. We had dinner in the restaurant and it was one of the best meals we've had on our trio so far. Definitely recommend the restaurant for dinner and breakfast!\n\nThe one gripe is the service in the restaurant - it was a little slow and we had a number of different people waiting on us and bringing food. We sat on the terrace in the morning and there must have been a good party at the pool the night before, but it hadn't been cleaned up. That was a little odd given that it was 9:00 am and there were still bottles, twels and even boxer shorts lying around. \n\nOverall, the sanctuary was a great stay and one that I'd recommend to anyone looking for relaxation and good service."
0,"I'm soooooo done with Hooters.  I use to be able to defend them by standing by their food.  But not lately.  The wait staff is always nice, but ordering food seems to be a laborious process and then the quality of the food just outright sucks.\n\nThere is one redeeming point about this particular Hooters location.  It is right on Mill Avenue and the outdoor seating is a great place.  Good fresh air and excellent vantage point to see the party below as well as the Tempe Skyline.  It reminds me of a western version of Bourbon Street.  Any restaurant on Mill Avenue with a 2nd floor balcony will have this perk - and hopefully better food."
0,"Yesterday we wait over 25 min for the food. When we ask the manager she say: I'm taking care of it right away. 10 min later we decided to leave and the manager say: \""I don't want to serve you....\""  \n\nWe visit this restaurant many times but they will NOT see us again for long time\n\nPS: the restaurant was almost empty"
0,"Horrible.  So disappointed.  The food was old and tasted like cafeteria food.  Even the crab legs tasted off.  I am one to always try something once always give it a second chance, but I'm breaking my own rule and saying STAY AWAY!!!!"
1,"Caleb is the best!  I work at the salon up the street, and this place is always nice to walk into.  My boyfriend has been coming here, and the customer service is top notch.  He was a hardcore tobacco chewer for 15 years and hasn't bought ANY since he started vaping.  The knowledge here is top notch.  Very welcoming to beginners.  I recommend everybody here for starter sets or flavors."
0,"I was hungry for dishes remind me of my childhood. So when I discovered HTK I wanted to try it the first chance I got. My hubby and I went about 6 weeks ago. We were fine with the restaurant's modest decor and so-so service. I ordered fermented fried stinky tofu, oyster omelet, preserved white radish omelet, rice and tea.\nThe stinky tofu had ok flavor, but they cut it too small, so there was not enough tender tofu in the center. The surface was crunchy which was good, but with so little soft tofu in the middle, it tasted too chewy. The radish omelet was pretty good, like how I remembered it. But the oyster omelet was not so great. It had too much starch and was not hot. Having oyster in the dish, this needs to be eaten hot. Luke warm or cold makes it not enjoyable."
0,"Worst service I can recall having at a local Las Vegas bar!  Indeed \""Hendertucky\"", and they show it. Rude bartenders, awful cocktails that were watered down and just made poorly. Each time myself or one of my friends wanted a drink, we had to wave down for service (and we were sitting right AT THE BAR), then often got the eye roll thing as if we were a bother. If not for the fact that a friends band was playing there the night we went, I would NEVER go to this place. Hey bartenders, try and take some lessons in kindness and good CUSTOMER SERVICE, and perhaps a class in how to make a cocktail,\n will ya'!!!!!  Good grief!"
0,I called to get a bridal dress hemmed - no other alterations - she said the turn around time was about 2 months.   That's completely contrary to every other review on here.   Fail. Next.
1,"Absolutely one of my favorite restaurants in Phoenix! Always have gracious servers and an amazing crowd. The best is the food, always consistent and always great tasting!!!"
0,"The last few times we went in there were MANY dirty tables.  We walked in the other night and almost every table was uncleaned, the kid who worked there was just standing there; he made no attempt to say hello or make a move to bus the tables.  We loudly stated that if they couldn't even clean the tables, they probably wouldn't be able to serve us either, turned around, and walked out (we went to Euro Pizza instead).  Although I liked the food on past visits I am definitely turned off to Streets at this point, not sure if we will ever go back again.  \n\nI hope management reads this and does a reassessment of their business practices.  We need good places to eat in Fountain Hills.  Tell me you made changes and we will be back."
0,"I ate here once for a retirement dinner for a friend, and once was enough.\n\nThe place was nasty dirty, the tables (that you eat on....) were the worst.\n\nThe pizza was pretty bad ( Eatza Pizza, Ci Cis, etc level) and to be honest I have had frozen pizzas that were better.\n\nI find it disheartening that so many people rate this place based completely on the novelty, as I would rather have great food in a bland place then horrible food in a dirty place with a gimmick. \n\nWith all the diverse places and interesting food choices we have in this city, paying for really bad overpriced pizza in a place that they don't even bother to clean is silly - even if they do have a Organ.\n\nAnd they only take cash? Seriously? My landscape guy even has a credit card machine in his truck, so why can't this place accept debit/credit?\n\nBottom line, ignore the novelty - if you want pizza go to Spinatos or Mellow Mushroom."
1,Best nail salon ever!! They always do a great job and the prices are very affordable. Everyone is always very nice and want to make sure that you are satisfed. I wouldn't go anywhere else.
0,"By far the worst service ever, besides the manager being incompetent and not knowing how to asses the situation and know how to manager the room he rather have a bunch of upset customers who are they to watch their team play, he has the sound and tv on games that no fans are their. Then the waitress brought the wrong order. Over all they all looked like chickens with their heads cut off. I've never ever not left a tip but this is one time I will not."
1,The best burritos ever.\n\nI get the shredded beef and bean and add extra cheese. These suckers are juicy so make sure you have plenty of napkins. Add red sauce with each bite and you'll be absolutely in burrito heaven!\n\nMy babes gets the steak and egg and I hardly ever actually see the thing he mows through it so quick.
1,"Excellent buffet. My family and I went for the lobster/wine buffet on Sunday night. Got in with minimal waiting. I'm a red wine snob, so tried both red and white and opted for the Chardonnay, as the Malbec served was weaker in flavor. The lobster came quickly was served hot, tender and moist. The salads were fantastic... watermelon with jicama, tomatoes with figs, marinated mushrooms with garlic & peppers, and a medley of olives, cornichons, garlic & rosemary. Nice sushi selection for apps, but basic rolls, nothing unusual. Massive amts of crab legs with fresh lemon and drawn butter. The Asian green bean and beef entree was seasoned well and veggies crisp and flavorful. The lobster ravioli was delicious and very  gourmet. The tandoori chicken, naan and curry were great! The roasted veggies had pitty-pans (baby squash) which are pretty pricey at the market.The lamb was overcooked for my taste and difficult to get a rare slice. All in all very well done with minimal disappointments. Not  a huge selection for dessert, but all we tried was light and tasty. Service was ok... seemed understaffed for as pricey as it is! Nice fresh and light decor and very clean. Not your standard buffet fare, so important to go with an open mind willingness to try! I would definitely go again!"
0,a few sundays ago we always go to pink doughnuts because they are phenomenal and smashburger just happens to be in the area. Ive had it before and on a food only review this gets a 2.5 stars even though we walked out. So there is a soccer park next to this location and it was busy. The hostess/cashier at the front took our order didnt really say a word about the wait. 30 mins later as i see togo customers packing their own orders in the bags I knew it was busy. Meanwhile my wife is getting stressed because we have somewhere to be. there were about 6 parties that sat down after us and all of the orders came up. 38 minutes in; the food finally pops up. I can read the order window and all the togo food is done after priority of the people sitting in. Not a problem if i was told it would be 45 mins. Meanwhile i confront the hostess if i can get my food because she is knee deep in the weeds. she says no ill do it when im ready. i reply its been 40 mins. she says well im not working in the back its not my fault. being a business owner i understand customer service and i know for a fact the customer is always right even if i tell you its blue and the damn color is red. So i reply are you arguing with me. Which she then says no im just saying its not my fault.  So needless to say we walked out and said we wont be back.
1,"Went on a Saturday morning, and it was packed...that was a good sign!  Although it was packed, we only had to wait 10 mins for the 3 of us.  I had the Eggs Maximilian with chorizo...wow...what a huge meal for $10.  I was pretty well nourished for the remainder of the day.  Full of flavor since it had everything but the kitchen sink in it.\n\nService was fast and friendly...drinks never got below 1/2.\n\nWill definitely be back!!!"
0,"Wow, I can not believe I walked out of here paying $500 for my cat to feel better.  I know I could have spent less, but we had just moved to the area and I didn't know where I could get a vet quickly.  So I went.  They were slow and slow to examine.  I knew the only thing wrong with him was a UTI, but they wanted to sell me on everything in the book.  Finally, they tested him and kept him for the rest of the day for monitoring.  Give me a break.  I only spent this much and put up with all of it because they were guilt tripping me into it.  \n\nThen, for an entire year, I get numerous phone calls from them asking me to make a follow up appointment.  I had even asked them to stop calling.  Ugh.\n\nI will never let another vet guilt trip me like that again.  I can't afford $500 and had to put it on credit.  I never do that.\n\nYes, the cat got better, but I wish they had listened to me and just tested really quick and given me the meds for him."
0,"Avoid Marcel Painting at all costs. We hired them to paint the interior of our house and kitchen cabinets. They failed to tape off the windows, fixtures and parts of the carpet. We now have over-spray everywhere that we have to clean up. The fixtures were ruined and had to be replaced. The kitchen cabinets were not properly cleaned and sanded. They are full of bumps and runs. I would not hire them to paint a dog house."
0,"I'm really sorry to do this to all the peeps from hawaii that love downtown hotels but I have to write about the buffet at Fremont.\nJust got back from Vegas and my wife and her cousin had a really bad experience.\nThe whole trip they were excited to get crab legs at Fremont on friday night. They couldn't wait so when friday came, you could see the excitement on their faces.\nMy wife used my coupon from vacations hawaii and her cousin just paid full price. $15.99. Super cheap..\nThey started to get down to business and piling on the crab legs and clams. Well half way through the dinner, the cousin bites into a clam and finds a STAPLE in the clam. Yes, a staple. They both were like \""What the hell is this?'.\nThey call over to the manager that was standing there and told her about the situation. The manager had the nerve to ask the cousin if she put it there. They both were shocked at what she had said. They said 'no' but the manager didn't believe them. Come on lady, are you mental?\nMy wife and her cousin wanted just an apology and everything would of been okay but manager wench wasn't giving in. Okay, talk to the chef.\nThe chef comes out and was really sorry and kept on apologizing but I'm don't think he was using his noodle when he said\"" Oh yeah, this kind of thing happens all the time. At least once every other month\"" STUPID, you just admitted to having this problem and you're not trying to fix it. My wife and her cousin was laughing because they couldn't believe what these peolple were saying and doing. Nutcase manager and Stupid chef.\nThe manager is so pissed at my wife that she finally gives them a refund but not the $15.99 but the coupon. THANKS!!!!!!!!!! I guess she wants us to come back the next night. \nMy wife left the place in shock and left a nice tip for the Fremont Buffet.\nTHE COUPON...."
0,"Terrible hostess, doesn't have communication with guests, isn't respectful or friendly and ignore customers"
0,"Fresh Cleaners was OK, but the customer service was really lacking. \n\nThe young woman at the desk seemed a little unsure and didn't really seem to understand (or maybe didn't know how to explain) their cleaning process when it comes to delicate items. \n\nI felt good about going here because of the \""green\"" cleaning method, but the customer service was a let down. Plus, when I got one of my tops home, a thread had come loose on the cuff. And the fibers seemed very worn, like it had been brushed."
1,"I never enjoyed working out until I came to Amenzone Fitness DC Ranch!! Not only do I get intense, total body conditioning workouts, but I have fun while doing it. The owners and other instructors are some of the nicest people you will ever meet. I walk out of this gym feeling confident and strong. Nobody should be intimidated by the workouts..... they are incredible!\n\nOne of my favorite parts of this gym is that after every class, the instructor gives a message pertaining to the other aspects of living a healthy lifestyle: happiness, facing your fears, resiliency, etc. They all inspire me to become a better person. I feel like the gym is a family, and I became part of it right when I walked through the door on my first day."
0,"First of all this is a rip off for $12, not including the drink. The place is filthy, there's food all over the floor under the tables, they are understaffed, and the food is not all that great to begin with.\n\nIt takes forever to get a drink or to get your table cleared of food. This is pissing me off because you go to the casino and get world class service, all the food you can eat, including the drink for 8 bucks!\n\nIf you like to get pissed off and frustrated, then eat here but if not, go somewhere else where they  have better service and better food. $12 my ass!\n\nDam!"
1,"I came to Siena for something other than your typical Lasagna ... I wanted something different.  I took a look at their chef's specials and found something I think I could love! It was risotto with chunks of calamari in a cream sauce. How could I go wrong! While I was waiting in anticipation I sampled some bread and crackers the waiter brought out. It's always a plus when a restaurant brings out something to munch on before the meal whether it's a sample of their offerings, chips, bread. I love it all! \nWhen the Calamari Risotto came out I gave it a nice squeeze of lemon all over. I think lemon juice makes seafood dishes pop with flavor. It was already flavorful but I love dishes with some zing! It was a nice healthy serving so I brought some of it home. I had to reserve room for some dessert. I didn't know what to order so I had the sampler that had 4 slices of cake on it. I knew one was Tiramisu but the rest I wasn't familiar with but they were still delicious! The slices were pretty big for a sampler so it was cool I had someone to share this delectable dessert with. \nThe service was great we were always asked if everything was okay and our glasses were never empty. The atmosphere in Siena is very relaxing with dark wood and candlelight. They also have a deli attached to the restaurant if you don't have time for a sit down meal. I wouldn't mind trying that next!"
0,"Read carefully!! The food was great!! My food was awesome!! Again, Food gets 5 stars!!!! However, the service SUCKED!!\nOur waitress was just not good. She tried to do nothing but upgrade us. No drink refills. After we got our food she was gone!!"
1,"Swung in here for the happy hour special (noon to 8 or something) and loved it!  Stayed out a little later than normal on Fremont St the night before, so needed something to take the edge off quickly the next am.  I am a dive bar fan having vising a crap load of em whilst growing up on the southside of chicago.   And a dive bar indeed.  Be sure to set expectations appropriately. \n\nAnyway, $2 specials. Beer, shot of beam, or mix drink.  Ass juice was a tad sweet for me, but my date, she loved it. Great service and had a good local crew (\""this fool was arrested for not having brakes on his bike\""...bahahaha).  Solid juke box.  Food available and delivered near by. \n\nFunky washrooms (love the toilet paper rolls on the chain link), painted walls and all. Stickers abound with some type of drunk, crazy spray painting...sorta like a tagger went insane or something.  Pretty cool. No funny smells or bar flies.  Brand spanking new, shiny, white, Kohler top of the line, urinal in the mens room.  Nice touch. \n\nNice place for a quick stop on the way to the airport (after some quick gaming at terribles-ie silver sevens...ha).\n\nGood afternoon buzz!"
0,"Ate at the Coronado location today.  Had the Vampiro Pastor. The marinated pork was moist and tasty, reminiscent of Chinese roast pork (char siu), it was piled high with all the typical fixins, but the grilled pineapple was what put it over the top. So yummy, there's no need to put salsa on it.  \n\nThe special cerviche that's only available Fri & Sat, was awful. Tasted more like they served it the week before. Decor could use some sprucing up and beware of the bees if you plan on dining outside. Even though the ambiance and cerviche were below average, I'd take a drive to get more Vampiro Pastor."
1,"Mediocre dry cleaning. I want to like this business..why? 1. I like to support Yelp advertisers 2.prime location!!! It is literally around the corner from me and I will probably still go there once in awhile out of convenience.  Once or twice I called rushing to get there before they closed and they waited a minute over closing time which was very nice of them. However, this review is simply based off of satisfaction with my clothing.  Almost every time I have come there I have to ask to redo my shirts.  It drive me nuts because the employees are nice about it.  When I woke up today and had 50 dollars worth of clothing needed to be dry cleaned I drove 20 minutes to my old favorite cleaners in Arcadia.  I knew that I trust them with my clothes and after years, never had to deal with such an inconvenience.  I'm sorry but had to only give 3 stars. I might be back one more time.. only when I have to.\n\nJohn I read your message and appreciate that so I updated my review out of appreciation towards your response. I want to come back because it is convenient. Thanks for caring"
1,"Cheapest AYCE sushi price 16.99$ for the whole day. The whole menu is include in AYCE. This place is really hidden by Sonic so me and my husband are usually the only ones there. The restaurant itself isnt anything fancy. The owner is really nice and didn't charge for my couple of unbeaten rolls. It's not the best sushi but for the price and the decency of it, I will keep coming back :)"
1,"The only reason they didn't get a 5 star rating is my extremely high standards for a good hoagie. Good prices, great ingredients (would be better with cherry peppers) and the service was very friendly. I will go back for sure. The sandwich fulled me up and I liked the selection as well. I will go back for sure."
0,"poor service, took 10 minutes to get water. Never got refilled. Food was slightly more interesting than IHOP or Denny's but about the same quality. Great place to go after a night of drinking I suppose. We won't be back, just wasn't impressed."
0,"Ate here late Saturday night as this is the only place open. Long line as expected. Cooks seem to be busting their butts making orders but not \""in order\"" if that makes sense. \n\nWe ordered a Reuben with waffle fries and were given #4, they were still calling #'s in the 90's. They got to #99 then #'s 1, 2 and 3. Then #15, 13, 9, 7. I can see if they had like hotdogs, pastries or something easy to make but they were getting triple decker pastrami's and sh*t. WTF!! Our order should've come first!\n\nWe waited like 15-20 minutes after they called #3 before they finally called our #4. Bullsh*t! As for the food it was just alright."
1,I have been coming to this place for as long as I can remember. I like having the torta cubana here. I wish they still had the ice cream tho...
0,"Well, this place has had plenty of time to get they're act together.  The service is horrible!  Food is just ok, which is sad because when they opened they got 4 stars from me.  I'm surprised that they're still in business but there isn't a whole lot of options here. The chips n Salsa/Bean Dip is yummy but that's it. Keep searching!"
1,"I cannot handle how great this place is. Sure, the wait is about an half hour long even when you have a reservation and the entire menu of what looks like 50+ different options is only written on one single chalkboard that sprawls across one wall of the restaurant, the place is still so fantastic. \n\nSERVICE\n+ Our server was the most darling and helpful waitress I have ever encountered. She started us off by spending literally 20 minutes translating and describing every single item on the menu for us in such a passionate and compelling way that we needed another 20 minutes to decide what the hell we should order from all the mouth-watering options. Throughout the night, she wasn't hyper attentive to our table, but she made it up by being so sweet and friendly. Oh, and she also came out with two desserts even though we only ordered one, because she knew we had made a conflicted choice and really wanted us to try both. Oh, and since we were the last ones in the restaurants on a Friday night, she poured us some shots before we left. BEST SERVER EVER. \n\nFOOD\n+ Overwhelming\n+ Incredibly delicious\n+ Everything we ate was delicious and somewhat heftily portioned, so my advice to you is this: Go with your gut. You won't go wrong. \n+ If you'd like a more specific recommendation: get the duck. So so so good. \n\nAMBIENCE\n+ Love the soft lighting and the romantic feel of the strung christmas lights\n+ Filled with young, hip montrealers, out-of-towners, and any people who like to eat good grub\n+ The kind of place I would love to eat at every night of the week in New York. It has just the right feel of fun, casual, and hip without any of the pretension and wear-and-tear of overhyping. Absolutely love it!"
1,"What a great off the strip Italian restaurant!!! Such a refresher from all the cookie cutter really over priced restaurants located inside the hotels!\nThe service was impeccable from the minute you walk in. The staff look like they stepped out of a Al Pacino move.. I mean that in a good way by the way...\n\nThe ambiance and the vibe were so up beat that just looking at their menu mad my mouth water. They make all their own pasta fresh, wow no Chef Ragu/Prego working there..\n\nWe ordered the antipasti appetizer. It was filled with different kinds of cheese, olives, pickled artichokes, prosciutto, spicy ham. I'm not a fan of olives but the red ones weren't all that bad. It was really good and pair that up with the bread they bring you at the table and you practically have your meal right there. But better save some room for your dinner because you have to try their pasta dishes. I ended up ordering the seafood spaghetti meal that had scallops, huge pieces of shrimp and calamari. I admit it was good but a little too much on the seafood. My BF had the Sea Bass and it was really melt in your mouth type of meal. The fish was cooked to perfection! \n\nI would have given them five stars but I wasn't that crazy about my meal but I am more than willing to go back for more and possibly change it.\n\nHighly suggest this restaurant when in Vegas. It's located behind the Hard Rock Hotel off of Paradise in shopping center that has CVS in it. \n\nOh and for the ladies.. in that shopping center is a nail salon that is open 24/7.. oh yeah.. I can see it now drunk mani/pedi's...good stuff.. Have to try that one when I go back to Vegas..."
0,Pros and Cons of D hotel -  I give it .....a D. \n\nPros\n\nCheap\nGood central location for downtown\nsemi modernized compared to other Fremont hotels\n\nCons:\nbathroom has no vent - poopoo smell stays forever\nno coffee or coffee maker\nancient parking very narrow - hard to park for larger cars\nWindows facing Fremont street are super loud with noise until early morning\nEven elevated views from windows are semi blocked by terrible net-like cover -either for sun blocking crude way or for some advertising\nsmall elevators are almost always full and make scary noises
1,"If places got stars for winning my business, this place would have tons! Truth is, the burgers are solid, the cheese fries and fried pickles are good (any place that even HAS cheese fries and fried pickles is probably going to be a fave of mine), the beers are big, but nothing is the absolute best I've ever had. However, I love sitting outside RIGHT on the strip on a beautiful day, and getting in and out for parking/driving is a breeze... so, yeah... solid 4 stars!\n\nThey've started giving you the big beers in glass cups which I'm not a huge fan of, but I find if you ask, they'll give you a branded plastic one to pour into, and then keep (and if you're like me, you'll get 'service for 12' in no time :-) ) --- bonus is they are also dishwasher safe so far!\n\nSo go.... Go for the sunshine and beautiful outdoor seating in a primo location on the strip (anywhere else will cost you far more in food/drinks for such a spot)... Go for a burger, a big beer, some cheese fries, and some fried pickles.... I'll be sad when this place inevitably gets changed into something that charges more."
0,I'm only giving them 2 stars because from the outside the shop looks nice. \n\nBut what I don't like about this place is their false advertising. On their door and on their voicemail they said they'd be open on NYE until 1pm. I am here 25 minutes before then and they aren't. \n\nI drove out of my way specifically to come here and they aren't there. These types of careless mistakes can cost you customers and better yet negative review reporting.\n\nThis type of thing shouldn't happen. Although it might be a little mistake it was careless and it just costed them an angry customer.
0,Thank god that I had a groupon for here because I would not be to trilled if I had to pay the full price. The food was ok but I server was just not on top of things. I think that's what made me not want to return here.
1,"I really like this place for its simple dishes yet fresh, flavorful ingredients.  \n\nWe ordered a variety of things, including their cheese platter (served with truffle honey, cherries and fresh orange marmalade- the best condiments a cheese could ever have), a sampler of various cold tapas (7 small dishes in all which were all pretty good), a margherita pizza, a few pasta dishes, and their osso bucco which was flavorful but not as tender as I would have liked it (it also didn't have the bone marrow which I normally love in osso bucco)."
0,"I absolutely hate this hotel.  It has become so old and dingy and the quality of service has gone downhill in the last couple of years.  They really need to renovate this hotel.  \n\nHotel rooms are the same as they were 5 years ago.  Their furniture is scratched and worn.  Their TVS are complete dinosaurs.  Very old and hardly work half the time.  Their movies for purchase don't even work!  They have on demand but it's fuzzy and static-ey ALL the time.  I am constantly having to get a refund because their movies are terrible quality.  $15.99 for a blurry movie?  I don't THINK so!  You are telling me that after so many complaints you can't at least fix that ONE issue?  Is this hotel really that hard up?\n\nTheir room service is even worse.  They take about an hour and 15 minutes to get to the room and then the food arrives cold and tasteless, yet they charge an enormous amount.\n\nTheir beach area is the nicest thing about Mandalay.  It's fun, hip and the concerts are great.\n\nI just really don't like staying in their rooms but we stay here because we are noir members and get free accommodations.  Since MGM falls under the same company we should try that hotel next time.\n\nThe worst part of this hotel is the gaming!  Terrible slots that I never win on.  I have to go to other hotels to win.  Why do I even bother with this hotel?!?\n\nMandalay Bay really needs to get it together and make some changes.  They don't come close to the newer and better hotels.  This place is a disappointment every time I stay here."
1,"I have a story about this particular florists...\n\nAbout 3 years ago, my ex boyfriend was desperately trying to get back together with me - I'm quite a catch, y'know. We had broken up before I moved to Edinburgh but he didn't take it too well. Anyway, I hadn't heard from him in a few weeks so I thought he had moved on...until I got a phonecall telling me I had a package at reception. It was an empty vase and a single red rose. The card just said 'it's a' . I was totally confused...but low and behold the next day I got another phonecall, another package. Another rose...this time the card said 'new year' . Ok, so I was beginning to get it. Every day for a fortnight I got a rose with more words on it, concluding to 'it's a new year, so let's try a new start? meet me at the witchery, sunday 9pm' . Cute , huh!! \n\nI was totally impressed with Interflora though, they were extremely professional and their customer service was brilliant. They knew that the overall message was - since they were sending it every day, but still enjoyed it alongside me.  They were absolutely brilliant.\n\nYou'll be glad to know I did go and meet my ex at the witchery and we did have a lovely meal. However, I told him we were never going to be together since he had slept with a married woman while we were together. \n\nAll's fair in love and war."
1,"Love this place! The food is great and the drinks are fun. I am a Vegas local and my gf and I like to frequent this place when were in the mood for a date night.\n\nI have tried multiple things on the menu but the French onion soup and New York strip are fantastic! I also get a side of grilled asparagus and it is sooo good! Not only is the food good, but it is just an overall fun atmosphere and I think that's why we end up there a lot of times. The Passion Punch goblet is my favorite, not too sweet, more citrusy. But if you are looking to get a buzz I would recommend getting you're own. When we split one neither one of us feels buzzed at all by the end of it. \n\nFor the most part we have had great service at the bar or a table. However, we did come across one bartender recently that was rather rude. I won't hold it against him though, we both work in the industry as well and know how tough it can be to put a smile on you're face when you're really just not feeling it that day. Def recommend!"
1,"My new favorite take out place.  Friendly staff, good, fresh and delicious food"
1,I love this place. So suprised that there are any negative reviews. Weather is cold now and this place has great comfort food. Friendly staff and a nice atmosphere. My family and I eat here at least once a week.
0,"We decided to try this place since its close by. I categorized this place as my 'will try once\"" food place. I really want to like it because of their selection. Sadly i am not returning as a customer. \n\n- long wait, disorganized\n- food was blah, only good food was texas toast! \n- not a lot of seafood selection"
0,"Came here for lunch, portions were small.  Took 20 mins to check out after eating because they were understaffed."
0,"Not impressed at all. Took 1 hr and 45 minutes for 4 of us. That's extremely slow for even the best steakhouses in town let alone an Asian place. We ordered around 6 items, I ate only one bite from 4 of the dishes. The fried dumplings and pork buns were the best items we had. The sauce that came with the calamari was absolutely horrid. Food was just not good enough for the wait - won't ever be back."
1,"We had an awesome pool man that we really enjoyed, but he passed away out of the blue and I didn't think we were ever going to find anyone as good as he was.  I let the pool go for months without being cleaned.  It was DARK green and getting worse.  \n\n I called up Mr. De La Rosa and he was able to come out and do a consultation that day!  In two days our pool was back to crystal blue. I also hired him for a weekly pool cleaning service.  I don't even need to worry about our pool any more because it has been perfect ever since. \n\nMr. De La Rosa is professional, knowledgeable, and his prices are competitive.   I would definitely recommend him to anyone."
1,"Quite a few Chinese places have sprung up around Ayrsley recently, but Royal Panda has been there longer than any of them.  The decor is dated, but they have a great lunch buffet (as long as you like chicken!).  The buffet selection may not be as vast as other places, and the dishes aren't as exotic, but everything they offer tastes like it's their specialty.  I'm particularly fond of the Spicy Bourbon Chicken and the General Tso's Chicken.  The fried rice is notably good, too.  And it's cheap!"
1,"Had an amazing experience while passing through Las Vegas en route to California. While the restaurant was crowded due to popularity on a Sunday morning, we were seated quickly and given time to explore there extensive menu. The service was great and the food even better, especially the banana bread French toast. Can't wait to return to Vegas so we can stop by again!"
0,"Visited aprox 5:30 PM Friday 05/20/2011. An employee was mopping the whole floor with something similar to Pine-sol. Glad we weren't trying to eat inside, gave my wife a headache. My wife's salmon was overcooked as were the Gyoza (potstickers). The salmon was supposed to come with tempura, the receipt was correct, but no tempura. We were already home when she discovered that. The Arizona Bowl was mostly white rice with a little fake(?) crab on top. If you order \""to go\"" check the order before you leave. We will not return."
0,"I enjoyed part of this show, but then I felt like I was watching something like the movie \""Groundhog Day.\""  They dance well, the music was fine, and the sets with the great lighting wowed me.  Then things got stale.  I felt that I was seeing the same dance again and again and again.  How many times can you jump on one hand while turning without it becoming stale.\n\nThere was one irritating thing from one of the crew.  I was in the first row of the rear orchestra.  Unfortunately, one of the sound booth guys decided to stand periodically, and his head was right in the way of the people in my area.  He stood near the end for about 4 minutes while he waited for another tech to come back to the booth.\n\nIt was one of the longest 90 minute shows I've ever seen."
0,"The GF and I have heard so many good things about Binkley's over the years from people that we know that have dined there and from reading reviews online. We finally decided that we had to try it to see how it stacked up against Kai, which is our favorite restaurant in the PHX area. I made reservations for Friday night of Memorial Day weekend a little over a week in advance. Since Binkley's is about 35 miles from the neighborhood that we both live in, we decided to make a weekend of it and stay at The Boulders. The week leading up to the meal, we were both so excited that we both joked that we were getting very little work done due to the anticipation of the amazing meal we were going to have on Friday night.\n\nFriday finally came and we arrived right on time for our 7p reservation. We were promptly greeted by the hostess and promptly seated at the absolute worst table in the house. It was in the bar area, right next to the front door. The most insulting part of it was the hostess tried to tell us what an amazing table it was because the vases of flowers that separated our table from the front door were so pretty. In the grand scheme of things, not a big deal if you wow us with the food. After all, we knew from many reviews that atmosphere is not the strong selling point of the restaurant.\n\nAfter we were seated, we waited for a good 15 minutes before being greeted by a server. This is one of my pet peeves in a fine dining establishment. I like to be greeted promptly by the server and offered a cocktail so I can enjoy a drink while reviewing the menu. Once we were finally greeted we ordered cocktails and enjoyed them when they were finally served. Being that this was our first Binkley's experience, we both decided that we would go \""whole hog\"" and order the 6 course tasting menu with the $50/ea wine pairing. As has been mentioned in may other reviews online, a meal at Binkley's consists of a long parade of amuses. Sadly, in a meal of more misses than hits, the amuses provided more of the hits.\n\nThe big hit of the night was the summer truffle grits that the GF ordered as her hot appetizer. Both of us agreed that these were amazing. Unfortunately, most everything else was relatively forgettable (her halibut fish course was absolutely boring). My quail meat course was quite good, but not something that I would drive 35 miles to experience again.\n\nThroughout the night, the service and the pacing was uneven. Sometimes there was a very lengthy time between courses while other courses were brought to quickly. While our main server was perfectly friendly, she lacked fine dining polish and disappeared for long periods of time (especially when it was time for the check!) several times over the course of the evening.\n\nAs for the wine pairings, those were also hits and misses. The pourings themselves were quite anemic and with long times between courses, there were several times that I had finished my pour before the course even arrived. For a total of $100 between the two of us, I felt the wine was a weak spot in the evening.\n\nThe most entertaining part of the meal was the Gordon Ramsay-esque, f-bomb laced tirade that Chef Binkley went on at some point during the meal. Apparently his kitchen staff wasn't doing things his way and he was letting them know. Quite comical, although a little uncomfortable to other diners around as we could clearly hear every word that he screamed at his staff.\n\nWhen all was said and done, we spent a little over $400 with tip for dinner. While it certainly wasn't the worst meal of either of our lives, we both agreed that it didn't even come near cracking the top 20. We were both glad that we dined at Binkley's to have the firsthand experience, but we both left feeling that it was overrated. Perhaps they were having an off night, maybe it has slipped over the years, or maybe it's just a victim of being over-hyped. Whatever the case, I don't think we will be dining at Binkley's in the future."
1,"Came to buy some flowers and organic fruits.\n\nI picked up Kale that was on sale, Strawberries and red grapes that were deliviously naturally sweetened!\n\nUnfortunately, I had an incident with the flowers when I got into my car, but the staff were very kind to give me a refund since it was a time sensitive issue.\n\nExpect great customer service and knowledgeable staff at this Town Square location \n\nThe cafe is fantastic as well.\n\nDefinitely quality over quantity !"
0,I was checking out of this store and a cashier was eating fried chicken while handling my items. Gross!
1,"This library is a whole different level. Right near the Carnegie Museum you can also take art classes and I assume drop off the rugrats at the library while you \""get your art on\"" next door. They have a very wide variety of books and a nice layout that lends to a feeling of privacy if you want it. Lively without feeling like a daycare center. I found it sort of odd that their feature book section that hits you when you walk in the doors is African American smutty books. I didn't see all of the books at this library but if their collection of A.A erotica is any indication of the breadth of their other genres it is a library of greater magnitude than I have ever seen in all of my nerd filled years."
1,would go again.
1,"It's mall food-court food so there isn't much to say here, but regardless I am a big fan of Sarku Japan! \n\nEvery time I'm in Fashion Square this is where I'll grab a bite to eat. Compared to other fast-food style teriyaki places I really enjoy Sarku. They give you a generous portion all for around $6 after tax, the chicken is never over or undercooked, the service is nice and competent, and most important-- the food tastes good! Try the fried rice or noodles instead of the traditional white rice- it makes for a good substitution to any meal!"
1,"Okay, I went here for breakfast this morning. The food is great, the eggs had a great texture, their made-to-order hash browns were cooked perfectly with just a little crunch and their waffles were light and tasted great with the fresh strawberries and whip cream we got on the side. \n\nWhen I walk into a place like Harlow's two things cross my mind, (1) old which leads to, (2) dirty bathrooms. I rode my bike so I had to go into the bathroom to wash my hands. I braced myself as I expected the worse, but a pleasant surprise was awaiting me! This bathroom experience was awesome! The room was clean, had mirrors on opposite sides which enlarged the space and beautiful wallpaper and porcine tiles. \n\nGreat food, great bathroom, and great service. My top pick for breakfast joints!"
0,If you don't get involved in personal training and just do you own thing this is the perfect gym for you. Otherwise I wouldn't go here. The employees are very rude and if you can't finish the workout in your one free personal training session then you will get made fun of. They are really nice when you sign up but after that they completely ignore you cause they already got you in the door. I would go to mountainside and pay a little more and get treated with respect.
1,"This review is long overdue. I love Bass Pro Shop. There's my review. JK. No really, I love BPS. They have everything I never dreamed I wanted and more. The tough part is sharing your time wisely in each department to guarantee you don't miss anything. \n\nIf I was a millionaire I would rent this place out for a slumber party for myself and fifty of my closest friends. We could sleep in the tent section and eat space food and beef jerky. For entertainment we could play a game of archery or have raft pulling races in the isles. So many activities!!!! I'm especially fascinated by the amount of items you can get in camouflage. Bibles, flasks, aprons, socks, swimsuits, etc. This place is one of my happy places and always puts me in a better mood. \n\nThe only reason they did not get a five star review is because I am irritated that 99% of the classes they offer are for kids so I'm pouting. But all of my friends that are reading this if you ever want to get me a gift this is the store I want a gift card for!!!! Lol."
0,"Disappointed, was really craving a mexican burrito. I ordered a Pollo Asado burrito and what I got was still raw. The chicken was still pink in the middle! I really don't plan on returning ever."
1,"I really wanted this place to be awesome. I really did. It has every ingredient of an awesome poker room: 5 star resort, plenty of tables, and the endorsement of the world's best poker player, Phil Ivey. The thing is, its just not that cool. I don't like the location in the casino itself, its kind of in an awkward, dull corner, that is very unimpressive. They also didn't have as many games running as I had anticipated.\n\n It just seems that everyone was expecting big action to move from Bellagio to Aria once they built a room in honor of Phil, but it just didn't happen. I guess the pros came and sniffed the same thing I did: the musk of mediocrity the surrounds this room. \n\nThat being said there is also nothing wrong with this room. BUT its just not as good as some of the others in Vegas. If you are looking to play 1/2 I would suggest playing at the Mirage (seriously you'd be surpsised). If you are looking to play 2/5, here is fine, Venetian is about the same, and  Bellagio is just a tad better. Anything above 2/5 Bellagio is gonna be way more accommodating."
0,"This may have to be the worst managed repair shop I've even experienced.  Brought my car in for some AC repairs.  They unleashed a self-admitted under performing repair tech ( whom the subsequently fired) on my evaporator.  I go on to pick up my car and find my personal belongings, and a bunch or extra screws and fasteners literally thrown all around the vehicle.  Had to bring it back three times to correct reassembly mistakes, each time the mangers tells me the squeaks and rattles aren't their fault..even thou I give him a handful of saws and fasteners that I found on the floor.   They took my money, did a lousy job and refused to make it right. Run far and fast!"
0,I will NEVER go back to Soyo.  The food actually was not that bad.  However the service was deplorable.  They just don't seem to care.\n\nWe even had Korean speaking people at our table and their lunch was ruined because of the service.
0,"The quality of food was what I had expected for a tapas restaurant in Las Vegas, but even for tapas, I was slightly surprised at the extremely small portions over the higher price. I mean we're talking 2 bites at most if you are sharing (which I was) with somebody else! The Pan con tomate was pretty much the only 4 bites I had in succession on one plate. Think mini food.\n\nThat being said the flavors were spot on and even exceptional when it came to carne asada, the roasted peppers were a great compliment to the slightly spicy beef! My biggest disappointment was with the 'lobster', aka langoustine, which I felt a little lead astray on by our server's description. When asked how large the tail was, she gestured a hand width of about 6 inches. To me, this justified the ~$16 price tag (I can't remember exactly how much it was but it was on the higher end). When it came out, the lavender scented foam was slight, not overpowering, but the meat in the tail was less than that of a large shrimp you find in a neighborhood grocery store. I felt so bad after one nibble, I gave the rest to my boyfriend to try and make up for the fact that I bombed on this suggestion. Other than that, the tempura shrimp were done well with a very nice dipping sauce, and the special (gourmet grilled cheese) was to die for. I mean--how can you go wrong with grilled cheese?\n\nOverall I felt our $120 bill was a little overpriced for the emptiness I still had lingering in my stomach. We did enjoy the experience, however I will skip Jaleo for a meal just as expensive somewhere else knowing that I will walk away without a guilty feeling. I'll leave that to the craps table."
1,"I had close to a 18 inch crack in my front windshield. Initially took it to Safelite and the quote to replace the entire windshield was pretty high. I shopped around Yelp and found Mike's, who quoted me roughly $100 less than Safelite so I gave him a try. \n\nI had no problems scheduling the appt, which I later had to reschedule. He was very accommodating to my schedule. There was no extra charge for him to come out to my condo and replace my windshield. It's been 3 weeks and I've found no issues with the work. Would highly recommend."
1,"Last trip to Vegas, I stopped by here to get some goodies (milk bun, pineapple shortbread, taro bun, etc.) I've never been much for the savory goodies, so I can't speak to them...But for the sweet stuff, this place hits the mark. I loved what I bought so much that I returned the next day for more! Good breakfast foods. The place is nice and clean inside and the selection very good.."
1,"I came here on a Sunday. YES. A Sunday! There was a younger looking girl at the front desk with brown hair who was so nice (which is such a rarity) and everyone I spoke with seemed to listen to me and was really pleasant and helpful. \n\nI was in and out with in 45 minutes, and I really waited almost no time to see a doctor. I got just what I needed, and I am already feeling better. If I ever get sick again, I'd pass up my general practitioner for this place- quick, friendly, efficient."
0,"This place is old, dingy, and outdated. The guests were just as gross as the room I stayed in with a view of a heating unit and a roof. There was a guy actually sitting on the floor on one elevator ride I took. I think he mistook it for the New York New York roller coaster or something from the looks of it which was an oh so charming touch. Oh and the elevators don't work, an employee complained to me about it when I was there.  The time i spent there felt more like a college party gone bad than a vacation. Therefore  I made sure I spent all my time anywhere but this armpit of the Vegas strip. The bed was comfortable but that's the only credit I'll give this place. The room was cheap but I guess my stay here proved you get what you pay for. Next time I go to Vegas I'm not stepping foot near this bunghole of a place."
0,"The food was decent, but we went to eat here last night and it was the worst service I have ever experienced. Our waiter did not bring our credit cards back and we didn't realize it so 2 of us left our cards there, we called back the next morning to see if they had our cards and they told us they didn't have them 3 TIMES. finally the fourth time we called we insisted that they check elsewhere and they found them. Then when we went to get the cards back they were EXTREMELY rude and acted like it was an imposition for us to be there. We will be calling the manager later to speak with them about it. Don't waste your time here, the food isn't good enough for the trouble."
0,"Long line to wait to see what is NOT better view than your hotel window.  Go to dinner instead.  Its not a \""ride\"", its just an elevator to the 30th floor or so...and then u have to look thru chain link.  Save your money."
1,"CRAVINGS BUFFET\nThis is a decent buffet in the Mirage at Las Vegas. It's definitely improved over the years. I recall going there as a kid in the early 90's, where I met tennis star, Michael Chang, and got his autograph. Wide variety of foods here, but fast forward to 2008 and beyond, where the Cravings Buffet has expanded and vastly improved. There is quite an international feel to the buffet, ranging from Americano to Mexicano to Asian (Chinese, Japanese, Vietnamese). Lots of cut meats to choose from and plenty of soups to try! Desserts included cakes, tarts, bread pudding, and a gelato bar! Drinks are free, so drink up if you're into fruit juices: orange, cranberry, apple, etc. Service was great too, as they servers regularly cleaned our tables and refilled our drinks. The food is arrayed around the the dining area in a wide circular arc, making you walk a bit to find your favorite foods (a little exercise within the buffet compound). Not a bad buffet in Las Vegas. Not the best, but hey, it's not Bellagio!"
0,"With a menu that starts with multiple pages of alcoholic beverages, I'm going to guess this is more of a happy hour type of place.  Unfortunately for us, we came here for dinner.  I thought the Garlic Edamame sounded good, but found it to be greasy, soggy and mostly inedible.  The gyoza, sushi and beef teriyaki were all fine but after my disappointment with the edamame, I can't seem to give this place better than a \""meh.\"""
1,"Good ice cream shop. About $5/person, but I don't mind the price for good ice cream. My favorite are the waffle cones. Cinnamon ice cream is pretty good.  Lot of different toppings to choose from. There's also a pretty good atmosphere on the weekends with a live band outside."
1,Great place for casual Mexican fare.  Very flavorful and colorful.  The Chile Relleno was very different and totally enjoyable.  Friendly atmosphere and quick service.\nI have been back a few times to try other items on the menu and I have never been disappointed.
1,Seating wait time: 15mins (Sunday afternoon)\n\nFood time after ordering: 5mins for appetizers 35-40 min for entrees. \n\nFood quality: 5 out of 5\n\nWaiter: 5 out of 5  \n\nMe and my girlfriend walked in on a Sunday afternoon before our long trip home to California. It was our first time there so we had no idea what to expect. It was a bit busy and they do not have much room for waiting. The wait time to be seated was relatively short for the amount of people there. We were able to get our drinks and appetizers really quick after ordering. The problem was the entrees taking too long. The food was really great for a chain restaurant with the enchiladas being the best I've had in a long time. The waiter was great and was keeping us up to date about our food. Overall great restaurant with good food but get four stars due to long food wait times and poor waiting area.
1,"Every time I'm in Las Vegas I stop by this place. Even though I've never seen the same face twice, every face I see is friendly and very cool. I always get my crab and shrimp to go and they always take care of me. \n\nThe prices are a little steep but that's only because they have the crab flown in. I only bring it up for the people who want to know. I have never once considered not going because of the price. Although... one day I hope I can get the large sized crab and not only the regular. \n\nThis is easily my favorite place to eat in Vegas and I can't wait until I go back."
1,"My 3-year old took some beginning dance classes here.  She absolutely loved it, and the owner Melissa!!  The class was great because they did about 20 minutes of ballet, 20 minutes of tap, and then 20 minutes of gymnastics."
1,I have died and gone to heaven. I like everything about the Wynn. It's absolutely oozing with good taste. There is a bar in the middle of the casino that is stunning. The restaurants are so unique with yummy smells emanating from every crevice. The Wynn is modern and tasteful. Playful and funky. I don't see why anyone would want to leave! It's absolutely beautiful. And so is Encore.
1,"Great location, great store! The only reason I took off a star was cause it took me the longest time to find someone who could help me. But once I did they were great! Very nice and helpful."
0,The food is not that good. Nor is the sangria. Firefly has this place beat I'm sorry to say. Good try guys but up your game.
1,"I came here with a group of 7 and we had a delicious meal here the other day. We had:\n\n-Pork belly: very thick cuts of meat (http://s3-media2.ak.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/tORsfO-Tt0huD129gd6moA/l.jpg) which were cooked to perfection\n-Marinated beef: Very flavorful on its own. I didn't have to season it with anything or dip it into any of the sauces.\n-Spicy pork: If you love spicy food, then you will love this. I only had a bite because I couldn't handle it...\n-Beef short ribs: These were probably my favorite of all the meats we tried. They were very tender and went well with all the sauces.  \n-Budae jjigae: This was a special request (not on the menu). I'm not much of a Budae jiggae fan because it's too spicy for me, but Donald said it's the best Budae Jiggae he's had so far. \n-Steamed egg with broth: I was a little skeptical to try this since my last experience with steamed egg wasn't that great, but I actually really loved the steamed egg they served us here. It was almost like custard and it was very light and fluffy. \n-Vinegar based salad: Very very fresh and it actually had some pretty big pieces of onions, but they went very well with the salad (you hardly taste them). \n-Banchan: Our group was divided into two parts and they gave each part 10 little dishes. I don't recall all the names, but I remember there was Seasoned Seaweed, Kongnamul, Kimchi, fish cake, pickled cucumber, potatoes,and Kaktugi. I was so fixated on all the food that was being passed around that I didn't try them all, but I really liked the pickled cucumbers, seaweed, and fish cake.\n-Barley tea: They served the hot tea in plastic cups (the same cups used for water/soda), which was a little odd, but nonetheless, the tea was very tasty.\n\nFrom the moment we walked in, we received excellent customer service. One of our friends is familiar with the place, so she asked if we could be seated at one of the charcoal grill tables. I found it pretty cool that they have both gas and charcoal grills, but they'll just seat you at the gas grill tables if you don't ask specifically for a charcoal grill. We were given a long table with two grills for our large group. The whole restaurant was actually pretty big with a nice layout. All the grills and tables are spaced out in small sections, so it makes for more intimate dining. \n\nWe had about 3 waitresses taking care of our table. One would keep refilling our beverages (they gave us both tea and water), one would be cooking the food for us, and the other would keep the table clean and refill the banchan. There was never anything we needed because they were totally on top of everything; Definitely A+ service.\n\nOverall, I love this place. I live in the SW part of town though, so I probably won't be here that often, but this will definitely be my go-to spot for Korean food when I'm in this area."
0,The only positive thing I can say is that this place is one of the less expensive options for breakfast. I ordered the Napoleon and I could have made a better crepe myself - and I'm not even a good cook! It was made with frozen berries that tasted like rubber. Will not be coming back here. Le Village Buffet right across from La Creperie must have a long line for a reason.
1,"Had a fun night here.  I haven't been to a hooka bar in 10 years!  We went for drinks and hooka.  Staff was friendly, decor is nice.  They are a bit pricey but I guess that can be expected in old town!"
1,"As a native East Coaster, for YEARS, I have heard about the myth & the mystery surrounding In & Out Burger. I've been to California multiple times; it eludes me why I never made it to In & Out Burger then. Then recently, I was visiting my brother in Las Vegas when I saw the In & Out Burger sign. For some reason, I assumed it was a California thing, as opposed to a West Coast thing. Easy decision. I had the Double Double. I'm a fan, no doubt. Certainly one of the Top 5 burgers I've had ever. Everything about it is right: it's simple, it's juice, the beef really stands out. With things like heart disease, it's a good thing I don't live on the West Coast!"
1,"Phoenix needs Mary Coyle and Sugar Bowl because, if anything, they serve as a tasty time capsule to another time.  It also helps that Mary makes the best raspberry shakes this side of Bear Lake, Utah."
0,What can I say at least have better   service  I did spend 2k .... To bad Karen wasn't there she help us the week prior to buying the purse she's really nice .... The last who help was a bit boring and awkward didn't  really talk to us
1,"Missing the home inspection on my first ever home purchase seemed like the worst idea in the world, but Gordy made me feel at ease that he would do an excellent job.\n\nGordy sounded extremely knowledgeable on the phone.  Being that we were from out of town, Gordy proceeded to explain the types of common problems to expect in Las Vegas homes, and what we should be looking out for.  He answered every question we asked, and suggested since we were out of town that he was willing to call us immediately after the inspection to give us the run down of the house.  PLUS he would be willing to COME BACK once we were in town again to show us how to properly maintain the house and point out what was wrong in person.\n\nI was sold.\n\nWe scheduled the appointment as soon as we were sure the utilities would be on, and true to his word, Gordy arrived at the house (early) and called us right afterwards and spoke to us for well over an hour on the phone.   We got the full walk through, followed by an extremely detailed written report with lots of photos highlighting every issue.  I'd opted for the thermal imaging, and it was enlightening to see where we had insufficient insulation and where there were water leaks.  I came away feeling like Gordy left no stone unturned. Not only that, but Gordy called us back AGAIN after he had emailed the report to make sure we understood it and reiterated multiple times that he wouldn't ever hesitate to answer any questions we had.\n\nOverall, a fantastic experience.  I wouldn't hesitate to recommend Gordy!"
0,It was good! But the wonton ooOomg there was nothing inside and I called the restaurant and the lady said there was only Tiiiiiiiny tiny bits of chicken! LOL Wich is a lie cos there was none!!! \nWhy Lie?
0,"Damn, I thought after all the hoopla this place was supposed to have the BEST chicken fried steaks in Phoenix....IT DOESN T...now I m from Texas and in all my 62 years , i have not had a more greasy,soggy,limp chicken fried steak....YUCK...what a load of crap this thing was. The rest of the place was a  dump..the bathroom had to be shared with employee changing his clothes...small is the word...I would bet you if Gordon Ramsey or the health dept inspected this dump the kitchen would be closed first thing....save your money and time, go back to Texas every now and then, go to the Market Diner on Harry Hines in Dallas and eat a REAL GOOD chicken fried  steak with fresh cream gravy and not that congealed goo from the texaz GRILL...I have had better from roadside vendors but nothing worse than the imitation chicken fried steak this place serves instead.....lazy @#$%'s"
0,"good prices but its a little like shopping in Mexico.  Some products prices are mismarked so that you think you are paying one price but upon checkout it is much more expensive.  They dont remidy this problem even after I point out the discrepency in prices.  Next time I come back its still mismarked with a lower price.\nAlso, I brought back a bag of  food that had a rip in the package to exchange a new bag and while they exchanged it, they put the ripped bag right back on the shelf.  Customer service stinks in this place.  I feel like I am bothering the employees if I need to ask them something."
0,"I read reviews for movies, restaurants and products all the time. How did I forget to read the reviews before dropping $200 on this show I don't know. I've always wanted to see it. I heard they changed it after a performer died, but I still thought it would be good. I was wrong. I wish I had seen it years ago before they changed it. We were not impressed, and there's too many other shows to see.  It was my girlfriends first Cirque show, and she didn't like it. Where's the acrobatics she asked? I didn't have an answer, as I was wondering the same thing. Go see Mystere or O at Bellagio if you want a Cirque de Soleil show, chances are you'll be disappointed with this one."
1,"I was referred to Edgewood Dental Associates by a friend (who happens to be a doctor). My experience was so positive I feel compelled to pass on this great find. The staff is professional and friendly - they looked up what my insurance covered before I sat down.  They keep digital records (vs. old skewl film x-rays) and you can book your appointment online and do your paperwork in advance.  The office is clean and up-to-date. Plus, the reception area has nice amenities - espresso, current magazines etc.\nhttp://www.edgewooddentalassociates.com/"
1,Very nice and well run concert venue. Very small and like the size of a High School gym. There is a balcony that offers a great view of the stage and a well stocked if not expensive bar in the back. Since the place is small the sound was great from wherever I stood.
1,"We will be coming back here soon! Service is great considering how busy they were. I like the self-serve area for salsa, lemons, cucumber, and pickled carrots. The hubby and I shared the menudo (very good) and two of 5 different tacos. The menudo was served with hot corn tortillas and a small generous bowl of chopped onion and cilantro. It was tasty and it wasn't greasy like others we've tried. The cabeza and lengua tacos were our favorite! The pork carnitas, carne asada, and pastor were a bit dry, but still flavorful. We hardly used any salsa with our tacos because they were so good! Our agua frescas were delicious as well. I had the horchata and hubs had tamarindo.\n\nOverall, this place is above average for service, quality, taste, cleanliness, and decor. The bathroom is lacking big time due to the size as well as lack of toilet paper, and hand paper towels. When I walked in there, a large trash bin was on top of the toilet seat, giving the impression that the toilet was out of order."
1,"Luncha Libre catered an event we attended last week. We had an exciting combo of tacos - from Thai Style, Steak/Gorgonzola to Bacon shrimp. All were amazing - we couldn't agree on a group favorite because they were all so unique and so darned good. Friendly staff, great food, and worth tracking down. Am looking for an excuse to have them cater an event at our place next!"
0,"Despite a scathing review a few weeks ago we decided to keep the reservation we had made for New Years Eve. Then a couple of days ago we were pleased to learn a new chef had been brought in from another restaurant.I wish I could say this was a great meal but it was not.\nThe ambiance and the decor was lovely. Our server was a true professional. When we brought concerns to his  attention he immediately tried to make things right.\nSome highlights... The wedge salad, the chicken entree, my French Gimlet and the lobster bisque. The just okay....the steaks, the broccoli, the pie, the creme brulee and the bread. The bad...the garlic mashed potatoes which were touted by the waiter. They were dry, tasteless and cold. The hashbrowns were also cold. It should be noted that the potatoes were targeted in the bad review. The chocolate cake was unremarkable.\nThe manager was open to feedback which was a good sign. I do love the location and the decor. I so hope the necessary changes area made.\nFood Fight must step up their game. They know how to make a restaurant pleasing to the eye and now they have to deliver to the palette. I know I am not only person that misses Firefly. I rue the day Texas Tubbs moved in.\nEating out has become a luxury. Mediocrity is not acceptable. \nHere's to a delicious New Year!"
0,"I love Paradise Bakery, just not this one. On too many occasions have they messed up my order or not had key ingredients for main sandwhiches. I keep returning based on convenient location to my home but no more. \n\nSave your money for another location or different restaurant."
0,"I was really excited to see the show but walked out of the theater underwhelmed.   So far, this is my least favorite show; even the guy next to me fell asleep during the show.  I felt the performers were holding back and afraid to go all out."
1,"This is definitely one of the best pizza places in Las Vegas, it makes you feel like you're back in New York again. The quality of deli meats, pastas and desserts is amazing. They make a white pizza with clam sauce and shrimp which is addictive. The chicken champagne is also out of this world. Stop in for a sandwich for lunch or a pasta entree or pizza for dinner and you can't go wrong. But absolutely stop in!"
0,"There's a sign inside of Al's that reads, \""The Best Sandwiches in America.\"" That title must have been self proclaimed. The BEST sandwiches in America? Hardly!\n\nI work in North Scottsdale and know that the area is saturated with restaurants, particularly sandwich shops. I have my pick of the litter, so to speak, but on this day I dropped in on Al's, which I'd heard was new to the area. Someone in my office had tried the place so I figured I'd give it a go. The restaurant itself is nice, afterall, it's North Scottsdale and everything there is just a little bit nicer than everywhere else. I have no qualms with the decor. It's the food and the service I take issue with. \n\nNow, I used to work in the food industry, albeit, fast food, but food nonetheless. I know what it's like to serve people since I was a cashier. A cashier should reflect the face of the business, and a positive one at that, if they hope to make any money. The cashier who greeted me at Al's was anything but friendly. She was cordial but bordering on being annoyed, either at me directly or over the fact that she had to work that day. Regardless of her reason, she made me feel like I was a burden to her, instead of feeling welcome. \n\nI'd taken a quick look at the menu, which was pretty basic. There were french fries in various states of being drowned in either bleu cheese or nacho sauce. No thanks, I passed on those. There were hot dogs, sausage and beef sandwiches, their signature dish. I, however, decided to take a healthier route and went with the char-grilled, grilled onion chicken sandwich for around six bucks. Everything is a la carte there, as there are no \""value meals.\"" Fine. I paid my $6 and got a glass of water. I sat down and waited for my order to come up....and I waited, and waited. Finally, after 15 minutes, (which to me, seems like a long time for one chicken sandwich) it came up. This better be a darned good chicken sandwich, I thought to myself.\n\nI unwrapped the foil wrapper and dug in. The roll was light and fluffy but that's where the good stuff ends. The onions were cut in such a way that they all fell out of the sandwich. Had they been able to stay on the sandwich they may have lended some flavor to it.The chicken itself was dry and tasteless. If it wasn't for the fact that it was drowned in ketchup and mustard (dripping down my arm) there would be no flavor at all. What really bothered me the most was the dry texture of the chicken coupled with the dryness of the roll. I had to take sips of water to keep my mouth from drying out. \n\nOverall, my experience at Al's was not so good. The service was mediocre and the food was even worse. Even though I only tried one thing on the menu I am not tempted to go back to try anything else. I have to believe that if this sandwich was of bad quality then the rest of their food will be the same. I'm sorry to say, but there were no redeeming qualities about the sandwich shop that claims to have \""The Best Sandwich In America.\"""
0,For $20 at the side door Andrew will let you skip the line. This place is over rated.
0,"We went to the Happy Hour at Outback tonight and really enjoyed our meal and the very attentive service of it's wait staff. \n\nThe food was good, not great mind you but good. Hey, this isn't Morton's but it's a friendly staff wants your repeat business. Enjoy!"
0,"12/03/12\n\nHmm... I could've sworn I had written a review of this place before.  At the very least, I uploaded a few pics of our breakfast here many months ago.  Took my Mom to try the oven-baked pancakes once.  Do yourself a favor and pass on these!  Guess the review AND photos were taken down.  (Let's see how long this NEW review sticks before it's taken down, too.)\n\nCousin texted me yesterday and asked if I'd join her for breakfast at JP Pancake today, and I texted her back guessing that it was too late to warn her not to buy the Groupon... Yes, it was.  I thought it would be a good opportunity to see if JP had improved on its service and food prep.  As you can see, it hasn't...\n\nWe arrived around 7:35 am to see a deserted parking lot with the exception of one car parked in front of JPP.  It looked like we were the only souls there, besides our server and the cook in the kitchen.  I thought perhaps we'll get better service this time, since we were the only customers.  The young man asked us to sit wherever we wanted, handed us the menus and asked if we'd like some coffee or juice to start with.  I asked for coffee, while my two cousins settled on hot cocoa.  He said he'd see if they had any in the back first.  He came back a few minutes later with their mugs of cocoa (Swiss Miss and canned whip cream) and said he'd be back with my coffee.  Upon his return, we placed orders of a \""Golden brown\"" waffle ($6.25), two full orders of French toast (one with strawberries, one with bananas, $7.95 per), and two sides of bacon (3 pieces each, $3.25 per).  I later asked if the side of ham is off-the-bone, and after consulting with the cook, he came back with a \""yes.\""  I placed a late order of that, as well.  \n\nWhile the service was good (food arrived fast, server checked back to see how we were doing), the breakfast we had wasn't as good.  Our French toast slices http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/jp-pancake-scottsdale?select=Q5s2HavHzD9RrGJOUbx0NA#Q5s2HavHzD9RrGJOUbx0NA were very dry-- the menu stated challah bread, but I think it was more like cake, and the slices could've used a longer soak in the egg batter.  Out of the six halves on my cousin's plate, she only had one (and all but one of her berry slices!), while I had one slice and a quarter of another of my platter.  I would've suggested we share a plate, but she didn't want to get bananas, and I didn't want any berries...  As I've said, the only winner this morning was the waffle, and I think the dollops of butter had a lot to do with its success.  (Also, I brought my own bottle of organic pure maple syrup, since most restos offer up a non-organic cane and corn syrup blend.  My cousin tried mine first before trying the restaurant's own syrup, ditched that, and then used mine until she was finished eating.)  Their sides of bacon http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/jp-pancake-scottsdale?select=OP_6MgCnCpDWtxi8JJAijg#OP_6MgCnCpDWtxi8JJAijg were very costly, considering that these were very thin slices and VERY greasy (even for bacon!).  I wouldn't hesitate paying $3.50 for a very nice plate of THICK-SLICED bacon, all-natural even, but these were pathetic-looking.  As unfortunate-looking as they were, however, they did save breakfast for my cousins.  As for the miniature slice of ham http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/jp-pancake-scottsdale?select=cHiSI19XYV1wUDemaXumCA#cHiSI19XYV1wUDemaXumCA I was presented with, I sent that back.  I may have been a fool to agree to waste my calories on a horrible breakfast this morning (thinking it was time to give JPP another chance for improvement), but I'm not that big a fool to allow my cousin to be charged another $3.25 for a paltry serving!\n\nAlso, zero props to our server who freaked my cousin out by hugging the wall by the kitchen with what I thought was the hope of keeping out of our vision while being able to hear our conversation without success!  Her sister confirmed seeing this behavior and thought it was very creepy, too.  I wished they'd alerted me sooner (by asking me to switch seats) so that I could see what they were talking about.  Overall, what a lousy way to spend $35* and a breakfast meal out!  :(\n\n*Original ticket was just under $45, which showed the order charges totaling under $38 before tax.  If you account for Scottsdale's food tax of 8.95%, what was the extra $3, or so, for?  A hidden tip?  Finding this hidden charge was surprising, because our server did not know we were using a Groupon.  There was a sign on the door that stipulated that all Groupon customers will be charged an 18% tip at checkout, and my cousin did not mention her Groupon until we were given the check.  Perhaps, just perhaps, JPP assumes that all of their customers are Groupon-users?  Not far-fetched, since the Yelp reviews can't be helping JPP these days..."
0,"There was a flyer on my door from this place. Decided to give it a try today, the lunch specials sounded good and at a reasonable price. My boyfriend and I ordered the lettuce wraps as an appetizer, I ordered the orange chicken, and he ordered the Mongolian beef. The main dish comes with a small salad before the meal comes out. The salad wasn't bad kind of small, maybe a little too much dressing. Then we got our appetizer.............I will never ever EVER eat here again! The lettuce wraps came out and it looked quite delicious, as we started eating it I discovered a hair in the dipping sauce for the lettuce wraps. It wasn't a big deal we hadn't eaten it, so we just asked for a new bowl of dipping sauce. Then as we looked at the filling for the lettuce wraps we discovered that the entire dish was filled with short black hairs. We have never had this happen before!!! They just opened up not too long ago, I can't believe this would happen!!!!!!! Needless, to say I will NEVER be going back here again!!!"
1,"I love the pan fried noodles with chicken. The sauce is delicious and just enough of the noodles are crispy. I think it's actually the only main dish I've ever ordered there because I love it so much. The service is consistently slow and I've been there a few times when they've mixed up orders. One time, I was there with as part of a party of 4. They gave my dish to another group, gave me the wrong dish and it took them like half an hour for them to get me my food. Meanwhile, the rest of my group was finishing up by the time I got mine. It was infuriating.\nFood - consistently awesome - 5 stars\nService - sooooo sllooooowwww - 1-2 stars"
1,This little restaurant was very good! Tried the Local Plate and Ross J's Special Plate. Both of these were very good! The fried chicken on the special was insane and the Spam Musubi was spot on. Overall atmosphere was casual and friendly. Would definitely come back here!
1,"My niece requested Chompie's while in town visiting from the east coast. It is a safe selection since there is something for everyone. Unless you hate food, there is bound to be something you like.  Except if you are my grandma, who was not pleased that the tongue listed on the menu was not available. \n\nBut, really, out of all the burgers, omelets, smoked fish, salads and schnitzel on the menu, why would one want to order tongue in the first place? Just get pastrami!\n\nShe did order wine to drown her sorrow, which arrived in an impressively large and  filled to the rim wine glass. It was perhaps the largest serving of wine I have seen at a restaurant.  In my opinion, this totally outweighs the lack of beef tongue.  My impossible-to-please grandmother may disagree, but luckily she cannot remember how to operate the web browser on her computer to write Yelp reviews.\n\nWe usually go to the Tempe location but I was just as pleased with the Chandler location. Perhaps more pleased for the following two reasons:\n1) In addition to the complimentary pickles, there was also complimentary bread. This may not be specific to location, it could just be a new implementation. Regardless, I like bread.  \n2) In addition to the normal sampling of crumb cake at the bakery counter, there was also sampling of cookies.  FULL-SIZED COOKIES.  Nothing starts a meal better than a chocolate dipped, sprinkled covered, buttery cookie. Well played, Chompies, well played.\n\nAs always, they had a display case full of temptations: 7 layers of chocolate cake, cupcakes doubled in height by frosting, and cookies the size of Frisbees.\n\nAnd, as if their menu was not big enough, they had added quite a few new options, such as a kale salad and flat-bread pizzas.  Everything was very tasty and as usual, my brother made it a personal challenge to eat as much food as possible (he managed 4 sliders and a plateful of onion rings). It was fascinating and horrified my grandmother, who just couldn't bring herself to look away."
0,"Took my two year old here the other day and was charged $6 for her to paint and was also charged half the adult fee because \""I helped her\"".  She's two.  This should have been discussed up front. My wife was going to bring our daughter back next week but we won't be coming back if this is how the business is run.  What a shame."
0,i stopped coming her because im not a fan. the servers all have attitudes and the food isnt the best.
1,"You need only remember three words when you visit this restaurant.  Braised short ribs.  You will never taste anything so divine anywhere else.  The meat is so tender that a gentle nudge from your fork is all you need to begin your journey to heaven.\n\nI only gave 4 stars because we discovered during our second visit to this restaurant, which was during August last year, they were using white wine to braise the meat instead of red wine!  What a difference.  The chef was going for a 'lighter' taste and it just did not work as well.  The dish was still delicious and it's worth ordering, but once you've been spoiled with the original red wine version, it was a little disappointing.  Maybe the chef will realize that you can't improve perfection and go back to the red wine."
0,"We ate at Lon's the evening after our wedding a year ago and had a memorable experience. A year later was a different story. Ambiance is beautiful on the patio. In reality the food is decent. Good quality but the older well established restaurants in Phx are notorious for relying heavily on butter, cream and oil for flavor. If you've lived elsewhere you know what I am referring to. Lon's is no different but does this 'genre' nicely anyhow. We arrived 10 min prior to res on Sunday. I'd made a note on res as to our history, wanting to make this our annual tradition and a 'go-to' spot as we live a 10 min walk away. Gent at front didn't even look up from computer screen and basically said 'just wait a bit.' Thirty minutes after res time we were seated. No offer of drinks in the meantime. Love the ambiance. Food was late, lukewarm, very heavily oiled and salty as heck (salmon and tenderloin). No sincere attempt from Lon's at making this memorable. I did not expect any sort of freebie or handout, just a sincere acknowledgment that someone had taken just a second to read what I had written on our on-line reservation about this special occasion for us. I realize we aren't the only couple to have an anniversary at Lon's but it is special for us and of all the restaurants in the Valley we chose to Lon's in hopes of beginning a long tradition. The server was very nice, Robert I believe. He did welcome us warmly and acknowledged our anniversary and we were happy with his attentiveness.  May give Lon's another try as we all have off nights but not for a special occasion."
1,"The Lazy River on the website is what initially drew me in, and am I glad it did! \n\nThe front desk is totally accommodating with taxis to airport, directions to local dining areas, changing rooms for a quieter scene. \n\nThen, the spa is to die for. Try the turquoise massage. You'll never want to leave. \n\nThen, the pool area is full of great waiters and waitresses- ready to serve and bring over some poolside cocktails or food. \n\nEnd the night with some beers by the the firepits. Ooo la la. \n\nOverall, a beautiful resort that is centrally located. Right across from an outdoor mall, 20 minutes from Scottsdale, 3.5 hours from Grand Canyon."
1,"Service here is always prompt, thoughtful(suggestions galore) and steady... and valet parking is a short stroll from the nearby Aria entrance. The ambiance is airy and open, and the bar setup (fruit instead of fake tapas) is witty and hip for a tapas-style spot. \n\nTapas: I begin each meal with a cheese plate(highly recommended) or the pan manchego? So far, I most enjoy the salmon with truffle(I often order two) and some other seafood dish I cannot presently recall. Lobster gazpacho is a must for those who(like moi) generally hate gazpacho or cold blends. Other notables, thus far: raspberry tuna dish(it actually works!), lobster salad, huevos estrellados, bass(Oprah-aaaaammazing, lol!), chorizo. The flan here is intricate and delicious.\n\nOne dish I hate here is the steak featured on the tapas menu. It tasted like mediocre sirloin... I admittedly--owing to its horrible texture--consider sirloin essentially dog food. I've never tried the paella but was informed that it tastes just like Spain's, which is not a good thing. To explain: paella(with or without saffron) is a stupid idea. Simply read the ingredients/preparation and you will sigh with comprehension... I call paella culinary meth, lol. If you insist on an entree the filet mignon(or I imagine any seafood or pork dish here) is a pleaser.\n\nImpeccable texture and taste overcome (merely above average) presentation at this spot--one of my faves for lunch or silly dinners. On my last visit, I enjoyed a quick bite/wine at the bar with friends. I have yet to try the early eve special but it sounds like a killer deal.    \n\n4 stars rather than 5 because some of the flavors repeat (a few dishes beg for drizzles; others for acidity to combat the olive oil and make things more spanish and less greek); however, I wish I could give 4.5 stars b/c they serve tender octopus And delicious fried calamari that doesn't even need the sauce or lemons."
1,"I have always loved Pei Wei as I'm an asian food lover from the SF Bay Area and I definitely have a sense for what's good and what's not.  Some might question the authenticity of their food, and I'm not asian so I don't consider myself to be an authority.  I do, however, LOVE the Pad Thai with chicken and tofu and everytime I order it, I'm in heaven :)  The portion is huge, seriously enough for 2-3 meals, the flavor is excellent, it's a little greasey which adds to the texture of the rice noodles, the chicken breast pieces are more than abundant and the tofu has a fabulous texture.  The crushed peanuts, lime and cilantro create a party in my mouth!!!\n\nYou just can't beat the overall quality, service and price.   It makes joints like Panda Express look embarrassing by comparison.  I like the fact that Pei Wei also rotates in new menu items (Sesame Chicken is new) and you can order brown rice as an option."
0,"I was there today after 1:00 with very few people in the establishment. There wasn't a clean table in the entire restaurant. Further, there was food on the floor and it was downright filthy. After asking for a table to be cleaned so my friend and I could sit and eat, the cashier very lazily slopped a wet towel on a table and threw the trash from the table onto the floor. While the food is OK, this place needs management desperately! Will never return!"
1,"I work at the AZ Center and thought I would try Pallet during my lunch break. Ordered the BQ Steak Sandwich. Great flavor, wasn't over or under cooked and the meat was very tender. Very well done by the chef. Reading all recent and latest reviews and I just can't help from noticing, since The Local restaurant next door just opened, there as been more of negative review on the Pallet from recent past history reviews which Pallets has been receiving.  HOW IRONIC!! ALL Restaurants will have good and bad reviews but please  owners don't get friends to negatively review a restaurant because they are your competitors. The Pallet could do things better like most restaurants All in All its a Very Good Restaurant"
0,"Mediocre at best.  See that delicious looking picture up there that shows you how great the chicken tenders are?  Well that's exactly what I ordered, except for mine, they came fried a little extra.  I might be being kind with that.  The were fried extra to the point where each bite tasted of burnt coating.  No matter what I dipped them in I still tasted the burnt-ness.\n\nNext time I order from here, I'll make sure to order something that doesn't come from the fryer."
0,Worse club ever. They advetisted  free drinks for ladies but was not true then once got inside there was nobody in there. Dance floor was empty.  Go somewhere else
1,"I shopped around quite extensively to find a great engadgement ring. I found Brian at the perfect time. Not only did I get to pick from a large variety of high quality diamonds the ring was 100% custom and designed by me for that special touch. A custom ring may sound expensive too. It was cheaper than the big name places for a larger, clearer, and better cut diamond. You will not go wrong here."
1,"I have been to this location 3 times for lunch and dinner in addition to the original in Brooklyn. My expectations of a restaurant start with how long it takes to get seated, how long it takes before we are greeted by our waitress, how long it takes to get our food and if our waitress follows up with how are meal is and if are drinks are full. In my opinion, Grimaldi's surpasses all expectations.\nThis particular restaurant is great and this is why.\n\n1. Staff was prompt and friendly\n2. Food is amazing and love the decor\n3. Management came to our table on more than one occasion to see if we were   enjoying our food and if we needed anything. It had a family feel as if your grandmother was making sure you were taken care of.\n\nMy wife and I get our pizza with pepperoni and extra basil, it is simply fantastic but the plain cheese and basil is more that satisfactory. get the large, it is only $2 more. We make sure to go here every time we visit Las Vegas. One last thing that made me enjoy this restaurant even more. There was an older couple next to us that looked as if they were from Duck Dynasty or some other hillbilly lifestyle. They were basically old school Vegas and I thought it was fantastic that this nice restaurant was a place of diversity where you can see a redneck, someone in a suit or a family. Great food is for all to enjoy."
1,"We love Mei Wei.  We often go for lunch- it is delicious and includes soup, salad, egg roll, rice and main dish for a very reasonable price.  The staff is super friendly.  We have done take out via delivery and were really pleased.  I would recommend you try this tiny,  quaint little restaurant- the food is delicious and the staff are great."
1,"This place is the perfect location for drinks before/after a show at the Overture! I wish they were open when I used to live down here. There's a pool table, and the place feels very spacious. I wish they had more sofa-like seating though. I can imagine people playing board games down here."
0,"Meh... We stumbled upon this place on our way back from Rock Hill to Charlotte. We were hungry and hung over and said, \""what the heck\"". Oddly, the first thing that I noticed, aside from the cliche feel of everyone Mexican-themed restaurant in the USA decorations, was that NONE of the waitstaff was Hispanic. HAHA! I don't think I'd ever seen that  before.\n\nOur waiter greeted us nearly as soon as we walked through the door. He was very polite and professional if not nearly uncomfortably nervous. But I think that was just his soft-spoken way.\n\nThe place was nearly empty but then again it was noon on a Sunday so most folk in the area were prolly at church or something. Our waiter sat us and even made some suggestions and clarifications about the menu which is always welcomed.\n\nFirst off the chips; they were NOT bad by any stretch of the imagination. But they looked like they came out of a bag instead of made in their kitchen. Albeit, they were nicely hot but they were all the same exact shape and thickness and they just looked overall unnaturally processed. they were pretty standard and tasted like Santitas (the commercially available bag you can get at any grocery store). The salsa, although bland, was surprisingly spicy. I mean, it gave my tongue a nice sear all around. Becky noticed it too. Not much in the way of flavor though.\n\nThe biggest black mark here, which is pretty negligible in the grand scheme of things, is that they brought our plates one at a time. Becky ordered some meat with chile sauce which came first. They put the plate in front of her and I had to wait a few minutes before mine arrived. I ordered an entree with two burritos.\n\nNone of the food was anything to write home about. Just another Mexican-themed restaurant in the seemingly interminable sea of sameness.\n\nAll in all, I had a decent meal at a forgettable establishment that we'll probably not go out of way to revisit... unless we're driving back from Rock Hill to Charlotte really hung over again."
0,"I was so excited for this location. The first time I came here, I was immediately pleased by the warm, pleasant and cozy atmosphere. Their servers were nice, but they messed up my order. They messed up two different times, with two different people. My huge order that was this confusing? A brownie. Luckily, their manager was able to fix it and actually give me the brownie that I ordered. Wonderful. I also decided to order a cup of their turkey dumpling soup, which I couldn't enjoy. Why? The turkey and dumpling soup Kneader's offers is a soup with a couple pieces of turkey and a half a biscuit in it. I was as confused as you are. Today, I decided to give it another chance and order a salad. Impossible to screw up, right? That's what I thought too. So, when I pulled up to the drive thru and the kind woman told me to go ahead and look at the menu and that'd she be with me in a minute I didn't mind much. I waited about five minutes before she finally got back to me and ordered their chicken raspberry nut salad. I get to the window, pay, and wait. And wait. And wait. And wait. To give you an idea of how long I waited: the same girl that took my order and that I paid with, opened the window and asked me if I had been helped yet about ten minutes later. Another five or so minutes go by and I finally get my food. Did I mention that I was the only car there? No one behind or in front of me. This is the last time I will ever go to Kneader's. Besides the horrendous first visit and long wait on my second, the actual salad was the last straw. The \""chicken raspberry nut salad\"" promised spinach, chicken, fresh berries, feta, candied walnuts, and onions (I ordered without onions). There were no berries and two walnuts. Seriously. I then opened the dressing and as you can see in the picture it's almost laughable. There's been some pretty bad places in surprise, but Kneader's is near the top of the list. The prices don't help much either. Do yourself a favor and go somewhere else. Even Paradise Bakery is better than this place."
1,Most amazing school! Teachers care... Staff is amazing & professional.... The level of care is incomparable to any other school in NV... Have 2 kids here. Blessed! Highly reccomend. My kid absolutely love school!!
1,"I've only ever been here for happy hour on a week day, so I can only comment on my experience at the bar. Even on a week day, there was a 30+ minute wait for a table, however, we were perfectly fine scoring two seats at the bar. We ordered drinks and were able to order some \""saucy balls\"" as an appetizer. \nThe vibe at the bar has a very luxurious feel, and the drink menu is extensive. Lots of after-work, happy hour people. I also only was able to stay at the bar on the bottom level, I did not venture to the upstairs. \nFor the happy hour crowd, I would say the bar was a little understaffed. I am not sure if there was an event going on that time, or if they are usually this busy on a week night, but they could have used at least one more person behind the bar.\nI thought the food was delicious and quick to come out.\nI also ordered the cheese and olive plate, which was perfect with my cab sauv.\nHighly recommend for after-work dinner or drinks!"
0,"Imitation BBQ for a city that doesn't know better.\n\ntheir pulled pork is so dry, maybe it's made a few days before or very far off site, they are pretty cheap on the sauce and the fries are certainly nothing to write home about.\n\nIf you know SW BBQ and are jonesing it may have to do though."
0,"Went in for dinner and had the chopped mediterranean salad and it was not what I was expecting. The salad came with garbanzo beans but it was 70% garbanzo beans on mine. A friend also chose the chopped mediterranean salad and her portion of garbanzo was maybe 20%. I really wanted to send my salad back but was left to eat it after waiting almost 15 minutes for our waiter to make an appearance only to disappear within seconds. He eventually returned 10 minutes later and it was too late.\n\nThe restaurant was pretty empty when we were seated which leads me to believe the waiter was watching the NBA finals on tv instead of servicing his tables.\n\nNice bar and outside area, service need a a little polishing, and food needs a little work as well. Not saying I won't be back but ill give it a year."
1,"My buddy and I had brunch here before our day at the MIM and wow, what a great experience!\n\nWe are totally \""those\"" people, he's a vegetarian and I'm dairy free. I know, I know, annoying. Tryst totally doesn't mind! Their menu caters to all types of tastes and requirements. They proudly serve a creative and organic menu.\n\nWe each had a spicy Bloody Mary. Fricken delicious, they're made with cucumber vodka and all sorts of veggies: olives, pickled green beans, celery, cherry tomato. The works. Totally hit the spot.\n\nI had the Huevos Rancheros. Anytime I see this offered in a menu, I get it, so I'm kind of an expert. I wasn't overly impressed, but it was all right. There were way too many tortilla strips, which made the dish hard to manage. It was more like a \""build your own\"" since all the ingredients were separated on the plate. Good flavor though.\n\nThe service was great as well, you could tell the girl was knowledgable and fun. The manager (or owner?) also stopped by to check on us and was super friendly.\n\nIt's really nice to have a small mom and pop type eatery in the land of chain restaurants and shops. \n\nHighly recommended!"
1,"This funky little eatery in the South End has grown quite a bit (not in size, but in appeal) over the last few years.  What started as not much more than a rather ugly yellow cinder block building on an oddly-shaped lot is now that and more - they've added some landscaping, a paved lot instead of the gravel parking and a nice outdoor eating area too.  Inside the food is the same great, simple combinations you're used to getting.\n\nThe cramped quarters also haven't changed much, but that's just part of the appeal.  As strange as it may sound, the sheer volume that moves through this place makes it possible to place your order and get a table by the time the order is ready - provided everyone cooperates and doesn't hog their table out of their place in line.  When you're done, get up and let someone else have the table, and everything keeps moving as it should.\n\nTable tops still contain business cards from around town, and there is plenty of artwork to see as well, and the atmosphere is worth coming for, but it's the food that should keep you coming back.  While the burrito is the namesake of the place, make sure you try the quesadilla too.  They are excellent."
1,"So delicious! Came here during a lay over at 11pm. Lots of good side dishes. \nI normally dont like meat, but the korean short ribs was so sweet and yummy that I finished the entire plate. \nSeafood tofu was a winner."
0,"I made a yelp account just so I can give this place a one star. I had a groupon so I came here with my sister. We first waited at the front door for a minute while they were talking in the backroom. I even said/yelled a hello nd I had to finally go to the bar area and then when this asain waitress saw me she came out. After being seated we got some menus, nd as it was my second time giving this place a chance AGAIN they did not have half the menu. the drinkS ( plural )  nope. Asked for less ice and the reply was you will get it in a smaller glass then, the burger i wanted nope, oh even the chips and salsa that are suppose to come with the food they didnt have. Apparently they were serving fruit with a BURGER today. Hmmm one strawberry nd pickle literally half the size of my pinky. Nice excuse of being out of that also, not substituted with fries which is an extra cost with the burger but one strawberry, are you not suppose to put the customer first. Then my sisters food came with a hair in it nd we told our server nd of course the server compares the hair size to my sisters. Are u kidding me. After the food we presented the groupon to the asain waitress who looks at my sister like we stole the phone nd asks for id. I would give it no stars if I had an option. That lady is straight out rude, i think she owned the place because she was on her phone and laptop the whole time  in a corner, no service what so ever. NEVER AGAIN WILL I COME TO THIS PLACE. I WOULD RECOMMEND AGAINST IT IN EVERY WAY. The food ( Cajun Burger ) had no flavor to it at all. There was bland meat and one portion somewhat in the middle that tasted somewhat cajun but thats it..."
0,Sucks. Not fresh.!!.not Japanese style at all. super Slow !! Waitress are like sleeping.. chefs are playing....
0,We bought a deal from RJ Deals for the Halloween Spooktacular Hayride.\nDo Not waste your time or your money!\nI wish I would have checked this site before I purchased anything from these unorganized Hoosiers
1,"Aside from the fantastic decor and hospitable service that my party of 30 received, I want to give a special shout out to the mac and cheese on this menu.  \n\nI know, I know, it's a steak joint so they obviously provide superb steaks.  But their truffle mac and cheese is like nothing I've ever tasted before- and I am not a mushroom girl.  The truffle flavor is just subtle enough that the addition is truly an enhancement.  It was by far the best mac and cheese I've ever tasted (sorry mom).  And well worth the exhorbitant price that was paid for it."
1,"I am typically a Fili B's girl as opposed to the generic ***berto's fan, but I can compromise since Fili B's are harder to find when you aren't in the EV.  I was really really craving a big ol' steak and egg burrito, and I knew the only way to satisfy that craving would be from one of these places.  We were on our way uptown and we ALWAYS see cars in the Eriberto's drive thru on our way to work, so I figured it had to be one of the better ones.  Oh man it is!  My burrito was more like a steak with egg burrito.  It probably weighed three pounds!  It was absolutely delicious, flavorful, and surprisingly not greasy!  I devoured a whopping half of it before I tapped out and then I ate the rest for breakfast the next morning, and yeah, it actually tastes just as good.  I can't really attest to the quality of the other menu items, but if they are even half as good as my burrito was, then you're in good hands."
0,"I found an LP I was looking for at a very fair price on their website. After paying $15.00 shipping, it took several weeks to receive since they only put $4.22 postage on it to cover the media mail charge. Plus they shipped it 2 weeks after I paid. So they overcharged me $10 for shipping AND dragged their feet in shipping it. I would avoid using them for any type of mail order. Says a lot about their business ethics, or lack thereof."
0,"This review is for the Bank of America Corporation.\n\nI decided a few years ago to open a BofA checking account as a secondary account in case I ever had issues with my Chase account.  Being that it was a secondary account, I did not look at it often.  To my surprise, BofA changed the terms of their accounts and the new terms stated that my account now required a higher minimum balance.  I did not even know about this until I logged in online and saw a string of monthly fees because my account did not meet their new minimum.  Great job BofA.  Even after calling BofA and telling them my issue, they would not budge. It is obviously the company's intention to SCREW it's customers like this."
0,I contacted this business 2 days ago and have not heard back. Lost a customer.
1,Pizza is Always Hot and ready never need to wait! Taste good for the price of $5 pies
0,"This place is very hit or miss. If you come when it's not crowded, you can get good food and good service. If the place is slightly busy, or you are very early or late, they are very unfriendly and act like they are doing you a favor to serve you food. I showed up late a couple times and wished they had just told me I was too late to eat. \n\nThe food is pretty bland and nothing that you couldn't make at home. A pancake with a snickers bar laid in the middle sounds awesome, but they do nothing else special with it. \n\nThe chicken is best but make sure you get it fresh and hot or else it's a bit soggy and sad. \n\nAlso, they tend to be very conservative to the point of mocking people on welfare.... So if morals guide you, let them guide you away from this place..."
0,"I have been here 2 times. Both very disappointing. The first time I went to Su Wu was no long after they opened. Went there for dinner. Fries are really good, the rest of the food in the menu is TERRIBLE. I ordered tacos and I couldn't even eat them because they were disgusting. \n\nThis weekend I went here again because I wanted to give it another try, since maybe the lunch menu would be better. I sat there for 20 minutes and they didn't even bring us the menu. NOTHING. I looked at the waitress a couple times. She looked back at me. But she was too busy talking with some friends on another table. Not coming back here ever again."
1,"I'm bumping this place up to 5 stars because after visiting a bunch of other parks around the city, this is my favorite. First of all, it's the one where my kid always has the most fun. They've got so many different things to keep toddlers occupied and happy. Second, the hill. The hill makes for a great workout if you want to sprint up it a few times. If you want to take it easy, go for a leisurely walk up to the top and bring lunch. At the very top they've got an outlook with several benches and a picnic table. It's one of the best views you'll get of the southwest and you'll be able to see the Strip in the distance."
1,"Probably the best 2nd hand store in the valley aside from My Sisters Closet. Regardless if you are looking for a Halloween costume accessory or just a cheap winter jacket that you surely won't want to pay full price for, this is a great place.  I bought my sons $140 wardrobe for Christmas here. (he picked it out if course).  It was all very clean and even some things were new."
0,Slowest service I've had in a long time and the sushi wasn't anything special. It was over 30 minutes from the time we sat down until the first of 3 rolls showed up at our table...with only 8 total customers in the whole place. Their prices aren't horrible but they're not worth the wait when there are a half dozen better sushi options within a few miles of here.
0,"Customer service here leaves a lot to be desired. Although they will help, it usually done with minimal personality and little to no professionalism."
1,First time going to this jiffy lube location and I had an overall great experience getting an oil change. Sam was a joy to be around and helped answer all of my questions. Definitely coming back the next time I need an oil change.
1,This is an extremely busy Harris Teeter and they still keep it organized and clean. Everyone is extremely nice and helpful. They have a lot of workers always staffed to make sure everything is kept moving smoothly.  They have a huge selection of wine and a wine consultant to help you make a great selection that fits your budget.
1,"For any Vegas tourist, the Las Vegas strip is the main & only attraction, especially when it comes to food.  Justifiably so, the LV strip is one of the Big 4 (New York, Los Angeles, San Francisco, and Vegas) when it comes to cities where respected celebrity chefs must have a restaurant.  But any well-informed foodie would take the $50 cab ride to visit Rosemary's.\n\nLocated in a strip mall, I encourage you to not judge a book by its cover.  Once you enter the restaurant, you may still be looking for extravagant decor, so let me disappoint you now that it is just a simple dining room with a bar.  It is basic but warm and it carries no fancy misdirection from the fantastic experience of the food.\n\nThe restaurant is well-priced, with a 3-course prix-fixe at $55 and a 5-course tasting menu at $75.  If you are lucky enough to be part of the fairer sex and come in for Wednesday evening's Ladies Night (half off all food), then it's the foodie deal of a lifetime.\n\nThe quality of the service belongs to a restaurant that should charge much more.  All waiters and servers are attentive, helpful, and knowledgeable.  There is never a messy crumb-filled table top or an unfolded napkin while a patron visits the restroom.\n\nWhether you order just a dish or the prix-fixe, the meal begins with an amuse bouche, a bite-sized appetizer that is the chef's greeting to you.  Then a bread basket comes with a few choices of carbohydrates worth every calorie.  My favorite has been the sweet potato dinner roll, a buttery soft-baked delight with a hint of sweetness.\n\nAt the risk of upsetting animal rights activists, I confess my love for the pan-fried milk-fed veal sweetbread.  For those of you thinking this is more grains, sweetbread is the culinary name for the thymus and the pancreas.  It sounds cruel and disgusting; but it only deserves the first description, because Rosemary's sweetbread is rich, flavorful, and meaty.  If you are a meat-eater, try it at least once.\n\nFor the entree, though you will probably love the rib-eye or pork chop.  I urge you to try the crispy-skinned striped bass served with andouille sausage, rock shrimp, fingerling potatoes, hushpuppies and Creole sauce.  It is New Orleans on a dish, the Big Easy served for you right here in Sin City.\n\nTheir wine-pairing is notable and should be included if you love wine.  But they also offer a rare beer-pairing, each unique beer a perfect compliment for each dish: an experience to be had if you are a beer-drinker.  \n\nAmidst the Thomas Kellers and the Michael Minas of Las Vegas, there are Michael and Wendy Jordan of Rosemary's, pleasantly surprising us with a real and solid dining experience beyond a city that deals in hype."
1,"Martini Ranch has a live band downstairs and a DJ upstairs. We were there once during our Valentine's Day Bar crawl, and the second time during our 80's Bar crawl. \n\nRock Lobster rawked the stage during our 80's crawl. I was dressed like Peg Bundy in my leopard print top with belted waist. I played \""cougar\"" all night, dancing with lots of young, cute guys.\n\nThere's a large outdoor patio for the smokers and those who want to catch some fresh air. I loved the roominess of Martini Ranch. \n\nI will definitely return, especially when Rock Lobster is playing."
1,I have been working with the folks at Countertop Creations. They are awesome and do a wonderful job. I think the negative reviews are just a couple of bad situations. These guys are great.
1,Love the food and the coffee here.  Everything always tastes terrific no matter what I order.  Most of the staff is awesome and provide great service an help each other out with a smile on their face. They have a great patio for outside dinning also.
0,The service was abominable.   Didn't have what I ordered and didn't reimburse my credit card.  Food was aweful.  Don't fall for the picture menu. Doesnt look anything like the pictures hinted.  I hardly give any reviews but felt compelled to do so for this horrible establishment.  You have been warned. Avoid at any cost
0,"FINALLY, a place for hipster wannabes from Assfucklandia to circle jerk!!!  It's ABOUT FUCKING TIME I was able to overspend for a drink and mingle with douchenozzles in ascots and Morrissey glasses...what took you so long, downtown Vegas?! Is there any way I can get a punchcard -- mortgage your house 10 times to buy drinks, get one percentage point free? Where do I sign up?????\n\nI'm on the fence about all this downtown boosterism, but on the whole, progress is good... so I went in to support the new local bar. Sure, it SCREAMS douchetown from the outside...but I did go in with an open mind, I swear.\n\nI bit my tongue while navigating the thug mooks manning the velvet rope out front (!). I bit it again when I shelled out $10 for a drink that costs 1/3 that right across the street. But after hanging out at this place for 3 hours, I ain't biting it no more.\n\nSo many annoying things about this place. There are these weird sort of security-types loitering around inside who can't/won't answer your simplest questions. The whole fuckin' reason I went here was to check out the upstairs patio, but it was closed. Why? No one knew. I wanted to order one of the hot drinks that are labeled \""upstairs\"" drinks, so wanted to know if they were available though the patio is closed. No one knew. Finally found out from the waitress that they were NOT available, so ordered one of their corny specialty drinks...and it was served incomplete, without the special garnish that is an INTEGRAL PART of the drink. If you're gonna charge exorbitant prices for \""mixology\"" drinks, at least make 'em right!! \n\nThe other annoying aspect is the music -- it's so LOUD! My vocal chords were seriously strained after spending a couple hours here, trying to chat with my date. And that was before the DJ even started up!\n\nSpeaking of the DJ, he was the only cool thing about this joint. I expected a douchey hipster type, but he turned out to be an awesomely frumpy older dude with a beer gut, Coke-bottle glasses and stringy, balding hair. He looked more like a children's party clown/secret child molester than your average DJ, and for that I give him MAJOR props.\n\nI actually do genuinely love this bar.......because it keeps all the pretentious assholes in one place, so I don't have to deal with them elsewhere on Fremont St.  So enjoy that $10 jizz fizz, asswad -- I'll be across the street. I'd rather drink among degenerate bluehairs in a smoke-filled casino bar ANY DAY! Hell, I'd rather drink Thunderbird out of a paper bag in the old Ambassador parking lot with that Santa Claus wino....GUARANTEED to be more fun than shouting til your vocal chords are raw with the stuck-up asswads in Commonwealth!"
0,"Star Rating: 2.5 because it is between \""Meh. I've experienced better\"" and \""A-Ok\""\n\nLong Winded Experience: I have been patronizing this establishment since I was in High School over ten years ago. Our favorite pizza of choice is the Buffalo Chicken Pizza. It's extremely delicious, but over the last ten years we have experienced lack-luster presentation and portions from Beach Pizza with this pizza specifically. They treat the chicken pieces like precious metals, sprinkling just a few bits here and there to add \""sparkle\"" to what can only be called a Ranch/Cheese pizza, not a Buffalo Chicken Pizza. We've even asked, every time since the 2nd or 3rd time ordering it, for *extra* chicken. They go ahead and charge us $5 for extra chicken, but the pizza looks just like if you order it without extra chicken. It's completely disappointing and frustrating. The pizza is very delicious and a unique specialty pie, but is it worth $25 for an 18\"" pizza that only has a smattering of Buffalo Chicken on it? I think not. Sorry, Beach Pizza. You have a wonderful concept, and a talented team to pull it off, but you skimp on toppings that make the pizza. My friends and I have eaten our last of Beach Pizza. \n\nTL;DR: Delicious Specialty Pizza, but lacks sufficient \""Bang-for-your-buck\"" in the toppings department for the price and \""Extra toppings\"" vanish into thin air as you pay for them."
1,"I must say that Sears has impressed me over the last couple of weeks.  I ordered an electric mower online to pick up in store and the process was so easy, plus I got 4% cash back for going through http://www.ebates.com/rf.do?referrerid=D%2BzVWKmRzUJI8C90ZWeLZA%3D%3D  They emailed me to confirm the order was ready in minutes.  I printed the email, borught it to the store, scanned the bar code at the kiosk, and the employee brought the mower out within 2 minutes.  If they don't bring your order out in 5 minutes, they will give you a $5 off coupon.  The employee also brought it to my car and put it in my trunk.\n\nA few days later, I saw that the price had dropped by $16.  Sears has a 14 day price match guarantee, including their own stores, so I filled out their quick online form.  The next day I received an email stating they were refunding my credit card for $16!  \n\nThough this store carries more and is a little more organized than the Rock Hill store, I also had a good experience there yesterday, so a review for them is soon to come."
1,As good as it gets. If you want REAL fish and chips this is the only place in the Valley that will get the job done. It was like being back in England ... First Class Sir!
0,"I'd say sub-par / three stars would've been generous - the meat tasted good... But in pretty sure that it made me sick about 30mins later. The tacos were soggy / and there was excessive amounts of fat in the meat. \n\nThe service was mediocre, I guess you can't expect too much from an airport stop / but, this wasn't somewhere I'd choose again.\n\nPerhaps find somewhere with more standard food, if you have a sensitive stomach."
0,"Jason and I used to go to this place for their.. ahem. Bacon Donuts. Yup, I said it. Delicious chocolate or maple frosted raised donuts with either a whole strip or crumbled bacon pieces on it. They were heavenly. Equally as heavenly was the apple filled donuts they had the first time we came around. The service on our first visit was phenomenal, the girl at the counter was super helpful and not at all annoyed when we asked for a minute to look through the selections or asked questions.\n\nWhat the hell happened since then? The 2 times we've been back, no matter how early we seemed to get there (I think most donut places should have all offerings at 8-9am still) there are NO bacon donuts, and NO apple filled donuts. When we ask about them, all we get is this nasty attitude from the girls at the counter since. Like I should know better to ask about the apple filled when behind the sign that says \""apple filled\"" has jelly donuts. Ugh!\n\nAnyway, I doubt we'd be back. We were thinking the service the second time was a fluke. Our mistake, clearly the good service we had the first time around and their bacon and apple filled donuts are all fluke occurrances."
1,So YUMMY!!!!! The bruschetta is excellent . And the services is awesome!! We love to stop here after a movie to chat and get a drink.
1,"I visited this place the weekend after the initial opening, but wasn't too impressed, but after staying there, my opinion of this place has changed.\n\nFirst of all, this is the new addition to the Venetian and I absolutely think the Venetian is one of my favorite places to stay whenever I'm in Vegas.  Palazzo and Venetian are connected so you get best of both.  Shoppes, food, Poker room, decor and friendly service.  \n\nThey have plenty of tables for other games but my favorites are simple Poker and Craps and just tried a new game that will probably be on my list 3 card poker.\n\n\n\nThe rate we got wasn't too bad, $229/night with $25 slot credit, coupons to the spa and entry into the 40/40 club, even though we didn't go.  So overall good value especially when you share the room and there's definitely enough room in the suite to share."
1,Amy is such a great hair stylist. Love the way she does color and extensions are flawless if you are ready to go long give her a call. I have enjoyed Amy's hair care for 7 \nor 8 years. She is Amazing!!!
0,Food was decent.  Don't expect service.  Got a huge frown and attitude when I had the audacity to ask the server to bring me chop sticks.   She brought me a spoon to eat my meal with and nothing else. What?
0,"I dislike this place, first and last time I come here.  It's sad seeing people standing around talking and on their cell phones.  Placed my order and when I got my burger, it was all wrong. I waited an extra 25 minutes for my fixed burger. Not cool. Never again."
1,"I went to another branch of this chain, but it's similar, I'm sure.  I really enjoyed the pizza I had--the pear and gorgonzola--and the waitress was attentive.  I think I drank 5 gallons of water.  The food came out pretty quickly, and it was an overall pleasant experience."
0,"The food was very good and it's a cool building, but the service was terrible.  The hostess was not at all friendly and we were seated at a very uncomfortable high top table and got some attitude when we asked to move.  There was hardly anyone in there, so there were plenty of regular tables.  The server didn't even ask if we wanted refills or dessert, just slapped the bill on the table.  I actually was going to get both, but fine I won't spend any more money there."
0,"If I could give this place 0 stars I would. I waited over an hour to get my fill. They said it would be \""just a few minutes\"". I would have just left but they put my friends feet in the water for her pedicure so we were trapped. She was in the water 30 minutes before they came to her. I also watched them give a full face wax to a woman. They didn't take her in the back room or anything. Just did it right there in front of everyone."
0,"I am a sucker for a book's cover. It looked so cute from the outside. All polished red brick and shiny stone floor. \n\nThe menu looked yummy---I should have ate the menu. The service was bad and rude. Food, cold, bland and not what we ordered. \n\nTo top off a perfectly bad meal---there was a photographer taking our picture. I asked who he was but could not get an answer. Not sure if he was a private eye, paparazzo, or just a freak. \n\nMy suggestion to you is NEVER go there."
0,"There's an Osha Thai back home in SF that is really good and I've heard great raves about this place from my co-workers who claim to be \""thai food snobs\"". Took my sister here and we love thai food and are relatively easy to please at restaurants as well as pretty patient. This place just reopened today after closing for a quick remodel, so maybe being closed for a couple of weeks has made them forget how to give good customer service. \n\nThere were two other guests that came in, who were obviously regulars,  and despite ordering after us by at least 5 minutes, they got their food about 20 minutes before us! Actually I stand corrected, they finished their food before we even got started on our appetizers! We ordered crispy tofu, shrimp pad thai, and fried tofu pad see ew.  The crispy tofu took about 20 minutes to come out, then after that, we waited at least another 20 minutes before being told our food would be out soon. Two people had come in during that time and placed togo orders, to which they got to pick up and leave by the time we got close to getting our food. \n\nThen the food came out and all we could smell was something burning. The pad thai looked and tasted pretty great, but my pad see ew was burned and there were pieces of charred tofu and rice noodles, which were conveniently buried under the pile of broccoli. I tried to be a good sport and eat it, but it was way too bitter. Then they asked how our food was and I said it tasted burnt. The waitress had the audacity to tell me \""that's how it's supposed to be, but I can tell the kitchen to make you another\"". Yeah right, and wait another half an hour? Maybe it took too long bc they forgot and burned my noodles. What happened to customer service where if a customer feels like she tastes charred food, they just apologize for it? Hey, I know carcinogens when I taste it and that was definitely not the brown sauce I expected. \n\nThey ended up taking the pad see ew off my bill, which was the least they could do. I think I ate maybe 1/5 of my meal. The crispy tofu was very good, and so was the pad thai. The pad see ew was not good, so either I shouldn't order it next time, or if I want something charred, that's what I should get. Customer service was SLOW as molasses. There were only 3 other tables there besides us, so I don't see how it took so long to get our food. If you're down for 50% satisfaction, this seems like the place to go. I might try to give them the benefit of the doubt and come back but order something else and getting it to go (call in ahead first!). Otherwise, I'd try to look for some other thai place elsewhere, even though this is down the street from where I live."
0,"Pho Kinh do...if not for the name, we probably never would have walked into this place.  After having eaten there, I must say that the name is probably the best part about the restaurant.  I love pho for the soup - I like my broth meaty, rich, textured, and so flavorful that you can burp it up hours afterwards and still taste it.  The soup here tastes like someone cracked open a can of beef broth (the kind that's on sale at the supermarket for 55 cents), heated it up slightly, and then dunked some noodles in there.  The soup was lukewarm, and tasted like msg water.  Ironically, even though the soup was not hot, the beef was already fully cooked (if not overcooked) when it came out - it was chewy and tasted like it had been cooked hours ago.  The summer rolls were cheaper than some of the other places we've tried in vegas, but they weren't anything special - the skin on the ends was hard and uncooked on one of my rolls.  As a side note, their banh mi looked interesting (lots of different combinations, including some with egg!) and might be worth a try.\n\nAs for service...we sat down and were not handed menus.  I eventually ended up grabbing the menus myself after unsuccessfully trying to flag down a waitress.  It also took awhile to order, and the food came fast, but that's probably because they hardly heated up the soup at all.  The one thing I will say is that once we finally got our menus and placed our orders, the waitress was very friendly and had a good attitude.  That being said, I don't really care if I have to serve myself at a pho place as long as the broth is slurpy delicious.  \n\nTo summarize: don't come here to eat the pho soup.  It is not anything dac biet."
0,"Went in the other day and it was my first time hearing that they were a private bar. I've been here about 5 other times through the year. I didn't want to sign any forms for membership that night, I just wasn't in the mood. As I was leaving the staff was kind enough to insult me with saying what kind of a person was I that I couldn't afford the membership. Well with attitude like that I won't ever consider spending my money here again. If the owners let the staff get away with this level of service then I suspect everything else is being neglected. I suggest you visit another bar before considering this place. There's plenty other spots with a lot friendlier staff in Charlotte."
1,"Restaurant Week has really proven its worth and shown me two great restaurants that I probably would have never experienced before.\n\nI almost want to keep this place to myself, but I have to talk about it because it really was that good!\n\nMarssa is located in the Loews Las Vegas Resort which is further out than the MonteLago Village of Lake Las Vegas.  We thought we had missed the hotel since we were driving along for awhile.\n\nLoews Las Vegas is a hidden gem of a resort and I'm glad we found ourselves there.  \n\nTheir Restaurant Week menu offered you a choice among two starters, two entrees, and two desserts.  Luckily, the Big F and I agree on one really important thing, and that's food.  We easily decided to try the whole menu.  Just as we were about to put in our order, our waiter came by and told us they were out of hamachi.  That definitely put a damper on things and we looked over what we could substitute with hamachi.  As we perused over all the different rolls and sushi, the waiter came back and said they found more!  Yay!  \n\nService continued being a little quirky when steak knives soon appeared and an entr\u00e9e consisting of beef arrived in front of me.  When a second steak showed up in front of the Big F, we knew something was wrong.  We motioned to a waiter (not our original one), and told him we didn't think these were our entrees.  Our waiter swiftly took them away (as they were $100 pieces of steak)!  Then the Big F noticed some discussion going on at a nearby table and had a feeling that they received our starters.  Indeed, that is what happened!  All was sorted out and we finally got our meal! \n\nStarters, choice of:\n\n* Sashimi Trio \""cajun seared albacore, garlic ponzu sauce; togarashi seared tuna yuzu miso sauce; and yellowtail asian pico del gallo\"" - Two pieces of sashimi each and what makes this fish different is their unique and complementing sauces.  They had us scooping up all the sauce we could!\n\nor\n\n* Sushi Sampler \""4 pieces hamachi verde: (yellowtail, scallions, Thai chilis topped with cilantro, and thinly sliced limes) and 2 pieces temari scallop (slices of tuna around spicy sea scallops with wasabi flying fish roe and wasabi aioli).\"" - The hamachi verde is a refreshing sushi roll with the lime slices, but it's the temari scallop roll that was the real winner.  We really enjoyed the scallop and wasabi aioli, it had us wanting more!\n\nEntrees, choice of:\n\n* Miso Braised Kobe Short Rib \""shiitake mushrooms, grilled asparagus, crisp maui onions\"" - One of their most popular dishes, and you can easily see why.  The morsels of meat were gently braised and quite delicious.  The buttery mashed potatoes were just fattening and oh-so good!  A heavy dish indeed!\n\nor \n\n* Opakapaka Lau Lau \""coconut ginger cream, kobocha squash and banana chutney.\"" - Beautifully presented where they 'release' the banana leaves to showcase the hidden secrets that lay within.  I'm not one for cooked fish, but this was extraordinary.  Not dry at all, and the sweetness from the banana chutney adds a completely new dimension to it.  I would go back and order this again for sure!\n\nDesserts, choice of:\n\n* Chocolate Lava Cake - A molten center with lovely sauces and fresh berries that come with it.\n\n or \n\n*Asian Pear Tart - Oh my gawd delicious.  So good that it's not worth sharing.  The tart is flaky and light, and the asian pears are sweet and just perfect.  And the sauces that come with it only add to the happy hum in your mouth.  Worth driving out this way just for a slice of heaven.  It's definitely one of my favorite desserts ever.  You probably saw me licking the plate!\n\nOur waiter forgot that we ordered the sake flight, a sampling of four sakes ($19).  And when we told him midway through our meal that he could just forget about it, he decided instead to give it to us complimentary!  The four samples included \""shirakaberuga junmai, dewazakura \""oka\"", hoyo \""fair maiden\"", and creme de sake.\""  \n\nWe did notice that it was hard to find our waiter and it looked understaffed.  When we had a chance to chat with the waiter later on, he did confirm that it was understaffed that night, which definitely explains the mix-up with all the food.\n\nDespite all the weird service, I'd give Marssa a 4.5.  (I'm sure it would be a solid 5 during our return visit.  We're told we have to try their Dinner for Two Sushi Platters created by Master Sushi Chef Osama \""Fuji\"" Fujita!)  Master Fuji was actually on hand when we left so we got to say hi too!  With him being the ONLY master sushi chef in Nevada, how can you resist not sitting in front of him?\n\nBut if we don't go for sushi, I'd definitely return for their other entrees instead.  This is one of my top choices for a nice date restaurant!\n\n(And you know pics are posted of this fabulous dinner!)\n\nUpdate! 12/08 - Returned for another fabulous visit.  This time we sat at the sushi bar and enjoyed wonderful food and fabulous service."
0,"I probably won't return. I've been noticing these chains popping up all over the Dane County area and decided to stop by for lunch with a co worker while I was in Sun Prairie.\n\nWhat I like is that as soon as you walk in, you're greeted by someone who helped you with the process if you're a first timer. This is very different from other sandwich places. You go up to a station where all of their sandwiches are written in bags. So if you want a turkey sandwich, you crab the brown paper bag that has written in the back all of the turkey options they have. They do the same for beef, tuna, veggie, chicken, etc. You grab the bag of the sandwich you want and on the bag, you mark with a provided sharpie all of the toppings you want. This is a really neat idea. I liked the selection process. When you've marked your bag with all of your toppings, which they do provided a lot of choices I must admit, you take the bag to the register to pay and the bag is sent to sandwich artist. They put the finished sandwich in the same bag with your selections. Again, very cool idea. When're sandwich is done, they call you by name. There is a place on the bag for you to put your name down. \n\n\nHowever, they are overpriced for their quality of food. You get to pick from three different bread sizes, 6, 10.5 and 14 inches. For a 10.5 inch, it's $8.25 if you don't add toppings that are priced extra.   The sandwich was just OK. Nothing special. They gave me the wrong mustard but it wasn't a huge deal. My biggest issue is that there isn't any combo special. At least that is not what was told to me. For a 10.5 inch sandwich with not extra priced toppings and a small bag of chips, it was over $10. Had I added a pop, I would have been close to $12. It's a lot of money for a sandwich that's very basic and some chips. If the sandwiches were gourmet or other products were locally made, I totally could see the justification of price. However, the sandwich was just basic.  I prefer Quiznos or Pot Bellys over Which Wich to be honest. I had a lot of toppings on mines, but my sandwich was overwhelmed with mayor and horseradish. I couldn't even taste the other toppings. \n\nDoubtful i'd return. They aren't  terribly bad but they are far from greatness. The experience of picking your sandwich is cool but that's really the only positive I have from my first time experience. I can at least day I tried it and seen what they had to offer. Now I know and I won't be returning. I've had better sandwiches elsewhere."
0,"20 bucks to get in and the crowd was scarier than the Mix on a Sunday afternoon. Sorry Vegas, this place is the worst..."
0,"Very disappointing stay.  After a very slow and sloppy check-in process (e.g., she wrote my rate in the key sleeve rather than my room number) I went to my room where I discovered they were assigning me a \""roommate\"".  In other words, the room they gave me was still occupied and someone was actually in the room.  So I had to go back to the front desk for a new room.  When I told her what happened she asked \""are you sure\""...?  Room itself was fine.  However, the bathroom had a smell that immediately brought me back to the boys locker room in high school...a smell I never thought I would be exposed to again.\nBreakfast this morning was another folly.  The restaurant posted it opens at 6:30 am.  At that time there were 7-8 hotel guests circling like vultures waiting to be seated.  The hostess would not seat us until she counted her bank and got her station ready.  So we waited 10 minutes for her to count her pennies...\n\nManagement needs to look in the mirror and get their act together."
0,"Worst service EVER!!  We had a party of 6 and made a reservation for 7:45. The restaurant asked us to push it back to 8:15. We weren't thrilled about that, but figured it wasn't a huge deal, we were not seated until 9pm. When we asked why such a long wait, they said they were overbooked, sorry but isn't that why you take a reservation? The wait staff was then slow and we didn't get out of there til after 11pm. I'll never go back."
1,"OK, I usually like to stop at local restaurants to enjoy their local approach to food, and there is an In-N-Out just a half mile from my home in California.  But the rest of the people in the car wanted In-N-Out, and I wasn't driving.\n\nBut, the taste and quality was just like home.  I got the cheeseburger, animal-style. (And if you don't know what that means, ask somebody who works there.  Or eats there often.)  And a shake.  In-N-Out still makes the best burger anywhere, whether it is in Nevada, Arizona or California.\n\nThis location has a merchandise store next door where you can buy all kinds of In-N-Out T-shirts, hats, etc., etc. \n \nMaybe next time I'll order a vanilla shake and a small drink, get some root beer and make my own root beer float.  Mmmmm.  I'm getting hungry just thinking about it.  Animal-style fries, too."
1,"OMG stop what you're doing and try this place out.....now!!!  Well actually, maybe not, there's a huge line and you'll most likely be waiting for two hours.  \n\nIt's literally a bar, and they only seat 18, so be prepared to do your due diligence and stand in line.  Or you can have an awesome friend stand in line for the group while you grab a drink, play some slots or blackjack until you're seated.  TRUST ME, it's worth the wait!!!  And that's coming from someone who NEVER waits in line for food.  \n\nYou really don't come here for the oysters, you come here for the combo pan roast.  Don't get me wrong, the dozen oysters we ordered were fresh and on point (from Louisiana I think...), but there's plenty of other places to get fresh oysters.  I wasn't too crazy about the mussels but it was worth a try.\n\nThe chef cooks directly in front of where you're seated, so you get a bird's eye view of the action.  I noticed many of the guests are regulars, so they must know how amazing the food is here.\n\nThe combo pan roast...bomb diggity!  I only got it level 6 spiciness (probably could have gone with a level 8), but WOW, I was blown away!!  Creamy, spicy, tons of flavor mixed with shrimp, crab, and lobster!  The portions are huge, and I promise you will be extremely satisfied afterwards.\n\nIt's a shame they have such a small seating area and they don't take orders to go; if you are ordering to go, you have to stand in line anyways, so I guess it makes sense.  But goodness, expand this place would ya!!\n\nWhenever I'm in Vegas again, this will definitely be on my top places to visit.  Good thing they're open 24/7!"
1,"While in Vegas, we stayed at Harrah's.  Although it is not the most luxurious, it is the most gregarious site.  People come by,  shop, gamble, eat and sing at the Karaoke lounge.  The pool is beautiful and refreshing.  Lounge chairs abound.  There is always something going on and I very highly recommend it."
0,"Worlds Worst Frijoles. I ordered a small side of rice and beans for my toddler. How can you mess that up? The beans came out looking like soupy sewage mess, plus tasted funky. The rice resembled something from a frozen package. Truly disgusting. My burrito was the same quality. I returned the food, paid for my drink, and left to find some good Mexican! Manager also didn't acknowledge the situation at all. When I approached him he just stared at me and said nothing."
0,"Horrible service and bland, tasteless food!"
0,"The menu apparently shrunk. My chicken fried chicken was not as good as I remembered it to be during prior visits in Tulsa, OK. ...Frosty mugs were great. Service was good."
0,"Let me start off by saying I LOVE this place. But a recent bad experience left a bitter taste in my mouth. Went on 8/17, and was told they had a limited menu based on \""kitchen problems.\"" OK, no big deal. As long as there is cheese and beer, I'm good. My date and I wanted to linger and order several courses and beers, but when we ordered, we were forced to order all of our food at once. While we stressed several times that we wanted everything to come separately so we could enjoy the food and beer at our own pace, all of our food came at once, and very shortly after we ordered. Uncool. A table full of cheese, frites, and burgers, getting cold before we could get to it all; not the leisurely dining experience we wanted at all. When we complained, we were told that the dishwasher was broken and they were trying to push food out as quickly as possible. What?? So basically you're telling me you're purposely trying to push customers out the door as quickly as possible? If I wanted fast food, I would've gone to McDonald's. To make matters worse, our waitress immediately took our beer menu away; guess I'm not having another drink? And even though we complained, nothing was done to make it right--nothing comped, no discount, and frankly, a very insincere apology. WTF? Brasserie V?! If \""kitchen issues\"" kept you from providing the quality dining experience I've come to expect from your establishment, you should not have opened."
1,I ve been living here for a year and have faced no problems at all. The apartments on the penthouse floor which is the 22nd floor are great. You have an option of choosing an apt with new appliances which are much better than the really old ones. The maintainence staff and the office are always available and helpful. I did have some problems with the dishwasher and the kitchen sink but it was fixed.
1,"Amazing ox tail stew, this alone made my day. Great variety, comfort Chinese food, good portions, acceptable service, it's my new favorite budget go-to Chinese restaurant."
0,"Even though the restaurant was empty, they hostess let us know that the only tables available were the outdoor tables by the waterfall.  They had a minimum of $150 pp, so we figured we might as well splurge on a meal and get the tasting menu.\n\nThe service was great, as were the drinks.  The food definitely did not meet my expectations.  Perhaps the fish in Houston is fresher, but the food at Mizumi just didn't do it for me.  \n\nThey asked if we had any food allergies, and I told them I was allergic to peanuts.  Since I couldn't have the dessert that was part of the tasting menu, they brought out sorbet for me (and charged me for it!!)."
0,was this one of many casinos that didn't offer asian gaming opportunities? i forget. so many didn't. it didn't matter.
1,"I have a couple meetings in Montreal tomorrow so flew in this morning.\n\nI didn't feel like going too far for supper so went to B\u00e2ton Rouge, which was nearby.\n\nI ordered one of my favourite meals at B\u00e2ton Rouge ... Chicken Tenders.  I got them with garlic mashed potatoes (there was also bacon in them).  As usual, they were delicious!\n\nI felt like having something sweet so ordered the Decadent Chocolate Walnut Brownie.  It was okay ... very very sweet.\n\nBrigitte was my server and she took excellent care of me."
1,I was nervous about buying ammo for my first time alone and being a woman in a gun shop can be a bit frightening. These guys were so helpful and nice that it was a positive experience after all. Nick (?) was very informative about pricing and which were better options and William was fun to talk to while he rang up my items. I don't know a whole lot about guns but I still feel comfortable coming in here when I need something. Definitely recommended.
0,"When my coworker told me dollar shots and two dollar Corona's, I was down. Little did I know about the Western Casino other than it was two blocks down from Fremont Street.\n\nOh Jesus. Gird your loins. It was all mixed emotions when it came to the Western. Yay for cheap liquor! Boo for the patrons who also enjoy cheap liquor! This place definitely exemplifies 'Dark Vegas' - sketchy patrons, dim lighting, dive, dive, DIVE. The bartenders were great! Cracking jokes, cordial, attentive despite being busy. However, the other patrons were ridiculous. I definitely do not suggest coming alone, let alone a group of less than four. \n\nMy party was comprised of nine people, yet that did not excuse us from cat calls from creepy gentlemen or derogatory names from questionable women. But for dollar shots (Smirnoff, Jack Daniel's, Jose Cuervo Gold, Southern Comfort), two dollar Coronas, and dollar Coors Light, I can't complain. We left sufficiently boozed, with new friends, yet I doubt any of us would return. It's safe to say that the nine of us are scarred from venturing that far past Fremont."
0,I work in the area so have eaten at this location numerous times.\n\nThe location is right across from the Mandalay Bay.\n\nThe staff at this location changes constantly. But no matter how often the staff changes you can always count on them being inept. \n\nIf you have to eat here I'd suggest walking inside. The drive through is always a long wait.\n\nThe food is typical McDonalds except for their french fries. At most McDonalds I love their fries...not at this place. They're always old and it taste as if they never change the oil in their fryer.  I've never had a good french fry at this place.\n\nIf you're really craving McDonalds I'd suggest you try another one.
1,The Chicken and Waffles really hit the spot.  A great place to go to with generous portions and plenty of coffee.  The service was pretty good too.
1,"Chloe's is one of the best new restaurants to hit downtown! I've visited several times for lunch and cannot say enough good things about Chloe's. They are just consistently good. And, the nice thing about this restaurant is they are great for a quick grab-and-go as well as a leisurely lunch.\n\nThe salad bar has veggies and extras that have always been nice and fresh...nothing that looked like it was sitting out for too long. The sandwich menu has a great variety. I've had the chipotle-raspberry turkey sandwich. It had just the right amount of spice and spread. Also, the ciabatta roll it was served on was not too hard as ciabattas can be sometimes.\n\nAs far as desserts, they have a wonderful selection of those too. I've had the chocolate snickerdoodle and triple chocolate chip cookies. The chocolate snickerdoodle is something I've never seen before and is so much more delicious than the traditional snickerdoodle. The triple chocolate chip was not lacking in chips. It was just the right texture as well...not dry, but a firm cookie with a good chew to it.\n\nI really can't praise Chloe's enough...it is certainly worth trying and going back over and over again!"
0,"The food at Pizzeria Bianco was okay, but I was actually thoroughly disappointed in my experience. It may have been that it had been built up for me for a long time, but the wait was long, the food wasn't the greatest, and the place itself was a bit cramped.\n\n1. Wait-time: Before I actually had my first dining experience there, I had tried 4 times previously to eat at Pizzeria Bianco. They don't take reservations, and the line is always out the door (or at least with 4-5 other groups ahead of you). On the day I actually had enough time to wait, I waited around 30 minutes to get seated, and another 10 or so for a waiter, and another 20 after that for the food to come out, for about an hour of total waiting time. \n**One good thing about the wait was that they had another building for you to sit and order appetizers/drinks if you wanted before you got seated.\n\n2. Food: I don't quite understand the hype of this pizza. The crust was burnt and the toppings were not the best either- I tried three types of pizza, sharing it with the friends I was with, but honestly, none of them struck me as absolutely amazing. \n\n3. Small room: I would estimate that there are about 8 tables at the place. Even after waiting for so long, we were stuck at the farthest corner of the restaurant by the restroom, and even that table was severely cramped. One of my friends was squished into the corner while another was awkwardly eating off of a side. \n\nI don't regret this experience at all- I have to say it was worth trying, just because it was rated the \""Best Pizza in the US\"" by various celebrity/food critic sources. I just personally wouldn't claim it as the best pizza I've ever had."
0,"nothing to rave about this place.\nservice was poor and the food was bad.\nI know, I shouldn't expect much on cajun food in phoenix. but I'm always up for an adventure."
0,"The biodome is not a zoo, and it's not quite a botanical gardens.\n\nWe came this past weekend and found the longest line I have ever seen in my life. There were people everywhere. The line went all the way around the biodome, to the theater, then back again. We had paid for a taxi there, so we had little choice but to wait in line. It moved fast-ish though, I'd say we were outside for about an hour.\n\nOnce we got in I realized why there were so many people there - it was free day. So the good news was that there was no charge, the bad news was that because it was free there were thousands upon thousands of people there. Many more than I am sure is normal.\n\nAntarctic area was closed, so that congested the people even more and it was not at all an enjoyable experience. We were just a body of smelly humanity that surged forward en masse. There was no space or time to enjoy any of the exhibits.\n\nBut what am I going to do? Ask for my money back?"
1,Great place!!! Very quaint atmosphere with that old school ambiance. It was a nice quiet afternoon when we went.\nThe service was very attentive automatically giving samples on winning colored spoons.. Answering questions and being patient too!!!\nWe got a scoop of chocolate with Oreos on top which is perfect serving for a kid! We shared the oreo chocolate concrete... So good he couldn't leave the rest! Smoother and better mix than competition and with all the flavors we will be back.  What can you say but some of the best custard!\nOnly reason not four stars: no low fat options for those who tolerate low fat but not full fat milk so can't go back often.... Could be a good thing though!
0,"I have to admit that I have a love-hate relationship with Lo-Lo's.  The chicken is incredible, the waffles are okay, but the service always drives me nuts!  I'm okay with the sticky menus, the soggy mac and cheese can be overlooked as well, but don't disrespect me or make us wait 30 minutes for a plate of chicken.  \n\nIf you're not in a hurry, you will probably love this place, but be prepared for some southern style mosy-like service.  \n\nHere are some tips worth the read:  the chicken is great, but if you really want to taste some soul food, you've got to get the dark meat and collard greens with waffles.  When you order your drink, you've got to try the Kool-aid.  Yes, I'm serious!\n\nLo-Lo's you've got me all worked up again.  If you could just have some friendly, fast service, I'd be regular and you'd be a bit richer."
0,"Did you change owners or managers? We used to love this place and visited every time that we were in Phoenix. Well known for the very HOT and delicious food, we were very disappointed on our recent visit. The food was not spicy at all, so much for those who like it hot, which is their logo!! One of our guests was even served a large portion of FAT (more than half of the meat in the meal) in their carnitas, you would have thought that the cooks would have seen this and not served it!! Will not be coming back next time."
1,"I found place completely by chance while stumbling around South Side. My luck had never been better. \n\nI was trying to find another clothing store in South side (which we were barred from entering, because apparently, they don't open on Mondays) until I found this vintage store.  Anyway, we started to trudge back to the car when this store happened to catch our eyes. \n\nThe place was impeccably designed with local artists and while they did not have a large selection of clothes, what they did have was impeccable.  Even better - it wasn't crazily overpriced either like a lot of other vintage stores. I would have picked up almost everything in the store if I could have."
1,I love this place!! Great food and service..portions are Hugh..
1,"Very creative menu.  Delicious food for the most part.  Occasionally there have been some weird waitresses in there that act like they are too good to help you, and you are an inconvenience.  I was very put off when I walked in and asked if I could order something to go and was told \""NO\""...seriously WTH? You don't want my money...alrighty then."

1,"I was moved to write a review of Bahn Thai not only because their food is spectacular, but also because their service is excellent.\n\nThis past Sunday my cousin and I tried to go to Bahn Thai, but were disappointed to find them closed. As we were about to leave someone came and opened the door. They were very understanding of our situation and allowed us to eat lunch in the restaurant while it was closed (they were there cooking for a catering event).\n\nThe Pud Thai (pad thai) was some of the best I've had in the entire country. I live in LA, and can't find pad thai this good. \n\n5 star thai restaurant"
0,I usually love Oreganos...but today not so much. They changed the toasted raviolis and the new kind is not good. The service was mediocre only checked on us once in an hour and a half...just disappointed. And Oreganos needs to bring back the Veggie Wedgie.
1,"Really a 4.5 in my eyes, but I will round up to a 5 b/c Trump has badass room service.  \n\nGot a deal through HotWire and paid a decent price for 2 nights (Friday/Saturday).  This hotel is sliiiightly off the strip, but is still directly across a small side street from Fashion Show Mall.  It made it very convenient for us to get breakfast at one of two Starbucks inside the mall.  Mmmm...Also, because of its location, when taxis came to pick us up, the drivers took Industrial Blvd, which was waaaay less crowded than Las Vegas Blvd.  This saved us a lot of time and cab fare!  HOOORAY!\n\nThere is no self-parking lot here, so be ready with some cash to tip the valet people.  They are all very friendly and will signal for a cab for you 24/7.  Trump also has shuttles going to Caesar's Palace and Wynn every day.  I can't recall the hours exactly, but I think for CP, the shuttle service ends at midnight every night.\n\nAll rooms come with a King-sized bed and a Queen-sized couch bed.  There is even a kitchenette and roomy fridge for those who want to make their own meals/snacks.  Be sure to save room for the delicious fries and tiramisu from room service though!  Trust me!  You won't be disappointed.\n\nAll in all, I was quite pleased with this hotel.  I highly recommend it for anyone who wants to stay at a hotel that doesn't have a casino (GASP!)and is 100% non-smoking.  You are charged a little less than $23/day for resort fees, which allows you to use the pool, internet, gym, and a few other ammenities.  So people, use their stuff!!!\n\nOh yes, be sure to lounge around by the family-friendly poolside (nothing fancy, but a good place to relax and cool off).  Free towels, lounge chairs, and umbrellas.  Cabanas can be reserved as well (not sure if it costs anything)."
1,"Absolutely delicious and entertaining, got to see our meal made in front of us, excellent food and service was okay, not great service but okay. Definitely will be coming back!"
1,"Came for their $20 bottomless mimosas during brunch. I also ordered their highly recommended steak salad which was \""potentially\"" good. Sadly, the tough steak took away from enjoying my meal. I had a hard time cutting into the slices and chewing, but the marination and flavor of the steak was good. \n\nI think I drank a good 8 mason jars full of mimosas before I could finally get a good buzz. Which made me wonder if they over pour orange juice in it or the champagne isn't as strong as decent champagne usually is. Then again it is $20 bottomless for a reason. \n\nThe place is super hipster and fun, which I love because it does give you something to look at and enjoy while waiting or sitting around. The backyard is super fun! Think the backyard is all there is? Nay! Follow the wonderfully decadent china wall and to the end you'll find a small opening where the fun teeter-totters are hidden! What fun! We had a ball with that one and any person who says they don't teeter-totter, I guarantee you a few mimosas later you'll be riding that thing like charlie brown!\n\nThe service was very attentive always asking how we are doing and constantly refilling our drinks. Sandy they ran out of mimosas right before we could order one last one before it ended, but high tens to the bartender because she was nice enough to give us one last round of shots to end our happy hour. As you may predict, that awesomely tasteful shot that I cannot name had probably been the beginning of a very downward spiral turn of events for that night. Not so much sad turn of events, but more hangover memorable."
0,"And now we come to Cinco de Mayo. Sadly, there were no events in Montreal. I diligently searched on Google to no avail. So I settled on a snazzy Mexican joint, Lim\u00f2n, in the St. Henri quartier. I met my friend, Philippe, at 5:30 sans reservations - shame on me. Every single table in the place was open but there wasn't anything available until 8:00. Strange. I guess they just reserve the tables the whole night with reserved signs and the party has it for the whole night. So we ended up eating at the bar.\n\nEven the Mexican restaurant didn't have any Cinco de Mayo specials! Although, I guess this is to be expected since it commemorates the Battle of Puebla, which was a victory over the French. I celebrated with a couple of margaritas which weren't of the size or quality that I'm used to, and the place had absolutely no Mexican flare.The enchiladas were so so, although the presentation was very nice. The service was just so so as they could've been more friendly."
0,"Like Chuck E Cheese, only without the fun....kidding actually.\n\nHonestly I was expecting something different before walking in. Something more upscale (nice looking building) something more, um, grown up. What I got was kids running around like mad, birthday parties, team trophy parties (Desert Breeze is right across the street) and mayhem of the kid-like order. But that's cool... Read on.\n\nSo this review is NOT about the atmosphere or the establishment (probably a great place to take the kids) but the food...it really isn't that good. We did the lunch buffet (maybe that was my mistake) salad bar with scant ingredients, 3 kinds of pizza to choose from...guess? You got it: Cheese, pepperoni and veggie...wow! Greasy 'broasted' chicken, and potato wedges, big fat wedges, like the potato was cut into thirds.\n\nEating here makes me miss Shakey's Pizza all that much more."
1,"I enjoyed going to this place with my daughter. Good atmosphere and the staff was friendly. Pick a piece off the shelf, sit down, listen to some good pointers and then paint away. Set aside a couple of hours if you are doing something detailed as you want to get three good coats of color."
1,"I'm going to start off with saying, I think Bike Barn deserves some of the reviews it has gotten here. I've bought 4 bikes from them in the last year, so I have run the gamut on what they have to offer. The guys who helped me with my first three bikes, were approachable relatively friendly but did what no salesman should do. \""It's good for its price range.\"" \n\nREALLY because I thought it was what I could afford.  To be fair Landis cycling said the same thing to me. I guess it's in the bike salesman book on how to win and influence customers............ So yeah, bike guys, stop saying that. It pisses your customers off.  With that off my chest, I can tell you why to go in there. Her name is Mary. She is amazing and has earned my business until she leaves Bike Barn. ASK FOR HER. She knew her inventory, had no problem answering my questions and fitted me for a bike that works for me. I even gave her many options some of them definitely more expensive and yet she persisted in making sure I got the right bike for me. That's impressive in my book. Try not to lose her bike Barn and get her to train the guys, they need something.\n\n PS I shopped a lot of bike places, there prices were comparable if not slightly cheaper than other places. I have no idea why anyone would think this particular store is more expensive.....Maybe to Wal-mart?"
1,"This place is a jewel of the community. Delicious pastries, excellent customer service, and yummy drinks make this spot for at least 5 years now. The staff is friendly and the prices are reasonable. Highly recommended!"
0,"Don't go here if you want quick service, an attentive waitstaff, a \""special\"" request like rice noodles instead of rice, or good food. Perfect for college kids."
0,"Overrated!  My boyfriend and I went to Vegas for my birthday over Memorial day weekend. Saturday  we decided to go to Tao nightclub.  We arrived at the Venetian and were ushered into one of two huge lines, (a  guest list line and a regular line) like cattle, well, decked out scantily clad anorexic cattle.  After slowly moving to the front of the line which wrapped around the building, we were not found to be on the guest list and had to pay the 40$ for guys and 20$ for girls cover!   You can get on the guest list ahead of time by visiting the web site well before arriving.   Then we are ushered into a maze of dark hallways (still packed in herd formation) but now we are inside and you could start to tell there was little ventilation and experience  'second hand breath'.   \n\nWe stopped at one of the first dance floors and wanted to try to find a place to sit .  I asked one of the security/ushers and I got a - HA! Good luck, I guess you can try to sit in the tables until the VIP's who reserved them arrive.   I didn't realize this was a privilege to sit.   I have only come to Vegas on non weekends before so being a Saturday night on Memorial Day weekend was a completely different experience.   \n\nSo we decide to get a drink.  The 'line' to get a drink was like a bee hive pack of people several layers deep which you had to just keep pushing your way to the front as each  club goer emerged with their drink.  I decided to get something simple since it seemed there was no muddling going on for my picky taste in martinis.  I got the feeling if I had asked for a lemon drop I would have had a 'soup Nazi' response of NO MARTINI FOR YOU. The bartenders seemed to want to get you out of there as fast as possible.  I ordered a vodka cranberry and my boyfriend his Jack and Coke. I figured my 20$ would cover two single well drinks.  Not!   It was 32$ for a small bucket type glass.  Paid my tab and tried to protect my precious cargo as I made my way out of the bar line/swarm.  \n\nWe walked over to the dance floor and it was just packed and I was getting overwhelmed with the recycled breath and asked where is it less crowded.  Thankfully someone told us to make our way up to Tao Beach.  As we ascended the stairs, which were like office building type stairwells surrounded by red painted walls with an occasional photo or directional sign on them, we could start to sense the fresh air ahead.   After several flights of stairs we finally made it to the rooftop open air Beach.  It was a totally different atmosphere!   Very open and airy, lots colorful lights and VIP cabanas lined the perimeter.  There were very few people up there at that point.  It was around 10:00 or so, so we enjoyed having a huge increase in personal space and to move and breathe freely.  We  found a table / wicker couch/bench type thing with a few pillows that was unoccupied in the middle area of the club.  This was a major score as my  boyfriend,  with great fashion sense and taste,  had just got me a  super cute pair of 5\"" gladiator heels - which I decided to wear / break in that evening.  I would have made a different decision on wearing NEW shoes if I knew we needed to get a loan to sit down virtually anywhere we went.  \n\nStill nursing the overpriced well drink, we looked at the menu on the table for the fee for bottle service,  thinking with one shot being 16$ we may be better off with bottle service.   The cheapest fifth of Vodka was 600$ for Skyy I think it was.  We decided to just have one or two drinks here, soak up the atmosphere and drink for real back in our room or somewhere else.  We did enjoy people watching from our comfy albeit temporary spot.  There were no cocktail servers that would come by, there seemed to only be there for the VIP cabanas.  Several cocktail servers, guys dressed in all black and more girls in fishnets and burlesque type outfits,  were parked on the perimeter .  The music was good and we actually got to relax and have fun there. \n\n After about 45 minutes or so we were asked to move as the group of 6 or 7 young guys arrived who had reserved the table.  By now it had become more crowded and twice I was bumped into by a waiter swishing by carelessly trying to rush through the crowd (to the VIP cabana's).  I was pretty irritated to lose 5$ worth of my drink in each elbow bump!  That is when I decided  -  I am going to Yelp this! - and that it was time to go.  \n\nSo based on the amount of people they packed in, lack of fresh air, the overpriced drinks, lack of seating and lack of cocktail servers for regular people, that earns -1 stars.  The Tao Beach atmosphere was the only positive for me.  The fresh air, lots of lights, decent music, and laid back mellow atmosphere earns a couple of stars back.   I still would not want to go back  nor recommend going unless you are a VIP - so, as a regular person,  I ended up with the 1 star rating."
1,The food is very fresh and the energy is always cool. Great atmosphere
0,"We got a clean room in the MGM Signature Grand on the third floor.  That is all we got.  Housekeeping never came even when we asked.  We never got our newspaper.  Getting on the wireless was a pain.  But the room was wayyy cheaper than the MGM Sig Grand.  I think its probably fine for two people (husband and wife who don't make a mess) but I wouldn't bring a whole family or an entourage in their suites.  I prefer places like the MGM Sig Grand where there is no gambling on the ground floor and I found the location uber convenient.  If I had gotten an ounce of real service, I would be giving them one or two more stars."
0,Located outside of town going towards Penicuik. For me this shopping area just doesn't strike my fancy. Feels hard to get around the place without always looking to make sure I don't get hit by a car. The stores are also ones I never or wouldn't normally shop at. The best place here I think is the Pet store. You can go in and browse at the fish and bunnies and such. \nThere's also a Sansburys but I find them to be to expensive as well. Check the place out though before judging it to harshly from Yelp reviews. I just don't care for it to much .
1,Great Japanese restaurant for the area!  The sushi was delicious and the happy hour special of $1.50 off all drinks is nice too!  They overcharged me for the Saki but were very willing and gracious to change it on my bill.  Highly recommend it.
0,"If you are looking for a qwik meal, qt now offers a wrap or sandwich of your choosing along with a bad of chips and a drink for $5. I picked the southwestern chicken wrap. The wrap was cut in half. The first half was delicious. The bread was extremely soft and tasty. The two face 2nd half was drowned in its own wrap juices and completely nasty."
0,"I don't like giving a 1 star rating. I usually reserve that for a really horrible experience but in this case, this place earned a one star rating. I know that is harsh but this place straight up sucked. \n\nThere were 8 of us and when you have a large group it's difficult to coordinate where to go to eat. Someone in the group suggested we check out the Binion and off we went. We stumbled across Benny's and decided to go in since it wasn't busy. \n\nThere is no hostess stand so you walk in and find your own table to sit at, at least I think that's how it works. The middle aged waitress didn't acknowledge us while we were standing at the front. We walked around the small space seeing if there was a table for 8, there was not. There's only tables for 4. One couple was leaving and told us we could have their table to put together with the open table next to theirs. We did that. The waitress came over and did a quick wipe down with a dirty rag that left streaks and food behind. Eeww. I ended up wiping it down with the paper towels that were on the table.\n\nThe menu consists of 4 things. Full rack or half rack of ribs, 1/2 roasted chicken or 1/2 roasted chicken with 1/2 rack of ribs. Prices were really cheap. I'm thinking with only 4 things on the menu, the food has to be phenomenal. I was wrong. Mediocre. The ribs were a dry rub with sauce on the side. The sauce tasted like bottled sauce. My corn was the smallest out of the group about 2 inches long. The slaw was watery and the baked beans tasted like a pound of sugar was dumped in it. I didn't try the corn bread. My friend's chicken wasn't cooked all the way and was pink by the bone so she didn't eat it.\n\nService was slllloooooooowwwwww. My 86 grandma walks faster than she does. It took about 15 mins (and I'm being generous) for our waitress to come over and give us menus and even longer for her to come back and take our order. She left her bifocals on our table and when we were finally able to flag her down she mentioned she was looking all over for it because she couldn't put in our order since she couldn't see the computer screen. Great. We probably waited about an hour for our food. I really wanted to walk out but my friends said to give it a couple of more mins. Luckily we got our food after that. \n\nOne thing I saw that really disturbed me was, I saw our waitress dumping water glasses full of ice into the water pitcher. I know what I saw. She had 3 of the red water glasses, the same one I was drinking out of and saw her dump all 3 one at a time into the water pitcher. I don't know if she was recycling customers drinking water or if she used the glasses as a vessel to carry ice. She then dropped ice on the counter and scooped it up off the counter with her bare hands and dumped it into the pitcher. I stopped drinking the water and told my friends not to drink it.\n\nThere was another waitress there, a younger one but she was more preoccupied with coming in and out of the restaurant. Can't tell you what she was doing but she wasn't working that's for sure. \n\nWhen our very frazzled and slow waitress finally brought our check, she actually gave us the wrong check. We had to flag her down and get the correct one. We spent another 15 mins waiting for her to come back with my friend's credit card. Actually she didn't come back so we went to her. My other friends went to go gamble while we dealt with her and my friend's now missing credit card. When she finally found it she hadn't processed it yet. While she was doing that she told us that the party before us forgot their credit card...uh..more like you forgot to give it back. \n\nAlso there was a young couple smoking their vapor there which I thought was rude and disrespectful. I overheard our waitress tell the young man \""oh you go boy, just like smoking a hookah\""...wow...just wow. We were there for more than 2 hours. Walk past this place and don't do it. Seriously not worth it."
1,"This club is definitely the BEST club I have ever been to in my life.  As soon as you walk in and see the pool surrounding the island bar and craps tables, you know that you are definitely doing it big in Vegas.  The place was awesome, very spacious, and crackin music.  The people were really nice, and there are a ton of places to sit even though you don't have table service.  Free cabanas, excellent vibe, and overall awesome experience.  This club made my trip to Vegas all worth it!  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED."
0,"This was absolutley the worst delivery service, pizza, management that I have ever had from any pizza dleivery company. The delivery guy gave me the bill first, and I put a tip on it, then wanted my credit card to take an imprint. I have ordered from other drivers at  Pizza Hut and they never asked me for a card! He was rude, and said he would not give me my pizza without it!! Then I opened the box, and there was a tiny amount of cheese on top of the pizza. I ordered the chese bacon stuffed crust pizza, and there was also no cheese or bacon in the crust!! I then called the store manager, who herself did not know how to handle this complaint call. Her excuse for the pizza was \""we are training our pizza maker's.\"" This was Saturdaty night!!! I asked for the Franchisee's phone number, and she refused. So she then said they would call me back!! No call....and not expecting any!! There are six other pizza restaurant's up here!  I have lived here for 11 years, and I was never treated or served a pizza like this, we were unable to eat it!! They need alot of help in training from the top down!! Good luck Pizza Hut. I want to all my neghbors, and fellow residents in Anthem to know about this!"
1,"Surprised at some of the reviews on here...please don't come here and expect the 5 star luxury that you see in some of the strip resorts like Aria and the Venetian....it's an older hotel and it shows in some areas.  That being said, A LOT of the rooms have been remodeled and refurbished so hope to be lucky enough to get one of these rooms OR ensure that you get a nice room with a $20 sandwich trick.\n\nThe staff was amazing...helped to the best of their ability and always very friendly, especially the valet staff.  Like I mentioned before, I did the $20 sandwich and got the bedroom portion of a suite - complete with flat screen, fridge, new pillow top mattress and nice bathroom.  It is kind of weird that part of the Star Trek theme is still in the casino...but no Star Trek Experience; still plenty of games there to play.  All in all - I would definitely stay here again especially since I drive into Vegas and therefore have transportation to the strip (2 minute drive)."
0,I have never been so disappointed in an oil change! First they took my car and told me they would contact me when it was ready so I was free to do some shopping in Costco next door.  They never called.  I walked back over to pick up my car to find they never touched it and refused to work on it.  They said they heard a noise in the engine and would not tell me what it was.  (I had it checked out at different place).  Sears told me my engine could blow up at any moment.  All that was wrong was the O2 sensor was broken (nothing to cause and engine to blow up).  These guys were just lazy and did not want to do any work.  They chose to scare me instead.  I will never go back to a Sears Auto Center for anything.
0,"After posting I decided to be fair and drop by again because there seem to be some really great reviews, well here is the update when I walked in I stood for about ten minutes waiting to be helped no one acknowledge me, they just stood there talking so I walked away from the counter and went to the window to watch the range again the people inside were sweating and they seem to be rushing a group through there shooting this was confirmed when the wife came out and seem a little upset, I asked here how it was going and she wasn't very happy she felt the range master was rushing them and talking down to them. She told me they had purchased a big plan so then could spend time shooting these very cool guns with their grown kids but they had no ideal there was a time limit until the range master began rushing them, \""that's why she walked out\"" she said it was a waste of a few hundred dollars. I told here next time try Pro Gun Club or Range702. So my experience at this hack gun range was not an isolated experience so beware of this place and just go Range702, Pro Gun Club, Green Valley gun range or the Gun store you will be happier I'm not sure of the other ranges near the strip. I read all the reviews posted it appears that ether you have a good experience or a bad one which makes me very dubious of the high rated reviews also most of those high rated reviews are very short and generic. Read the reviews of people who are taking the time to explain their review."
1,This place is hidden behind a gym and Pan Asian which could be a contributing factor as to why it's not super duper busy.. I love how the space is clean and not janky looking like most threading places. When I walked in I was immediately greeted by a nice smiling man who offered me bottled water. While you wait you can sip on some coffee from their cool coffee machine and watch Bollywood movies on their flat screen or you can browse the many perfumes and purses that have for sale. There were 2 ladies working so the wait was short. I got the same lady as last time but I forgot her name ;[[[ She's so sweet and did exactly what I asked her to do with my brows! Prices are your standard threading prices- $10 for brows.\n\nHOT TIP: Don't forget to ask for a loyalty stamp card ~!!!
0,Wow every time I come here there out of like 3 items always waiting.  And I come here at 1215 1230 prime lunch time.  Ans I don't have lots of time to wait around.    Chow mien out     Orange chicken out.  Really. Wow     But food is good.    But  prepare to wait
0,"I was just in Las Vegas this week. I enjoy the Rio and had Total Reward points,so I decided to go to their Carnival World Buffet. The system was very nice in terms of paying via their kiosk.  \nI had a taste for Chinese food.  The white rice was almost gone and what was left was ALL DRIED OUT!  The seafood was not impressive. The selection of food items was not exciting.  \nI did not care for this buffet as I have been to better ones.  \nThe waiter was lousy as he did not check to see if I wanted a refill on my beverage, so no tip for him!\nThere was absolutely nothing that I wanted seconds on.  \nIn Las Vegas, you should be able to find a better buffet."
0,"And what were the food critics of Travel & Leisure smoking when they voted Chou's \""Best Chinese Restaurants in the US\""? We've been hearing about this place for a year or so, everyone \""RAVES\"" about the food. We finally read about it in the Travel & Leisure and gave it a shot today for lunch at 12:15 PM. Coming from NYC and dining at the best tiny holes in the wall, our expectations were high especially based on previous reviews read.\n\nCustomer service was very friendly, though a bit slow. Now onto the food review, I knew we were in trouble when I ordered hot tea and I opened the lid to see if the tea was ready and it was a tea bag instead of tea leaves, additionally the water that was delivered to the table had a horrible taste to it. We order:\n-  Hot and sour soup for 2, may have been the best part of our lunch, good, but didn't pack a punch on either spicy or sour.\n-  Beef Pies, what's all the hype, took a bite and got a mouthful of greasy juice, ground up mystery meat which was wrapped in a fried pancake.\n- Steamed dumplings with pork and napa cabbage, again OK, these may have been the best choice out of all the dumplings, they came out hot and were OK tasting.\n- Fried pork buns, horrible, doughy and the filling had no taste.\n- Orange Chicken, OK tasting, a little heavy on the batter and was not orange tasting enough.\n\nAll in all not a repeat visit in our book and certainly not a Travel & Leisure's \""Best Chinese Restaurants in the US\"" vote from us."
1,"First the obvious, if you're after ice cream or gelato, cruise the streets a bit and check out the flavors available. Get a few free tastes, especially of the \""house specials.\"" We did the same, and one thing we found was that not every shop had well-frozen product. The last thing you need is ice cream already on its way to ice cream soup. We checked out Chez Catherine, and they almost dared us to try their Maple Taffy flavor. If you love maple syrup, maple flavor, this will knock your socks off! I had the Maple Taffy and Rum Raisin, scooped into a waffle cone. My wife got the Maple Taffy plus a scoop of Mint Chocolate, to sort of tame the sweetness of the Maple. The ice cream was good and firm, well frozen, and we were able to eat a large portion with a spoon, keeping the whole process a bit neater. After reaching the cone, it was pure heaven, with the cone plus the ice cream to enjoy. Seriously good ice cream, very friendly and attentive staff, and a delight to eat. Only problem? It's 2000 miles from our home!"
1,Best burger I've ever had (sweet and spicy burger). Awesome neighborhood place. Enough said.
1,I love this place! One of the best authentic Hawaiian dishes in Las Vegas.  Staff is super friendly. \n\nOn top of their regular menu they also have daily specials.  You never know what dish they will have available for these specials so its always good to visit frequently.\n\nIf your craving Hawaiian food this is the place to go!!! \n\nBe cautious if you are trying to take your lunch break and only have 30 minutes as they get really busy around noon.  I've seen the line as long as out the door.  My advice is to go prior to 12p.
1,"Born and Raised are Dog Friendly in their Patio area.  Yuppy!!!  \n\nThey treated Bentley (my dog) and I with red carpet during yesterday's game.  This was my first time there and certainly not the last.  The attention was incredible and so friendly.  The food was really good and very distinctively flavored.  I can tell you those chicken taquitos I had were not frozen and well priced.  Loved the ambiance inside and the plushy sofas inside, although I was sitting outside because I was with my dog.  Overall a great place, go ahead and try it."
0,"I am surprised by other reviews as we found EVO a disappointment.  Poor service, food was nothing to brag about (except the EVO salad), and A/C was blowing straight down on our table.  Could not make a cappuccino and the mushroom risotto was strong with flavoring of balsamic vinegar.  Do not recommend."
0,"Not a great show. The host was ok, first act was good.  Headliner was the opposite of good. Extremely disappointing.  Disappointed overall. Go to another comedy show if you can. Or know the comedian before you go."
0,"Went here while in PHX on business with a friend who lives locally.  Thought it would be a good place to have some dinner since i love BBQ.  No such luck.  Nothing seemed like real BBq  just over cooked and tasteless.  Very Chain resturant-y,  Cool memorabilia abut that's about it.  They only give a small cup of BBQ sauce for your meal.  I don't reccommend."
1,"I was looking to get my nails done quickly after work so I could get home. I stopped in here on my way home from work. They have GEL for $20.00 which is awesome because the last place I went to in Mint Hill charged $25.00. Also, the girl I had was really sweet and took her time. She gave me 5 coats of the gel. It was only my second time getting gel nails done and I find it doesn't damage your nails like the acrylics do. The gels also last for about 2 weeks. This place did a great job and had me out in about 20-25 min. \n\nI'll be coming back here again for sure!"
0,"Poor service, incredibly slow ticket times, two order mess-ups, and a FREEZING cold dining room made for a horrible lunch experience.  Took thirty minutes for our app to come out.  Had to ask for lemons for our tea three times before the waitress remembered to bring them out.  When our lunch entrees arrived, my friend's bacon cheeseburger which she ordered with Swiss cheese (she originally wanted American, which is still listed as an option on the menu but which they no longer carry according to the server) was topped with cheddar instead.  She decided to tough it out until she realized the bun was soaking wet (gross??).  That got sent back.  My other friend's food came ten minutes after the rest of us recieved our entrees due to a kitchen error.  I had the balsalmic dressing with my salad and I highly suggest you stay away from that...tastes like a mess of straight vinegar and peppercorns.  And wear a sweater.  AZ is hot and all, but that doesn't mean the AC needs to be turned down to 40*."
1,"*********Yes, the place is extremely NOISY**********\n\nYes, way to many people involved in serving you.\nYes, the Hot & Sour Soup, is to die for.\nYes, I have never had a marginal meal, in nine years.\nYes, I love to EAT AT FLO'S."
0,"What an unbelievable disappointment. The highlight of the meal was getting out of the terribly uncomfortable chairs as we left.\n\nWe had reservations through the hotel concierge but still had to wait for our table. When we were seated, we made the apparently unforgivable decision not to order alcohol and were promptly ignored by the waitstaff. It's been a long time since I've had such a grumpy waiter.  \n\nImagine my surprise when the waiter dropped off a plastic package of \""cracker-like\"" breadsticks. At the time I was surprised, but more was to come. We ordered a set of appetizers, a pizza, and a salad for the two of us, earning an impressive sigh and eye roll from the waiter who returned with a small plate of actual bread (from costco I think) with some oil and vinegar.\n\nNow, most Italian places take pride in their olive oil and vinegar, and with the chef Mario connection my expectations were high. But this oil might as well have been canola, and the vinegar was merely caramel colored and bland.\n\nAfter my water glass had been dry for about ten minutes someone showed up and dropped our appetizers on the table. The mozzarella was burned and the squash blossom was a grease bomb going off in my mouth. Both lacked any real flavor.  The caprese salad was a decent preparation, but the tomatoes were not very flavorful and the pesto had an unfortunate amount of mint.\n\nThe pizza arrived after another ten minutes. And was the wrong pizza. The girl who brought it offered to let us keep it, but was going to add it to our bill if we did. We really wanted the pizza we ordered, and when we said so she took the other pizza away in a huff.\n\n20 minutes later, our ordered truffle pizza arrived. It looked pretty good, smelled good, and we were excited that this might be turning around finally. Alas, I could barely get down one bite. My wife managed two. The pizza was bitter, the truffles were burned and flavorless, and the whole thing was drenched in the same flavorless oil that they served with the bread. \n\nThe high point of the meal turned out to be the prepackaged cracker sticks that arrived first. If course, the waiter wouldn't do anything about our 9/10ths uneaten meal, so for $70 we got to come back to our hotel room and snack from the minibar. Yuck."
1,"My friends drink here. Not in this universe, my friends actually think this place is too expensive, and kind of boring... but in an awesome parallel universe my real friends love it here. \n\nMy ideal friend that will share in a love of pub quizzes microbrews and crossword puzzles with me hangs out here. \n\nMy friend who finds beauty in the leather couches and big screen tv hangs out here. \n\nMy friend who appreciates the Man-Caviness of it all hangs out here - all the time actually. \n\nMy friend who doesn't like waiting 30 minutes to get a drink and needn't show the suppleness of her breasts to \""get some f**king service around here\"" is a big fan of this place. \n\nMy friend who knows about my freaky unnatural love of outdoor drinking arenas and either entertains it, or shares in it doesn't hang out anywhere but here. \n\nMy friends who know that a night out should mean you get to dress down, not dress up hangs here. He mostly wears flannels and has a beard, or at least some stubble.\n\nMy friend who appreciates the fine art of conversation that gets a little racy but because no one is taking shots never ends in an embarrassingly scandalous evening is there. \n\nMy friend who goes to beer festivals because her boyfriend is a home brewer - yea, she hangs out here too. She even brought me a six-pack of Aidan's (that's his name) prizewinning home brew. It's a little bitter, but good. \n\nWhen I go into Pear Tree I see all of these potential friends. And I love them like they were actually my own."
1,"Yum. Baja fresh is the place to go if you want something a step up from Chipotle in variety and warmth as far as the food goes. \nIt's not finger licking if I don't have this I\""m gonna die good, but the food is made fresh, and the customer service is always excellent\nHighlight: the plethora of salsa choices as well as fresh cut limes for your meal & if you so choose your coke like beverage. :)"
0,"First off, the place is very nice looking. We were excited to eat there, but the aesthetics were about the end of our enjoyment.\n\nWe started with potstickers which were good, but nothing special. \n\nWe decided to try out a couple of soups, the wonton noodle soup and a duck and BBQ beef soup. They were just terrible. They tasted like mop water. Our server did not drop them off and never returned to check on us or refill our waters. We finally flagged him down to get our check. He saw our uneaten meals and asked if we wanted to-go boxes. We told him no and he said okay and went to get the check. He never asked if we liked the food or why we didn't eat more of it.\n\nI'm sure there are other options that we would have enjoyed, but we won't be back to try them."
0,"Heard their ad on the local radio and decided to give them a call to clean some fabric dining room chairs.  They had a minimum trip fee, which was a little on the expensive side but we gave them a try anyway.  The technician that came out was very nice and knowledgeable and had the chairs looking like new in about 30 min!  About a month after the cleaning we started to see some of the stains returning.  After 90 days the stains had all returned.  I gave them a call and talked to two different people and was told they only have a 30 day guarantee and I would have to pay to have them come out again.  I asked for a supervisor and was transferred to a voice mail.  I left a message and am waiting to see if they will stand behind their service.  If they do I will write a new review!"
1,"Bobby Flay's recipes are flat out delicious, but I'm not sure if the price is worth what you get. The lounge atmosphere was nice (especially after a long day of travel!).\n\nFirst off, I am less than happy about the reservations setup there. My party had reservations for 10 for 12:30 and arrived about 15 minutes early ... but weren't seated until 15 minutes past our reservations. Given they had known we were coming for nearly a month, and we'd confirmed the reservations earlier that day, they should have made sure everything was ready. The delay *wasn't* because the tables were all full, incidentally - where we sat was empty and clean and waiting for us when we arrived. I'm also less than happy about the upsell for bottled water - they didn't offer ice water when we seated (just bottled water - sparkling or flat) and implied tap water was not available.\n\nMy party ended up ordering the Goat Cheese (\""Queso Fundido\"") with rajas and tortilla strips as an appitizer, and getting baskets of bread with a ciobatta, some sort of wheat bread with cranberries in it, and a chile cornbread. The Queso Fundido which was creamy and a little spicy and very delicious, and I could have happily eaten an entire order by myself. It wasn't as spicy as I had expected it to be, but that's ok, it was perfect with the goat cheese. The ciabatta and the wheat bread were great (I did eat almost the entire basket of that). I liked the chile cornbread, but thought it was really weak in the spice department and it was cold in the middle, like they had baked a bunch and froze them and just reheated it for lunch and got it in long enough that it was all thawed and the outsides were warmish, but the middle was still ice cold.\n\n\nFor entrees, many people ordered the Mesa Burger (double cheddar, grilled vidalia onion, and horseradish mustard on a house roll with southwest fries). One person ordered the Pressed Cuban Burger (which was a burger with ham, swiss cheese, pickles, dijon mustard, and roasted garlic mayo with adobo fries). I ordered the Grilled Mahi Mahi, which came with a roasted pineapple-cascabel chile sauce and a pineapple-green onion salsa. One person ordered the Yucatan Chicken Tacos (with grilled red onion and a peanut smoked chile BBQ sauce), and the person next to me ordered the New Mexico-style Pork Tenderloin Sandwich (with grilled red onion, arugula, ancho-chile mayo, and southwest fries).\n\n\nI quite enjoyed the Mahi Mahi. The pineapple-chile sauce was spicy enough to give a nice kick to the fish, and the pineapple-onion salsa gave a balancing sweetness. I ended up using some bread to mop up the last of the chile sauce because it was that good (and I was that hungry!). Everyone else seemed to quite enjoy their lunches as well.\n\nPrice-wise, there was some grumbling at the end that it was a little expensive for what you get. In my opinion, it cost a little more than I thought it was worth, but not so much that I would never return. The service was good (the reservation and water upselling issues aside), the food was excellent."
1,"I recently ordered a 14\"" thin crust pizza with pepperoni and sausage from this location. Although prep/delivery time took close to an hour, it was well worth the wait.\n\nThe pizza was piping hot and came with a generous amount of toppings, although I think the prep table applied too much cheese and less sauce to the center of the pie.  The sauce was savory with the right balance of spices.\n\nIn light of Michelle W's previous review, I'm inclined to give this location 4 stars instead of 5.  My rating may change if the consistency and quality continues to be above board with future orders."
0,"Bring back the original! There pasta is poor to avg, the portions were good but who cares when the food is avg.  Waiter couldnt get it right and came back a few times asking what we wanted. Whats that all about? I miss the Lombardinos in the 70's, 80's and early 90's."
1,Great pizza in a cool atmosphere. Liked being able to sit at the counter and watch the cooks at work.
1,"overall great hotel. Clean rooms, huge pools but most of all awesome buffet! My favorite in Vegas!"
0,"We came here around 7:15p tonih we walked in and read the sign that said to seat yourself and we did. The man behind the to go order counter area clearly saw us walk in... we waited,  and waited. For about ten minutes we waited for something... anything,  we got nothing... completely ignored. We left, I wonder if the people who went in as we were leaving got the same treatment?"
0,"This is actually no longer the Wyndham, it is a Renaissance now. While the hotel looks nice and the rooms are modernly decorated, the walls are PAPER THIN. I always expect a little bit of noise staying in a hotel, but when the person in the next room is talking at a normal volume at 2am, I shouldn't wake up thinking there is a person in my room. Every word said in the neighboring rooms could be heard, including the \""you look sexy in red...\"" conversation. Even though I have no complaints about the other aspects of my stay, I wouldn't stay here again. \n\nAlso, Wi-fi is $13 a day."
0,This resort is in need of serious renovations! The king bed sagged in the middle and was very uncomfortable. The pullout sofa literally had springs popping through the thin mattress. The pools were well over 100* and not refreshing at all. The last night we were there the fire alarm went off at 12:30am for over a half hour with loud pitch sirens to find out someone had pulled the alarm. Nothing about this resort was worth the money. The kids were quickly bored of the slides and all complained it pinched their skin and hurt their butts like a bruised feeling. We will not be back... Ever.
0,Disappointed.  Small portion for the money.  Tortillas were hard and cold.  And our server was too busy flirting with 60 something old ladies.  He didn't even offer to refill my soda.  I even had to go find him to pay.   1 star is for the ok food.   Service would get a zero
1,"I'm a big fan of the way they do things at Teriyaki madness. It's really nothing special, especially if you've ever visited a franchise known as The Flame Broiler back in California. But what these guys do, they do quite well.\n\nI usually get their chicken rice bowl with brown rice and extra hot sauce on the side. I suppose I could order their spicy bowl, but I don't see the point of paying extra for it when I can get the same sauce they presumably use to marinate their meat for free right next to the drink fountain. And the combination of their salty teriyaki glaze with the spicy tang of sriracha is just too addicting to pass up. \nYou can get their chicken veggie bowl if you want to moderate the meat consumption a little bit...but I can't bring myself to do that. \n\nIt's not the cheapest place to go for a quick bite at over 7 dollars a bowl, but you do get what you pay for. The portions are impressive and I guarantee you will be full if you can finish the whole thing. It's a popular choice among weightlifters or other fitness savvy folk and I think it's no mistake that these stores tend to be located next to gyms. It doesn't look particularly impressive inside but I highly suggest you order some carryout from this place and eat in a location catered to your comfort so that you can fully appreciate how good this grub can be."
1,"Almost just like the Hilton Garden Inn we stayed in the night before in Flagstaff, except much much newer (4.5 months old is what I thought I heard).\n\n* Free bottled water voucher\n* Free continental breakfast voucher for me, and free FULL breakfast voucher for my coworker... wtf!\n* Free internet\n* Nice, huge, glass shower\n* Super awesome shuttle driver who took us to dinner and drove us around ASU and Mills Ave for a quick tour\n\nWe paid $77 per person because it was partially comped by US Air, who made us miss the last flight to Atlanta. If not for the discounted price, I would give this place 4 stars...mostly because I'm still pissed that they gave me a \""lesser\"" breakfast voucher for being a Silver rather than Gold HHonors."
1,"I can't say enough about this place. I love to get lunch there, and leave with stuff to-go. They have some incredible home-made olives with different spices. I am an olive snob and can't say enough about them. You can also get hummus and baba ghanooj to go, as well as their freshly made (they are a bakery) pitas.  They also have some interesting mixes, canned beans, etc. They have a lot of Sadaf products which is cool because I used to actually mail order from them once in a while! \n\nOn the lunch side, I love all their vegetarian food and often get a vegetarian platter or falafel sandwich or plate, etc. Their tabouli is out of this world good - lots of fresh mint and parsley, lemon juice, it's perfect if you are into the Lebanese taste. I've never ordered meat there but I've seen other people order it and it looked great. The food is delicious and home made tasting. Their baklava is superb. Split some with your lunch mate. \n\nIf I were to succinctly describe their food it is fresh, healthy, authentic, and delicious. \n\nI gave it 5 stars. Not 5 stars like a fine dining type restaurant - 5 stars because they do their type of ethnic food with unfailing perfection and authenticity and consistency across multiple visits. \n\nMiddle Eastern Bakery is keepin it REAL yo! ( blatant fishing for cool ratings!)"
1,"This place is new at this location and it was packed, but something this particular area really needed.  They have a great Happy Hour from 4 to 6pm, very reasonable drinks and appetizers, $5, you cannot beat that.\n\nWe were lucky to get here early around 4:30ish which allowed us to get right in and get a seat.  By 6pm, there was a waiting line and every seat was filled.  With that being said, the management of this place was amazing.  There were plenty of servers and support staff and everyone worked together to get food out, drinks out and ensure the customers (US yea) were happy.\n\nThe food selection on the menu is a really nice selection and the food was good.  ONE CAUTION THOUGH.....\n\nOur server did say on the steaks that they season them and tend to over cook them so you should order less then what you want so you have a chance at getting what you want.  My wife found this out as she ordered a steak medium rare and it cam closer to medium well.  I am not sure why this is an issue here, however if the servers are aware of this, management should be as well and the cooks should be aware of it as well.\n\nThis maybe just part of growing pains as they did recently open in this area and since there are limited places in the area to choose from, the constant crowds and keeping up may be the challenge right now.  \n\nAside from that, everything else was great tasting, well prepared.  There is another one in town down on the strip area and for some reason the food at this location was better then the last visit we had to the one on the strip.  Not sure why, but I guess we will now have to give both a try and see which one is better managed and which cooks take more pride in what they serve.\n\nWe will be back to both locations, however the newer one, definitely around 4pm when happy hour starts because by dinner time, you will be waiting for a table and I would rather be happy early then hungry later...."
0,"We ordered 4 sandwiches, Meatball, Chicken Parmasean and 2 of the pesto chicken hoagies.  The sandwiches were delivered, they were supposed to be hot, but were luke warm at best when they arrived, very bland, no flavor, and to make things worse we paid $45 for the 4 sandwiches to be delivered, but that isn't the worst part!!!  The next morning my son was violently ill, puking all over the place, and I will spare you the details of everything else, but he had food poisoning.  I called Streets of New York to tell them about it, and was met with a rude manager that questioned me to death, and didn't think that it was their food that made my son sick! Maybe if I didn't work as a chef, then I may have had it wrong, but I told the manager that I worked with food on a daily basis, and she still seemed to think that either I was making it up, or I was jsut wrong. Very, very , very disappointed, will never order thru them again, and I would advise that you check your food if you order with them, make sure you don't get sick too!"
1,"Love + Jack.  Meaning we got 2 different combos they had.  I noticed they put \""Beef Shirt Ribs\"" instead of Beef Short Ribs.  Gave us a good giggle from the beginning.  One of the best meals I had the 5 days I was in Vegas.  A friend that lives out there took us out here because we were craving asian food.  We got a ton of food that 6 people could not finish.  The guys tried desperately to finish the last of the pork...but we just couldn't put it down.  The one thing I really liked about this place was, with each combo you get a bottle soju.  The standard green bottle pretty much all korean places have.  I liked it =).  Not far from everything we wanted to do, and a decent price.  About $100 for 6 people?  Included with 2 bottles of soju...I think that's a great deal when your are in Vegas!\n\n11pm - 8am they have a happy hour.  Something sort of different for a place like this.  20% off!  Probably why our meal was so cheap =)"
1,"Simple, homey and well done comfort food. Terrific goulash!"
1,"This place is as close to heaven as you can get if you are an outdoor enthusiast! \n\nThe store is huge with the largest selection of fishing gear that I have seen in a long time. \n\nThey have an indoor shooting range if you are into that kind of thing and they have cool aquariums with different fish species that are native to the area.\n\nI mainly come here to buy clothes and gear for work. They have a large selection of warm weather gear and rugged boots.  The only down side for me is they don't carry steel toed boots for women!  What?!  Like we don't want our little piggies protected?!\n\nAnyways, outside of that minor flaw this place rocks and is a must visit for those looking for something out of the ordinary when visiting Las Vegas!"
1,"Get there early if you want more selection of bagels. These bagels toast up really well, crispy on the outside but tender on the inside. Dang it, I all of a sudden want a bagel."
0,"I want to love Viva Chicken.  I really do.  I LOVE peruvian food and live just two minutes down the road.  I have now been three times, and it has slipped each time.  \n\nEvery visit I have shared the chicken and the classic saltados (stir fried beef, tomatoes, onions, and french fries in a vinegary soy sauce.)  My first experience was a solid 4 stars.   The chicken was juicy and flavorful and the saltados were on point.   I should mention that saltados would likely be my desert island food choice.  I love almost every version.  \nOn visit two, the chicken was ok.  Not as flavorful as I remembered, but still good.  The saltados however were kind of dismal.  Dry, tough beef and completely disintegrated fries.  It was almost like it had been sitting for a while, even thought I know that wasn't the case.   I left just a little unsatisfied.  \n\nRound three was just kind of sad.  I was determined to relive my fist experience, so I returned again.   The chicken skin was cold and flabby.  The saltados had a weird, charred quality to them with no decernable sauce.   Even the dulce de leche cookies for dessert were bad; sandy and stale this time.  \n\nThe service however is impeccable.  They really try to provide a great experience.  If only the kitchen had the same consistency."
1,"I remember staying here for a weekend and was expecting it to be too mature of a place for us, young, girls to enjoy Vegas.\nHowever, this is one of the few times I was pleasantly mistaken. \nStaying at Bellagio was a great experience. The service from the front desk to the bell hop to the room service. Everything exceeded my expectations.\nThe room was quite roomy for 2 double beds and even a living area. Customer service went beyond protocol- customer service with a smile would be an understatement.\nBellagio ranks among the top places to stay, IMO, and I would recommend this spot to anyone planning a trip to sin city."
0,"I came here during the \""Mtl \u00e0 table\"" festival, a festival that allows foodies to try out new restaurants at a fraction of the price. I was looking forward to this since I've been here before but only to have a drink. I started out with the bison tartare which was very tasty. It's after that that things started to deteriorate. We waited 45 minutes for our main course and when I spotted the waitress with our dishes I said to my friend that we're finally going to eat. Since she was facing the kitchen she said that she hoped not since those plates have been sitting next to the bar for quite a while. Sure enough, those were our plates. My osso bucco was still warm, but she said that her fish was a bit cold. Because we were so famished she didn't say anything. Speaking of my osso bucco, it was bland. There was no seasoning at all. Disappointing. I was really looking forward to the dessert since I love anything sweet. My pudding chomeur consisted of a dry white cake with caramel on top. The cake was so dry that the caramel couldn't even moisten it, which is what it's supposed to do. I've had a better pudding chomeur at rotisserie St-Hubert.\n\nBecause this was during the Mtl \u00e0 table festival, I paid a set price of 39$ for my food. At that price, I felt that it was slightly overpriced for what I got. However had I went any other time, the same meal would've cost me 54$?! That's just insane. There are better and cheaper options nearby. \n\nAnother thing; there are a couple of reviews that mention the loudness of the music. I have to agree with them. Is it necessary to blast music at 6pm? People are eating and we can barely carry on a conversation. Raise the volume at 10pm, but prior to that keep it low."
1,"I am not a big fan of coffee, but I have been trying new things, like trying different types of coffee other than *bucks or TRYING to like wine. Anyway, I usually get my sugar and caffeine fix from *bucks once a month because it's the only place I know and it's everywhere.\n\nOnce I had John's coffee, I had a wake up call. I realized that I absolutley hate corporate chain coffee shops. The espresso was perfect. It had right amount of bitterness, it was fresh and the aroma was heavenly."
0,"I have to remember, just because its near my house doesn't mean it's gonna be better!\n\nViva Michoacan and Lindo Michoacan  have such better food an atmosphere, I've learned my lesson to take the extra time and gas and get some good food.\n Our waiter was friendly, and full of energy, he made the experience better. \nThe free tortilla chips were dark and over fried, also tasteless. The bean dip and salsa were okay, just seemed not as hot (spicy). The fideo soup was watery with about 20 noodles in it, I mean, it is so cheap to make fideo and this is what I get? I got a Soft Beef Taco and a Crunchy Chicken Taco, there was so much lettuce and shreded cheddar cheese on top I had to dig my way to my tacos. Both were edible and had a good amount of meat but didn't have much taste even after I drenched them in salsa. The crunchy taco was a little greasy. I actually thought they'd be more like street tacos since that's what I'm served at the sister restaurants.\nMy husband got the Carne Asada Burrito, but he had them add cheese and mole sauce which they gladly did, it was okay, but was still missing something...especially some heat (spice).\n\nI won't be going back, especially since there are so many better mexican restaurants."
1,Steak fajitas and margaritas were solid. Next time we are getting one of those monster orders of nachos!
0,Disgusting dispatch service and drivers that LOVE to sexually harrass women and take them on terror rides not letting them out of the cab. Twice already they've been reported Taxi Authority. Since drivers went on strike they're hiring psychos and allowing Vegas locals to be long-hauled and disrespected. Worse service by far. I am a local in Vegas so heed this warning. For 4 years this cab company has been ruining our tourism by displaying Neanderthal business practices and hiring sexual offenders and criminals. Nice job Ace. Tourists and locals seek anyone.but this.company and their sister cab companies. Deposits for drivers dont exist. Taking the expressway NOT the only way to get to a location. Take their cab number name and time they we were working. Call their employment and the Taxi Authority. Its that easy to report a negative experince.
1,"Huge portions,  great food, friendly and attentive staff.  1st time trying The Place and it did not disappoint. My 14 old son couldn't even finish the 16oz steak and eggs. We will definitely be coming back."
1,"Went in not knowing exactly what I wanted, just that I wanted something really nice. Was immediately greeted by a gentleman who offered his assistance.  Told him I wanted something to compliment a beautiful lady. He said give him 5 minutes and he will have something nice made up. He went to work and made a beautiful arrangement that was beyond what I expected. I love giving flowers to my lady and this florist has just made themselves a loyal customer."
0,"I ordered pictures through the online photo center and requested them to be printed and picked up from this location. I selected and paid extra for same day prints and were told online that they'd be ready in 1-3 hours. I went to pick them up several hours later and the guy behind the counter couldn't find my photos. He said, \""Oh, it must be because our printer is out of ink, we should have your prints on Friday or Saturday\"" This is Wednesday, I need them today! If I wanted them in 4 days I would have paid $10 less! I asked for them to send my file to another location so that they could be printed there. No such luck, they said they were not able to do that. Now I have to upload, size and crop all of my photos again and reorder them to be picked up from another store. If they would have just called me this morning and told me the problem, I would have my pictures in time. Now, it's far too late for any Rite Aid to print my photos tonight. Come on people, communicate with your customers! Thanks for nothing!\n\nGo to the Baum location. It's just around the corner and far nicer inside."
1,"Another good burger, but this time it was at the Old Town location. Well cooked, hot and good fries and only $7.50 for the All-American burger at HH. Also, use the YELP check-in for five more bucks off. Much better crowd, but still a bit grey until the winter visitors head home and it is indeed about time folks."
1,"You know how in some 80's-late 90's movies there's that one new person that comes into class and everyone's like, \""Daaaaaaaaayum!\""?\n\nThat \""person\"" is this restaurant.\n\nI went here last night with my significant other for our anniversary dinner and it was just too good. I got the braised beef short ribs which came with gnocchi and swiss chard (I had the cipollini removed due to food allergies). The gnocchi was so tender it melted in my mouth and had a wonderful buttery taste, some had a more bitter taste because of being placed near the swiss chard. My significant other got the pork shoulder agrodolce and thought it was \""good\"" (his words, not mine.) It had an almost barbecue-like taste to it because of the cannellini beans.\n\nBoth of us got the same dessert, the Torta which was a sponge cake with a coffee mousse, some maple agrodolce on the plate with a coconut gelato on the side. The gelato barely had a coconut taste, but it was very nice and not too sweet.\n\nService was nice, our waitress came at the right time and refilled our glasses and anything else we might have needed. The place is a little small, but I think it adds to its charm. A little difficult to hear the person you're with sometimes, though.\n\nThe only complaint I've really got about this place is that there's some disjoint to the dishes: for example, two of the items on my plate (short ribs and gnocchi) were savory, and then had one extremely bitter item (swiss chard) that seemed out of place. This was the same issue with the dessert--the coconut gelato, maple agrodolce, and cake were all fairly sweet--and then the coffee taste from the mousse and the coffee grounds on the side made for a really awkward and overwhelming taste. I'd much prefer it if the entire plate was balanced, but that's a personal preference.\n\nOverall, I really liked this place and would definitely come back. Daaaayum, Nostrano, you lookin' fine."
1,"Good coffee, personable staff, and convenient location, but the drive-thru can be slow."
1,"This place is outstanding! Great deal for french country bistro food. Very reasonable pricing, $20 for 3 course menu or order a la carte even cheaper.\n\nI am the youngest person in there by about 40 years every time I go but I don't care, I don't know anywhere else in the valley that has the same combo of charm, service, food quality, and cheap prices as this place. \nIs the food culinary magic? NO, but who would expect it to be at $20 for 3 courses?  Are portions huge? NO, but you can't even get out of cheesecake factory at that price (not that I'd want 3 courses at cheesecake, but you get the idea...).\n\nUnfortunately word is getting out and it is getting more and more crowded every time I go!! Great part is they will sometimes allow overflow to sit in one of the actual Vincent's dining rooms which instantly expands seating!"
0,"Stayed at the Monte Carlo over the weekend because I had comp'ed rooms.  I would not pay to stay here.  Although the casino itself is nice, the room was bad.  My biggest complaint is the walls are super thin.  You can hear people talking and walking in the halls, you can hear muffled conversations of the people in the rooms adjacent to you.  You can also hear all the water in the pipes whenever another room flushes a toilet or showers.  On my last day, a Monday, there was construction in our hall and you could hear banging and drilling.  If I wasn't leaving first thing in the morning, I would've have been extremely upset by the noise."
1,"Delicious pizza!! We had the white pizza with mozzarella, ricotta, and basil. It's a little on the pricey side but well worth it! Also had the arancini balls, same thing a little pricey though very good! Service was great too. Would definitely go back."
1,"There are not many cities in the world which offer something as unique, exciting and popular as the Edinburgh Fringe Festival.\n\nSet over the month of August, the centre of Edinburgh is taken over by tourists enjoying comedy, plays, musicals, dance, opera and street performers. If there was ever anything that summed up the phrase \""something for everyone\"" it's the Edinburgh Festival. There is a mixture of the great, the terrible and the completley mad but you are guaranteed entertainment. There are a number of venues around Edinburgh offering a huge number of shows by new and old performers and some famous faces thrown in. I met McLovin last year at the Festival. Oh yes, I pretty much don't need to ever meet a famous person again because McLovin wins at everything. \n\nIf you are in Edinburgh in August, you have no excuse to miss the Festival."
1,"If you like Hummus, Falafel, Salad, Chicken, Lamb, Cheap awesome food, great middle eastern markets, tziki, or anything else good in this world.  Then go to Haji-Baba.  They have the best lunch specials.  Their falafel pita is probably the greatest deal in history.  I lived off this for a time."
0,"Wow. Sad and dismal letdown both in food and in service.\nI was on a hop out to LA and had a bit of time to kill.\nFood was a great idea as the stomach was empty and my reserve light was on. That could only mean i had a one hr max to find fuel or shut the engine down.\nEnter... the 12th fairway. Wow... it looked good from the outside.\nHad a golf feel to it. Sure, why not... thought the man who was desperate.\n\nWell, I should have focused on the NOT and I do heavily emphasize the WHY!\n\nThe sandwich was dismal and service even worse. Never have i had a burger that limp, downtrodden or beaten up. The onion rings were more like overcooked batter. \n\nNext time, i'm shutting down the motor faced with the same choice of hunger pangs or 12th fairway. Now i know why they invented Snickers."
0,"Wow.  Just wow.\n\nEven if you have presale tickets, they make you wait behind the notorious velvet rope now just to get to the dance floor.  Most of Surrender is now outside where Encore Beach Club is and if you don't come pretty early, it's almost impossible to get to the dance floor to see the DJ.  What's the point in coming here if only 10% of the guests can actually see the talent instead of watching them on a screen outside?\n\nEven if you do get in, it's crammed like hell in there.  They rope off the right side for VIP tables and the left side for the bar.  If you are next to the stage, good luck getting out to get a drink or even use the restroom.  You won't be able to.  Horrible, HORRIBLE experience.  I am never coming back here for as long as I live.  Mark my words.  I hope they don't eff up Splash Dance and do the same lame set up."
1,"Today was my 3rd massage here.  I've had wonderful experiences each time.  They have a meditation room for pre-massage relaxation, locker rooms & complimentary lockers, shower rooms if you choose, and dry sauna for post massage detox.  My only complaint would be the price.  1 hr massage was $80, not as expensive as the strip but I think other places average $70/hr.  I'd still go back though."
1,Love this place!!! Great service! Pedi! Much needed!!! A deluxe pedi w/ an amazing massage! Oh how I needed this!
1,"Wow! Never have I had such tender meat that wasn't cooked in a crock pot for 24 hours. The brisket and pork shoulder were delicious, not to mention top-notch macaroni and cheese and cornbread. The unique picnic-table setup encourages conversation. I feel sorry for vegans because they're the only people who won't enjoy this restaurant."
1,Wow what a great flavor for the dishes we had it was nearly impossible to stop eating even after our belly was completely full. The waiter was really great as well knew the food and had been there since the place opened. He gave is great recommendations all super delish. It was a really positive experience we will go back!
1,"If you're looking for a more chic/upscale Mexican place and not wanting to deal with the strip...\n\n*Great Mexican place for Vegetarians\n\nThe service was very good and prompt. They tell you about the specials when they give you the menu - they had 4 additional options that night.\nFavorite thing about this place - Margaritas. They use Agave, silver tequila and lime juice...so simple but it's my favorite. \nThe salsa and guacamole is ok. The salsa doesn't have a special taste nor did the guac. I love spicy guac or to have the option at least. \n\nFor dinner - \nSweet Chipotle glaze shrimp tamale. LOVED this! I loved the spiciness of the red sauce. Very good sweet/spicy mix and very creamy corn for the tamale.\n\nSkirt steak - Anytime I can get arrachera, I will do so. This was a very good dish with a side of sauteed spinach with onions and jalapenos. I'm not sure how long they marinade it for, but arrachera usually has a ton of flavor in it. This one was good and tender, just not as much flavor as I'm used to. \n\nMy friend had one of the specials - Pan seared scallops on a bed of rice pilaf. It also was very good. The scallops where very tender and not rubbery tasting like a lot of places around here serve. \n\nOverall, I liked this place a lot. I think it's a lovely modern setting for a nice date or a small group of people with good food and drinks."
1,"What can I say, it's a hospital. I think for the most part everyone hates the hospital, whether it be  if you're going in for something yourself, visiting someone else, or even just talking about the food, who really likes the hospital?\n\nMountain View isn't too bad. There are many hospitals in Vegas and I have been a patient at five of them. I have to say that Mountain View was not a bad experience for me. \n\nMy first experience at Mountain View was when I had my first baby. I had a regular delivery and I was in labor for 14 hours. The labor and delivery nurses were great. They were very patient with me and I felt very comfortable the whole time. After my delivery, I was moved to the postpartum side and the nurses there were just as nice and helpful. I has no issues during my stay here. I was also able to have my own private room during my stay which was great, as it allowed me to get some sleep and it was great for that family privacy and bonding time with our new baby. They brought in a roll away bed for my husband so he could stay the night with me. The nurses also showed us where we could help ourselves to sandwiches, sodas, juices, fruit and pudding cups, which came in handy during the middle of the night. \n\nMy second experience at Mountain View was for a full spinal fusion, where they went through my stomach and placed a metal cage on my spine. Then they rolled me over and and screwed it into place through my back. I was in surgery for six hours. I woke up in intensive care and spent a week in the hospital with 40 staples up my stomach and 40 staples up my spine. To top things off I was also in a back brace. During my week stay at Mountain View, the nurses were really patient with me and they helped me with everything. Again, I was able to have my own private room, which was great because I was there for a week and I was pretty messed up, so by the time I was able to start getting out of bed it was nice to have my own bathroom and space to move around. The worst part about my stay was the physical therapy lady that kept coming in my room to make me start moving again. I would just pretend I was asleep, but she would always just come back........Boooooo! \n\nAs for the dreaded hospital food........ Mountain View isn't bad at all, as long as you are not on a restricted diet. You have a menu and you can order whatever you want off the menu. They cook what you want to order! I stuck to the things that I knew were hard to mess up, like chicken strips and french fries, and they were always pretty yummy. I would even order Pepsi, not bad for a hospital! The trick is to order early, because if not you will have to wait a while, because they do make food to order. \nIt is way better than the food at other hospitals in the area because it's not the food that they bring in on the tray and you lift off the lid and surprise....... you have no idea what the mystery meat is!"
1,"This place is great... Fun atmosphere,  great fast food and amazing shakes-more flavors then you can imagine."
0,"Everytime I go here, I leave telling myself that their [wash once and throw away quality] clothing and their incomparable high prices should be reminder enough not to return, but somehow I digress.  So on my last trip to Kohl's, Scott, my checkout cashier, greeted me with a monotone voice and flat affect. That coupled with the fact that he didn't know how to count back change [but rather held out his hand and dumped all my coins and dollars into my palm] was the last straw! Terrible!  The store should be embarrassed. Please. Try to hire young employee's with even a little bit of professionalism."
0,"Great location. Great atmosphere.  Disappointing food.\n\nWe had the steamed mussels as our appetizer.  It was just ok; there were at least six mussels that weren't opened and we didn't chance eating them. \n\nMy risotto was so overcooked ... Duck, order medium, served very rare.  Wife's pan roasted grouper had so much olive oil you couldn't taste anything else.  \n\nFor desert we ordered the Espresso Cheesecake with Hazelnuts and they forgot to put the hazelnuts on (and the small cupcake sized cheesecake served on huge plate was a joke).\n\nI would not return or recomend Vivace."
1,"The food was excellent, wait staff very efficient and the parking was easily accessible and convenient.  All meals were very reasonable in price as well as the drinks.  Could use a larger wine variety."
0,If I could give Mark Taylor no stars I would. All of their leasing clowns get $11.25 hour.\nGreat pay for what they do! I guess they are told to not let U.S. VETS be approved. My credit score was .3 below acceptable for their $99 security deposit. They wanted a $100 more plus rent would go up $40 per month. The 2 things on the credit report were even listed as identity theft. They didn't care. A women named Amanda said tough no refund for the apartment. Mark Taylor is a true SCUMBAG!

1,"Had my first visit at Free House a couple of weeks ago and just now have time to write a review. First lets talk about about the ambiance, very spacious, live music (not a band, but a fiddler and banjo type) which in my book was great, tons of big screens, and low lighting which i enjoy for a casual dinner. We had a party of 3 and opted to sit at the bar, we came just to check it out, grab a couple drinks and maybe some apps. For my first round i got a whiskey sour, nothing to be impressed about but wasn't terrible either, the other 2 got beers they've never had, they liked them. 2nd round i got a chocolate stout, which i throughly enjoyed. Now onto food, we got the sweet potato fries with smoked ketchup, im not a huge ketchup fan to begin with but even i liked it! We also got the parm fries with lemon aoli sauce VERY GOOD sauce, the fries were cooked perfectly also, not soggie or too crunchy. I wanted to try something different so i ordered us the deviled eggs, because how often do you see that on a menu?? I really liked them, i mean it's hard to mess up a deviled egg but all the extras they put on it were great, fresh cooked bacon, sirracha, and chives! I would totally recommend them. The reason why im only giving a 4 is, the bartender (also are server) was kind of a crab, wasn't friendly, didn't care to give us recommendations, through our food and menus down, didn't come to check on us, seemed to be only focused on a couple of women at the opposite end of the bar, but hey we all have those days i guess. We'll probably come back for an actual meal but would probably sit at a table next time."
0,"After hearing great things from the concierge at our hotel and all the other yelp reviews we thought this was gonna be a great meal. The smoking mirrors cocktail was amazing it was brought out on a smoking wine barrel stave with the glass inverted and filled with smoke and then flipped over and the drink poured in ! It was a great drink! However then the food came it was just bad....over seasoned and ridiculously heavy...the fish was over cooked and too greasy, the steak sauce was heavy and off, our octopus salad was good but again extremely heavy .   I would not recommend this restaurant to eat ..get the smoking mirrors at the bar and then hudini and find another place!"
1,JUST DO IT! The party in your mouth will not let you down!
0,"Terrible DJ. Watered down drinks. Extremely poor service. On a slow night we had to walk the restaurant to find our server and he hadn't been back in 25 minutes. The reviews on here are spot on. Great location, but you wonder if there is even a manger here. \n\nWe ordered the brownie for dessert and it might have been the worst restaurant brownie I've ever had. Literally tasted like they took it out of the freeze, unwrapped it and put it on our table. After we paid the bill ($53 for 3 small, watered down drinks and a brownie) our server said he'd take it off the bill (there was one bite gone after an hour) but then couldn't remove it because he said he ran the card already. \n\nDon't come here."
1,"Best burger joint I've had in Vegas (which is, admittedly, few), but it stands up to the best in LA.  The fare is effectively a riff on Fatburger, but they've done a much better job and introduced a Mexican food twist to the cuisine if you desire.  Not only can you get one of the best and most affordable burgers in Vegas, but you can get a take out pizza for $6.  Unheard of."
1,"Awesome staff. Sat at the counter and watched tons of great looking food go by. I went for the \""Lil ol Country Girl\"" which is an egg, bacon, sausage, and biscuit and gravy. The kitchen claims proudly \""I come from a family where gravy is considered a beverage.\"" And they delivered the best gravy I've ever passed by my lips. We will definitely be back."
1,I think this was one of the best meals I had in Vegas! Lots of different kinds of meat and an excellent salad bar. The service was amazing!  Pampas has a great staff. I recommend making a reservation - we were there on a Sunday night and it was CRAZY!
1,"Watched a show at the Mirage and afterwards came here to eat. They had excellent sliders, fries, and buffalo wings. I would have ate more if I hadn't drank so much! The grade of meat they use here is excellent and service was very good. Would recommend you try this place out if you want a good tasting hamburger. They even have wagyu burgers!"
1,"The hours kind of suck but with the personal and amazingly awesome care you get... Who cares?  Everyone is amazing Alice, Lexi, et al. They are wonderful and nice. My family and I go mostly after church on Sunday and it's such a treat to look forward to. Their chicken fried steak is amazing as is the taco salad. Another good mention is the burritos they are massive and always delightful make sure to order them smothered."
1,"Went here last night with my boyfriend and was not disappointed. It's a pretty small space so expect to wait a little while even if you go there on a week night. The bar is great and drinks are reasonably priced. We didn't get an appetizer but we both had burgers that were very good. He had the classic burger and I had the pimento cheese burger. The pepper jam is to die for! Both of our burgers were a little bit more well done than we would have liked (we like ours medium rare, a little more towards rare), but still good. I am gluten free and was very impressed with their gluten free menu...it's pretty extensive! And they offer gluten free buns which is great and definitely not something you get everywhere. The fries were decent, but as my boyfriend pointed out tasted like something you can buy at the grocery store and make yourself. Didn't get to try a milkshake as we were so full but next time that will definitely be the first thing I order!"
0,"Worst experience ever! I have severe neck pain, and I was hoping he could help me, but instead he said there was nothing he could do for me. I talked to him for maybe 2 minutes, and he just left. The worst part is that I paid $55 to see him! I felt like I was robbed walking out of there. I went to urgent care after that and they gave me a steroid prescription, and 800 mg ibu's which took care of the pain. Thanks for nothing Dr. Moody, and I would like my $ back please."
1,"I had the pad thai shrimp and chicken combo and mango curry with white rice (split between two people ) My mother had the laad. \n\nFirst of all the pad thai no peanuts combo was amazing I've always gone to the thai orchard garden and have had thai basil but this place set a higher bar than both! the fresh lime was something I've never thought of. \nThe mango curry-medium spice was heaven on earth especially with the white rice!\nLastly the Laad yes, I stole a few bites from moms plate. I'm a HUGE texture eater so I was pretty hesitant. the flavor was spicy and flavorful..you will not loose any flavor from the spice. Portion was more than generous and if you run out of lettuce and cucumbers try it with rice! \n\nOk I guess I'm not done. To top off this hidden treasure I tried the mango sticky rice dessert all I can say is OMG!! 50 cents quote \""I love you like a fat kid loves cake\"" is no more insert now \"" I love you like a fat kid loves mango sticky rice!\"""
0,"Dr. Ena Lee is the most judgmental, condescending and rude healthcare provider I have ever had. She was rude every time I went in and missed major issues in my dental care.  Dr. Spiewak tried a little too hard to get my husband to buy expensive and unnecessary procedures and cosmetic treatments.  They charge way more than the going rate even for a simple cleaning and do tons of unneeded xrays most insurances won't even cover. I went 3 different times and really gave Dr. Lee a chance to be nice, but trust me, she's incapable.  Also, don't try to get your records for free - they charge to transfer them."
1,"Kristy does amazing work. I am so happy she is back from Denver, she did my hair prior to leaving for a year or two. Hair coloring, new styles, eyebrow waxing, she even does make up services. I've walked out of there looking like a million bucks many times! Her haircuts last too! They keep their shape and functionality. You are missing out of you don't visit her!"
0,"I have used irrigation with SPR for over 30 years. They have really dedicated people who go out of their way to be helpful. The Zanjeros were always available and  ready to work out some water issue, and they  are varied and frequent (like a neighbors dead animal in a canal) . So for many years I have been a big fan of SRP.\n\nUntil today!\n\nI needed to pay my water assessment so I went to the main office.\n1. Now a security guard tells you you are in the wrong place, no more receptionist.\n2. The payment  center was closed and turned into  a closet with some machines in it.\n3. Customer service is now a telephone on a brown wall with a sign over the phone saying call for customer service.\n\nZanjeros are now computer baby sitters for the nee Water Master system. Getting a consistent flow is a real challenge now. They are ready to add time but after you get shorted 20 minutes you have to move to a new user and it really does not work to then get 20 minutes delivered the next day. The person responsible  for the Water master needs to be required to meet users at 2am when the order gets shorted by the system.\n\nWhen I called today I spoke to an old style SRP person but you might as well visit the prison as use this facility, So no matter what the literature says SRP is now just another big faceless utility doing their level best to isolate the customer."
1,"I went to this show for my bachelor Party this past weekend on Saturday March 2nd. It was one of the greatest shows ever!!!! I got hypnotized, and it was HILARIOUS!! Everybody had an awesome time, my friends said they have never laughed so hard!! You have to do this while you are in Vegas!! It is a must!!"
0,"This place was not good. I dont understand how it has so many good reviews.  I had the veggie platter/combo that comes with all the dips like hummus, tabbouli, etc plus some falafel an dolmades.   The pita was not good - just the flat cheap they buy.  I miss the doughy round pita freshly baked in brick ovens. My fiance's mousaka was disgusting, served almost like a soup."
1,Went in for a pulled leg muscle.  The staff was very friendly and knowledgeable.  They have a large therapy room with a lot of sports specific equipment.  They were thorough in examining my leg and even noticed my ankle hadn't healed right from a break 15 years ago.  I would highly recommend them to anyone in need of PT.
1,"Gay cowboys, rambunctious line dancing, and $5 pitchers of beer. I really don't know what else I could ask for! It's a good place to drink copious amounts and channel your inner dancing queen without judgement. (Trust me, regardless of what you're doing/wearing, you CANNOT compete with that 6'2\"" drag queen grinding against the mirror.) \n\nAs a woman, I like going to a bar where I don't have to worry about drunk losers trying to hit on me. If you like country music, get here before midnight. Otherwise, club music starts at 12 and that's when the top 40s playlist will start going...think Lady Gaga, Beyonce, etc. \n\nJust be prepared. It's a loud, big, gay bar, and the men here are brave. People rip off their shirts and start getting pretty wild on the dance floor. If you can handle that, you'll have a good time."
1,"I've been looking for a rock-n-roll bar for awhile....so glad to find this joint, even if it's a bit far from home!"
0,Ate at Outback for lunch with my family. Went back to hotel and vomited for the next 13 hours. Cause? You decide.
1,"the buffet was \""picture perfect\""... i felt like i was a judge on top chef! \neverything was displayed and presented so beautifully!\n\nthey had a number of different types of \""stations\"": fruit, asian, omelet, meat, italian, salad, dessert, etc.\n\nthe food was tasty too! some of the dishes were of course tastier than other dishes. I had like 5 plates of food... and i was there for over 2 hours! \n\ntheir dessert bar is amazing! :) they have a gelato bar INSIDE the buffet... their waffle cone is very tasty! i loved their chocolate covered strawberries! :) nom. nom. nom!\n\nby the way, I came here for LUNCH - $22.70"
0,"Pretty disappointed! Visually the restaurant looked nice. The food on the other hand was a different story. The Dinuguan that I ordered barely had \""meat\"" on it! Was mostly pieces of Fat/Lard and it was not served warm/hot. Would not go back there again!!"
0,"So, I was in the mood for a good gyro.  I typed \""gyro\"" into Yelp, and this place was top on the list.  We headed there, and guess what?  They don't have gyros!!!   I got over it and ordered the Steak Shwarrma.  Well, my wife and I were both unimpressed.  The steak was very dry.  It was almost like warm beef jerky.  Flavor wise, the whole thing was utterly bland.  Sadly, the marinated carrots were the most flavorful thing we had.  My five year old son wanted nothing to do with the place.  They only offer three kids options. Perhaps the salads are the main draw here, but I am not going to be taking that chance considering the number of places to eat in town."
1,"This was my second time having Thai food period (First place I went to was Thai Palace  BBQ on Jones and YUCK!), but the first time I'd visted Basil 'n Lime and I died and went to food heaven. OMG! This place had amazing food. I was starving when I got there so I went for whatever looked familiar to me: Crab Rangoos and Kung Pao Chicken. By far, this was the tastiest, freshest, most flavorful plate of Kung Pao I've ever eaten. My dads GF initially recommeded this restaurant to me a while back, but I just kept driving past it day by day on my way home not wanting to take her word for it. Big mistake! This is the place to be for yummy Asian cuisine, its piping hot when it comes to the table and tastes so very homemade. I got a level 3 spicy and that was not hot at all for me, so next time I'll up the ante for sure."
1,Last night I made it in to Beckett's Table after hearing so much about it and everyone was spot on.  The space is terrifically laid out very open and well decorated.  We were greeted by the hostess and shown to our table.  Our server came over right away with fresh water and menu's.  So far so good.  \n\nLaura ordered the Salmon which was excellent I am very picky with my fish being from Seattle and I would've ate that whole dish.  The Cous Cous was great and a nice salad on the side to tie it all together.  \n\nI ordered the Pork Osso Buco Confit which my server said was his favorite.  I see why because this pork was fork tender and just falling apart.  I really enjoyed the dish and the roasted veggies were great.  I didn't even know what half of them were and I was still enjoying them all.  \n\nI wish I had room for dessert because they had one I really wanted to try so I will be back for the Chocolate dipped bacon s'mores.  \n\nOverall a great dinning experience and it's close to home so that's even better.
1,It's a great place if you can sit outside in good weather.
0,"The entrance is hard to find/identify... the exit says Sears, but the entrance has a door that says Avis/Budget.  You have to wait in line to bring your car in for service instead of parking in the lot and going into the shop with your keys.  Waiting in line took roughly 20 minutes on a Tuesday about 12 noon.  \n\nI brought my car in for a simple oil change.. it took almost 3 hours.  Granted when they told me it was done, there were several things that Diego had found that I could fix in my car.. the list of repairs totaled over $800.  I didn't bring the car in for an inspection, just an oil change.. that's all I wanted.. could have saved time elsewhere.  It was about $40 for a high mileage oil change including tax and with a discount coupon.\n\nThey assured me that the fluids (windshield washer, power steering, etc.) would be topped off; I checked in the parking lot afterwards and it was not done.  I was so fed-up with waiting so long that I didn't feel the need to wait even more."
0,"Went on a weeknight for dinner and was disappointed by the very slow service that was never explained (maybe this is typical?). I'm pretty patient too but the time it took for a server to take our order almost had me ready to leave. Then took longer to get our meal. Food was good but not amazing. Had a toddler with us and thought the kid menu was ok. It's a minor point but didn't realize that the diet coke I ordered was a single can vs fountain drink w/refills (can't recall the price but it was high). I really wanted to like this but won't be back. Doesn't live up to the hype at least for dinner, won't try to see if breakfast or lunch is better."
0,"i dont even know where to start. THE SERVICE OR THE FOOD!!! OMG, service sucked and the food was disgusting. I walked through the front door and the chef and servers were just staring at me for 2 minutes before i even got greeted with a hello or how may i help you? Then we get seated and it was another 5 minutes before someone came and asked for our drink order. NOT TO MENTION..... this was during SLOW HOURS... it was 4:30pm in the afternoon.... the only customers at the restaurant besides us was another table of 2 sitting 3 tables down from me. We finally got a chance to order after 8-10 minutes. I ordered the chicken satay & green curry with beef and vegetables. The chicken satay lacked flavor and marinate but the peanut dipping sauce that came with it was actually decent... but they only gave you a tablespoon amount for 4 skewers of chicken. The beef green curry arrived and i was disappointed by the flavor. It was watery and it lacked curry flavor... and the veggies weren't even cooked completely. \n....anyways... i wont be coming back. the food was too pricey for the crappy service and poor quality food. I'll rather go to Archi's or Thai noodle house down the street!!"
1,"I knew I'd be down w Owens from the moment i walked in.. guess u could say the writing was on the wall!\n\ni love their super creative selection of bagel and bialy sandwiches.. their food is very good, but the highly likable atmoshpere and great peeps running the join def sealed the 5th star for me.\n\nI got the 'south end' w turkey, tomato, onion, spinach cream cheese on a bialy. yeah its a good as it sounds."
0,"I work near here and for some time I would come here to get a coffee and a sesame bagel with sausage patty. It was a good price and pretty decent.\n\nA year ago I went to order this, and the lady at the cash was struggling to enter the order. Another person came to help out and asked for the order again, which I provided without stress as I was not in a hurry.\n\nThe second woman struggled again and used an extremely derogatory term in arabic which I will not repeat here. I confronted the manager about this for which she apologized.\n\nUpon getting back to work I noticed they had put no milk or sugar in my coffee. I went back to ask for them to add some. They then added so much sugar it was undrinkable.\n\nI have not been going back since. I think using intensely derogatory terms and taking vengeance after on a client is unnaceptable even more so when it's done in front of the manager."
1,I was skeptical at first when I saw the Classic Smashburger in my plate because it did look small for 1/2 lb and not very appetizing but I was wrong. It tastes very good. I enjoyed it very much. The quality of Smash Burger is right there with In & Out down the street... BUT it's pricey. $5.99 for a burger with no fries which are by the way too greasy? That's too bad. I had the Chocolate milk shake and it was delicious. Saying all that I'll go back without hesitation.
1,"We split a bacon cheeseburger, spinach salad, IBC root beer in a frosty cold mug and garlic rosemary fries. It was all good. \n\nThey cut their shoot ring fries right here!!! And even though I'm NOT a fan of rosemary, I must admit these people struck a great balance between potato, garlic, salt and rosemary. I would order them again.\n\nThe burger was good (even though it was well done) and we opted for the Udis gluten free bun and bacon OTS (on the side) next time I'd get the classic with cheese...tomato and lettuce would have been a big help since we all know gluten free bread is always a bit dry.\n\nThe spinach and goat cheese salad w/ grilled chicken was awesome!!! The cheese was fantastic &flavorful. Here's what came in the salad: fresh spinach, diced balsamic tomatoes, raisins, dried cranberries, sunflower and pumpkin seeds, red onion and cucumber. We asked for dressing on the side, but the balsamic from the tomatoes was plenty! The chicken was perfectly cooked through and still moist! A+.\n\nEnjoy and have a great day!"
0,"Used to be a great place with fish tank inside, now it gets worse.\nDoesn't matter what I order.\nMy stomach can't handle it and ruin my fun in Las Vegas.  \nThere are resturants in San Jose and Los Angles are better than this."
0,"Borderline average sushi.  This is a place to see and be seen, but not a serious sushi destination.  Ra is for the status conscious, and I don't quite understand why as it is not particularly trendy, fancy or special."
1,"Fabulous Italian food, and wonderful Old Vegas ambience.  All had chicken dishes and no one was disappointed.. Impeccable service - the bread was to die for. We were staying nearby and decided to go here because my husband's daughter, who lives in LV, had heard it was good. It was amazing....and packed by 7 pm on a weeknight.  We had made a reservation."
1,I love this place! They are always very friendly & welcoming.
0,"I wanted to give this place a one start but because the food was not bad,  I am giving it two. The bad part part was the service,  simply horrible. The table was not well cleaned,  the waiter got an attitude and ignorant. I am not sure if I will go back."
0,"Let me start this review by saying that there is a lot of really cool stuff in this store. The small store in Downtown Container park is stocked with gorgeous original artwork of pretty much any Disney character you can think of. They also have some really cute figurines and other collectables. If you are a Disney fan, this place really is a must stop. And if you have some money to burn, you might find yourself taking something home.\n\nIf you can physically take it home, that is. If you are visiting Las Vegas on vacation, as people are known to do from time to time, and want them to ship a purchase home to you well ... not so much. And here in lies the reason behind me giving out a VERY rare one-star review.\n\nAs I was exploring DTCP, I decided to stop in the Disney Fine Art store to look around. It was the day before Valentine's Day, and I thought I might find something here for my wife, who is a huge Disney fan. Most of the store is filled with really cool original paintings ... they're not cheap, but they have some fantastic pieces. I didn't see anything that I felt confident my wife would like, so I was hesitant to pull the trigger on an expensive piece of artwork. But I noticed these cute figurines in the back. They had one that was Kermit and Miss Piggy dining together ... my wife LOVES the Muppets, especially Kermit, so I thought this would be a perfect gift, and was entirely affordable and reasonable at $25. I asked the attendant working if they could ship it to me and she noted that it came in a box that would keep it safe. But I was doing carry-on only and was already tight on space, and I didn't want to risk it being broken, so I paid an extra $8 to have it delivered. I gave them my home address, paid with my credit card, and got a crappy handwritten receipt, plus an e-receipt via Square. \n\nAfter a couple of weeks went by I never received either a package, nor a message from the store stating that the package was shipped, with a tracking number provided. I called the store and got a guy who was very nice and apologetic and took my information, said he would look into it, and would call me back immediately with a status update. \n\nA couple of weeks pass again, and I've heard nothing. I don't have time to track down things I've already paid for and figure out why they haven't been shipped to me yet, so I wrote it off as a lost cause. But I figured I'd give them another chance. I called again and spoke to a lady who said she was the new store manager and that they had been busy planning a new store opening, and she was just gaining an understanding of what had been done there, etc. I didn't need to hear her story, but she sounded sincere, apologetic, and seemed like someone who had their stuff together. Finally, I thought, I'll be able to get this really cool gift that my wife would LOVE and that I have paid for delivered to me. The lady found my information on file, apologized for it \""slipping through the cracks\"" and would contact me back by close of business with a tracking number.\n\nSo guess what happened next? If you guessed nothing ... DING DING DING, you're today's big winner. I waited about 5 days, heard nothing, and filed a dispute for a refund through my credit card company. \n\nAgain, let me stress that the merchandise they sell here is fantastic - some really cool stuff. If you live in the Las Vegas area and can buy and take the merchandise home that day - and afford it - you will be happy. But if they can't ship a product I bought onsite, and paid to have shipped, within a month then they should think about making their one store function properly before opening others."
1,"YUM!\n\nSquash blossom hushpuppies followed by warm kale, fried goat cheese and beet salad, and a house made white bean burger with potaoes on the side.  Delish!  Loved sitting outside on the cute but small patio-- great people watching!  Love the cucumber water.\n\nThe veggie burger, while delicious, was way too big to eat as a burger.  The dipping sauce for the squash blossom hushpuppies was a bit disappointing.\n\nService was great.  Patio is cute; interior is small but quaint."
1,"I just purchased my gown at Uptown Bridal today and couldn't be happier with my experience working with Diane. Here are some of the ways my experience here stood out from the rest of the stores:\n\nI sat down with Diane to talk about the feel of my wedding and likes and dislikes and, unlike some of the other salons that I visited, I believe she really understood my taste based upon the selection of gowns that she pulled.\n\nI received one-on-one attention from her the entire time. In fact, there was never more than one other customer in the shop at the same time. They provide a slip and accessories and help you into each gown (one shop had me dress myself).\n\nFor a small boutique, the gown selection is diverse including gowns that others didn't carry. There were more than enough gowns to suite my niche taste. \n\nThe cost of the gowns are very reasonable. I was able to get a lux and sophisticated gown within my budget. (It makes me wonder how David's Bridal can stay in business asking similar prices for poor material and used-car style sales environment.)\n \nMost importantly, I was never pressured into anything--gowns or immediate purchase. In fact, they suggested that I take some time to think about it and not rush into any decision.\n\nI would recommend Uptown Bridal to anyone that appreciates quality craftsmanship  and unique details in a gown and genuine customer service."
1,"The food here is served in huge portions. It's also good, but greasy. The hot dogs taste really good and the chili cheese fries are good because of the cheese sauce used instead of shredded cheese. It's a good place to eat if you're on the strip and want something not pretentious. It's all normal fast food with huge portions and tastes good."
0,DO NOT COME HERE. This was the WORST food I've EVER had in Vegas and I've lived here for 19 years. I literally almost vomited and requested a refund through Eat24 because I sure as hell wasn't going back there!
0,"The quick and dirty review: Pizza is about average. Wings are ok. The place feels a little dated, though, or they need to do something about their tvs. Dark and hard to see for a sports bar. Service stinks. Lots of better choices nearby.\n\nI was in Dec 28th to watch the fight. I have to say when I come in I usually don't expect a lot. Little food, little drink, decent service. This particular night the service was all around bad. Waitress was unhappy, unfriendly and completely inattentive in keeping drinks full. After waiting for what felt like an eternity, decided to go to the bar myself to get filled. Service there was slow and unpleasant there as well.  Makes me not ever want to set foot here again. I get the impression the girls are far more worried about their gobs of smoky eye makeup and chit chatting than earning their tip by providing service. Sorry, heavily spackled makeup and huge hair aren't cuttin it. Try putting more effort into actually serving diners.  The average food did nothing to improve my opinion on the night. Not even a thank you for coming in.\n\nBased on terrible service alone I'd give it a zero. Yelp makes me give a 1 star minimum, so here's an undeserved star."
0,"As the rating says...meh. I've experienced better.\n\nThe environment isn't exactly the best as it seems a bit run down. I feel like I should eat very fast and get out of there, since it's just that bad.\n\nThe food is also meh...coming from Markham, almost every single Chinese restaurant I go to there beat this place any day.\n\nPrice-wise it's good though, so are the servers. Otherwise...pass."
1,"We have eaten at the restaurant several times as we enjoy the food and last night brought friends (another couple) as it was one of their birthdays.  In the afternoon called and spoke with a hostess to tell her would like \""happy birthday\"" written on the plate on whatever dessert was ordered.  When we arrived at the restaurant ran in ahead and mentioned it to the hostess (different than the one spoke with on the phone).  When we did in fact order dessert there was no acknowledgement of a birthday with either a candle or writing on the plate.  It was a very slow evening so no excuse about being busy but just that the messages were not relayed to the waiter (who was very good by the way and not his fault).  This was disappointing as we wanted to finish off the evening with that surprise.  Called the manager this morning who apologized but absolutely no offer of a gift card for a dessert that could make this up to my friend.  That was not good business."
0,"Thank goodness for good company! Though the service was great... the rest was.. not so much. First strike: the filthiest wine glass I have ever seen. And I normally don't pay attention to such things.. good thing I did!! Secondly, the ginger dressing was quite odd. Not what Im used to, and very 'mayonaise-y' (creamy).  And while the rolls were quite good, nothing stood out as fantastic about them. The tempura flakes on one of our rolls were definitely stale.  (unless chewy tempura flakes are the new thing...?) next time I'm in the Queen City, I will skip Room 112. Sorry (as for the filthy wine glass, it was replaced even after the wine was poured in... the bottle was replaced as well)."
1,"You can find this restaurant in a food court right next to CSN Charleston. I wanted to give this place out a try after the owner put their weekly special: Bourbon BBQ Pulled Pork Sandwich with onion rings and soda/water for $8. Pretty good deal if you ask me! The food took awhile but that's because it was made to order, plus the wait was well worth it if you ask me! \n\nThis is definitely THE BEST Bourbon BBQ sandwich I've ever had! It was so juicy and tender. It wasn't hard to chew. And it was exceptionally flavorful! It was very delicious! The onion rings were perfect as well. It wasn't disgustingly oily or anything. I also tried the triple chocolate brownie.. BEST brownie I've ever tasted. I'm the biggest chocolate lover, and this is definitely my FAVORITE brownie! \n\nI would definitely recommend others to give this place a try! It's a new menu with new food! You won't be disappointed!"
0,Service wasn't great. Food was mediocre. Not impressed so I probably wouldn't return.
1,"This is one of my favorite places to eat in the valley! Delicious food, comfortable atmosphere and late hours (serve food until midnight except for Sundays) is the reason my girlfriend and I frequent Cornish Pasty Co. The different kinds of pasties they offer are VERY diverse (anything from exotic flavors like the \""red curry chicken\"" and \""lamb and mint\"" to traditional flavors like \""italian\"" and \""reuben\""). Of the 38+ flavors they offer, I have probably tried about 10 of them and haven't found one I didn't LOVE! I live 40 miles away form this location but never do I mind the drive, it's always worth it! I recommend the Carne Adovada and the Hibiscus tea is my favorite!"
0,"Salesman, installation team and lock tech, excellent.  Extremely poor management and organization. \n\nAttended a home show here in Las Vegas. Met two windows and doors people and invited them to our home for a plan and estimate.  Mike from Hy-bar Windows and Doors gave us the option we wanted in a three-paneled french doors. We selected the hardware (2 nickel handles and plates) and were told it would be 6-8 weeks for installation. We paid the fifty percent deposit. After 9 weeks I called to talk to Mike, but told he left the company. (In hindsight, I don't blame him!) I asked about the order, and the owner Russ didn't know anything about it. He said maybe the order was dropped.  I said, \""Our deposit was \""dropped\"" right into your bank account!\"" \n\nI advised the owner that we were having Sunburst Shutters put 4 1/2 inch shutters on the doors and would need to have door handle extensions to accommodate the shutters, delivered at the same time as the doors. \n\nRuss Barlow called when he located the order, and I was hoping we wouldn't have to wait another long stretch. He advised he would push it through.  Almost 3 months to the day the order was placed, did the doors arrive - minus one extension! LIVID!\n\nSubsequently could not lock doors from the inside and could, only if the key was left-in on the outside??? Locksmith came late, worked an hour into the time the salesman for Sunburst came. Sunburst left and went on another call and returned later for the measurements.\n\nThe locksmith happened to have the same extension on his truck and installed it.  COOL! He attempted to collect for the extensions.  I said I was not paying and to take it up with the owner or have the owner call me. I never heard anything more.\n\n4 months later someone from the office called to say the extensions were in.  WHAT??? You mean to say they expected us to wait for this small piece for 4 months and that was cool with them? Shoddy business at best, but the young man calling had no idea what transpired months before!\n\nSad though, because Hybar had the windows I wanted.  In the end, we went with another company to replace 21 windows.\n\nThough we love the french doors, we will not, could not, ever recommend Hy-bar Windows and Doors to our worst enemies, if we had any!"
0,"It's almost comical. Tried Thrive again. Got the Strawberry Passion. In the menu description it says that it's topped with granola, pineapple, honey and strawberries (plural). \n\nI'll attach a picture of what I got. It has to be less than one strawberry. I'm just constantly disappointed. Cmon...you're right next to Sprouts. Surely you can hook up some kind of deal!"
0,"I wanted to like this place so badly, and I was actually thinking of giving it a second chance before writing this review. But the more I thought about it, the more I realized that I do not want to come here again.\n\nFirst of all, I've never eaten Taiwanese food before and I didn't really know what to order off their very extensive menu.  The first waitress couldn't help us bc she didn't speak English.  The second waitress was just generally unhlepful in making recommendations or explaining what the different dishes were.\n\nWe ended up ordered a squid and vegetable dish and a kung pao chicken dish.  They took SOOOOO long to come out!  After 20 minutes of waiting we find out that there is a problem with the rice cooker sothat's why everything is taking so long.  Finally, after 30+ minutes the squid dish comes out.  The \""vegetables\"" in the dish were JUST cabbage.  And the squid was just the frozen, pre-cut kind that you can buy at the store.\n\nThe kung pao chicken was slightly better and in a very flavorful, savory sauce.  But the rice was still soggy when it came out, even though it took 45 minutes for us to get it.\n\nso yeah, I wanted to like this place and I always root for independent small business owners, but this place was just not good enough to warrant a second visit."
0,"Don't come here for parts, they charge 2x as much, try the Internet, you save money in the long run. Supposed to be zero star but I have to put one to post  my review."
0,"Eh... I expected a lot better from what I've heard and after an hour wait...( I've been to the one in Asheville- and it's just not the same). I will say service was friendly (but slow), but the food just wasn't good.\nBrunch:\nI ordered a crab and egg dish- and after it took about 50 minutes to come out, it just wasn't good. It lacked flavor and spices, and was definitely not worth the $14. My husband got a meat pie after the server recommended it- also, not very impressive and not a lot of meat in it. \nAfter we were asked how the food was, we told our server that we weren't very happy with it, the manager came over and apologized and gave us a gift card to try again. At least they care... \nToo bad the food wasn't good..."
1,"Since Mr. K's excellent review, Underwraps has made a few changes. (Hey! Maybe they read your review?) You can now order salads (five types from Asian or Greek to Caesar or Cobb) and the sides to chose from include potato chips (which ROCK and are made in-house), potato salad or pasta salad (they scratched the fries). \n\nThe grilled vegetable wrap IS tasty: kalamata olives, grilled squash, roasted green peppers, red onion, lemon vinaigrette, but I also really like to do the scrambled egg (crispy bacon, caramelized onion, tomato and melted provolone cheese). They even make it egg whites only for me!\n\nI do think a lot of their business is catering... and they've got some good offers. You can serve 11-14 people assorted wraps for just $50! \n\nThis place is close to where I work and it's not generally too crowded, so it's easy enough to get in and out. I'm gonna round up and give it four stars for taste and convenience!"
1,Hostesses were great and were seated right away.  The sushi was very fresh and the show was one of the best I have seen.  If you are in the area and want some good hibachi come to Yokoso!
0,"Extremely poor. \n\nTiny (& I mean minuscule) portions and served up cold and poorly presented...and clearly aged & frozen produce used to add insult to injury.\n\nThis is the third time I've eaten at Bluerapa over the past year and each time it's been worse than the previous. \n\nAfter this episode I spoke to the manageress and was offered a 50% off next time, but to be honest I was so appalled by this experience that that's us done with this place. \n\nOverpriced and under delivered."
0,"We went here for lunch on a Saturday.  The banner out front said they were under new management, but I have to agree with Mary L. in that we'll go to the 5 and Diner at Arrowhead before we'll go back to this location.  My veggie sandwich had one enormous piece of cucumber (not thin slices that would actually make sense in a sandwich), but was otherwise what I expected.  Nothing fancy, just veggies and cheese on bread.  My daughter's grilled cheese was better, but her fruit cup was a little weird.  None of the ice cream, fountain, or dessert choices were in the menu we wer given and our server didn't know what wet fries were.  My husband's cheeseburger was fine, but nothing to get excited about.\n\nI didn't see a jukebox and the wait staff all wore jeans and T-shirts.  How is that \""Delux\""?  Maybe it's that they serve beer and have a TV with football on?  I have no idea.  Regardless, we won't be back."
0,"Employees are nice, but prices are double any other Starbucks that I've ever been to. The also don't have a Starbucks card scanner. If you're going to charge crazy prices at least have good technology. Last time I get Starbucks at Aria.\n\n*after coming back the next day it appears they double charged me, but I'll never know since they didn't give me a receipt."
0,"This is more of a general review of the chain itself, having eaten at two separate P.F. Chang's chain restaurants. \n\nI think the food is so average that the prices are bizarre. Actually, some of it is below average, because it is so darn salty. I was with four other people, and we all ate the beef and broccoli, and it was so salty that we had to complain even though we didn't want to. The waitress insisted that that's how they normally make it and that we would have to inform them next time if we want it less salty. So, the waitress gave a newly cooked and less salty plate of beef and broccoli. You could barely taste the flavoring of all the dishes. I have had the kung pao shrimp twice, and it lacked any kind of spiciness. Not even a hint. The kung pao shrimp was also salty, as well as the sweet and sour soup. We did the dinner for two and for the amount of meat they give, the amount of rice is lacking. \n\nI guess the pricey has to do with the high end appearance and up keep of the restaurant itself. It is nice and the servers are nice, but I definitely would not go there again. It's overrated and expensive."
0,I was so very disappointed!!!  This is not even close to the Al's Beef on Taylor street.  The beef tastes old and the fries are limp and soggy.  The decor is nice but no counter space to put your tray while you get ketchup.  Not that I will ever be coming back!
0,"Tony B review on 11/27/10 states he had a hair on his fruit.  The EXACT same thing happened to me.  \n\nYou don't get very much food for the price, but what you get tastes good.  If it was a little cheaper and I had not gotten hairy fruit I might have gone 3 stars on this.  I will go back but this is not one of those places that I would rave about."
0,"Terrible. We booked a stay in a hotel online, and on the reservation form online there was a box you could check to reserve a shuttle for an additional cost. I thought, why not? It'll be more convenient than taking a cab. Wrong. \n\nWhen we got to the airport, it was complete disarray. There were two shuttles, which I was first told were going to different places by the person in the ticket box, and then was told were going to the same places by a person on the street. The wait times quoted were long and wrong. I had to ask several staff members, both on the street and in the box, how long it would be and which shuttle we should be on. The responses trended toward unfriendly, and were largely unhelpful. Total wait was around 25 minutes for shuttle. \n\nWhen calling to book our return shuttle, they said they had to pick us up at 5:15 am (!) to get us to the airport in time for our 8:30 am flight, and that we shouldn't try calling the company to ask where our shuttle was unless it had been more than 15 minutes late (!). We could have quite literally walked to the airport quicker than that. And to top it off, when we called to cancel since we decided to sleep in another hour and a half and just take a cab, they didn't even have our reservation for the morning of our departure. No sign of it. NOW I understood why they allowed themselves several hours to screw things up and attempt to fix them in the morning. Things like this must happen all of the time. \n\nOur cab driver to the airport, I must say, was a gentleman, and the cost was less than the shuttle - and we left 15 minutes before we had to be there and arrived promptly! \n\nThe only upside to the Showtime shuttle was the driver we ended up with, who was helpful, hilarious, and very friendly. The first driver that was waiting at the curb certainly wasn't, so I'm glad I ended up with her otherwise I'd have been even more irked by my Showtime experience. \n\nTo sum: if you're only in Vegas for a short trip, like we were, save yourselves the time, money, and hassle and get a cab (or other alternative). Eek."
0,"Seriously? I cannot believe this has as many stars as it does. I have eaten at a lot of nice restaurants in Chicago, LA, San Diego, Chicago, and other major cities, and this place was not up to par on any level except the view.\n\nFirst of all, the service was slow. I definitely understand if a restaurant is busy, but when your food comes out cold and the waiter doesn't check on you for long periods of time, that is an issue.\n\nSecondly, the food was mediocre at best. If I am paying a lot of money per person, I expect at least a decent meal. Personally, I would have been more satisfied with a meal from a restaurant half the price.\n\nThe portion sizes were good, and the wine was delicious. The view was also amazing! However, it became very dark in the restaurant when the sun went down (this may be to make the view outside better).\n\nI would not go back to this restaurant, but if you are looking for a great view, I would recommend going for wine and dessert. Do not waste your time on  the food."
1,"Adobo fried rice omelette..nuff said...really though, they have Filipino and Japanese dishes and we always have to start here when we visit the LV...YOu must try if you're in the area..."
1,"Best Korean I've had yet in Vegas. The Dumpling Tofu soup was divine. I asked for spicy and got it! The food arrived sizzling to the table. I love every single side they give complimentary. You can really fill up for $10. a person. The Short Ribs were the bomb! The staff is wonderful. I love the ambiance and decor, everything, even the simple wooden chairs. There's two sides to Tofu Hut, the BBQ table and regular. The late hours are a plus! I will come back frequently, now that I know of this gem. I will bring friends. I'm gonna try the BBQ next time."
0,"Thank goodness I don't have a car anymore and don't have to deal with these clowns.\n\nBack when I moved into PGH, I did have a car, and obtained the residential permit necessary to park in my neighborhood (N. Oakland).  Go figure, when I went to the office to do so, the meter I first tried to park at was broken, and wouldn't accept any of my quarters.  (This is back in the day when the old meters still existed.)  I should have recognized this as a metaphor for PPA's dysfunctionality.  As it were, I just reported it to them.\n\nAs anyone who's ever been to N. Oakland knows, parking there is a real PITA, and the street that my apt. bldg.'s on doesn't even have parking.  One day about two weeks later, after parking in one of my normal spots, I went to my car only to see a ticket on the windshield.  \""What the heck?\"" I thought, since I had my residential permit prominently displayed.  Turns out I was parked within twenty feet of a crosswalk.  I wasn't aware this rule even existed, but apparently, it does.  Way to welcome me to the neighborhood, PGH!\n\nSince I was new to town and I'd heard that PGH parking court is a joke, I decided to contest the ticket.  It took me three calls to even get someone to answer the phone to sign up for a court date, since you couldn't schedule one yourself through their website.  I scheduled my hearing for an evening session about a month later.\n\nBefore I was ever able to go to court, a flood happened and totaled my car, making me even angrier about the situation.  I went to court with the plan of asking for leniency, given that I was new to town and newly carless.  When it was my turn, I took one look at the judge (a portly and stern-looking elderly woman) and knew I wasn't going to get off.  I didn't even get to finish my sob story before she cut me off.  \""It isn't our fault you didn't know the rules and that your car's wrecked,\"" she said.  Good thing I had enough cash on me to pay the fine, since I don't think they even took credit cards.\n\nDon't believe the stories about PGH parking court judges taking pity on you because you took time out of your day to show up and contest a ticket, regardless of the reason for it.  That court is a kangaroo court and they're out to do one thing--make money.  Be aware of the more obscure laws, which include not only parking too close to crosswalks, but also head-in parking only.  Check the parking signs carefully, feed the meters, and observe the time limits, and hopefully, you won't have the misfortune of dealing with these idiots.  You've been warned.\n\nI won't even get into the exorbitance of their rates downtown and in Oakland...  Their slogan, \""The Value Parking Network,\"" is laughable and downright disingenuous."
1,PNC Park is a picturesque dollhouse of a ballpark. Great venue to unwind after work in or a business trip to Pittsburgh. Sit on the third baseline for a surrealistically close vista of cityscape.
0,"This place got really good reviews so we decided to give it a try.  I don't know if we just ordered the wrong stuff or the sushi chef was having a bad day or what but I really didn't think their rolls were all that good.  We ordered a few rolls from their happy hour menu: Philadelphia, crunch, California and some sort of shrimp/avocado roll.  The rice was dry and had no flavor!  I think they forgot the vinegar!  \n\nWe also ordered the following:\n\nEdamame: I've never seen so many of the beans out of its pod!  It tasted about par with other places though.\n\nGyoza: I always thought they were different (but similar) to Chinese dumplings but here, it was EXACTLY like a Chinese dumpling.  Tasted OK.\n\nVeggie fried rice: They used really sticky (I'm assuming sushi) rice to make it.  I wouldn't mind it so much if I wanted sticky rice but we ordered fried rice ... usually the rice is a lot looser.\n\nMiso soup: really bland and I am one who usually prefers bland food.\n\nSeaweed salad: By far my favorite.  At other places it's usually a huge salad entr\u00e9e so it was nice they had a small side of it I could order.  Great flavor.  Perfection.\n\nI would at least give this place a try again.  I just can't imagine this place getting such good reviews but the sushi tasting the way it did.  I can only assume it was an off day.  The service was good though and they have booth seats which is always a plus when you  have a toddler!\n\nOn the (far) West side, my barometer for good sushi is usually comparing the new place I try to Tomo's off of Dysart/McDowell, the Japanese food restaurant we frequent most."
1,"Found this place about 15 years ago.  You guessed right....a referral.  Been referring and using ever since.  This is a no nonsense - CUSTOMER SERVICE oriented family business.  The staff is the same since the original trip.  \n\nIf you are looking for fair pricing, personal service and no \""extra\"" suggested  upselling, this is a great place for you.  Wouldnt even think of taking my vehicles anywhere else.  Special thanks to this staff that goes out of their way for the little things too."
0,"Don't know what all the rave reviews are for. Had fish tacos today for lunch and they were bland - like having fish & chips on a tortilla, except the fish in real fish & chips is better. Also had soup - chicken & jalapeno; also boring, though better when we added some of the corn relish and some bottled hot sauce. Everything needed salt - and more flavor.\n\nAnd what's up with no salsa on the table, just a corn & tomato relish? Which was mostly corn.\n\nMy fish tacos are way better! Can't believe Guy Fieri liked this place - he usually has better taste.\nWon't go there again."
1,"Great wine and great customer service!\nWe were in Scottsdale for my friend's bachelorette party, and we did the \""bottling party\"" at Su Vino.  We had a big table that sat all 8 of us, with cheese, fruit and crackers, and our own personal wine maker bringing us tastes and explaining the different wines.  Then we were able to bottle our own wine, and put our own label on it (we had a picture of all of us girls).\nIt was a blast!  I would definitely recommend a visit here!"
1,"Came here because I heard so many great things about it, from tourists to locals.  Damn! am I happy I came.\n\n#1 Prime Rib - Wait for a fresh one and get the end cut.  You will not be disappointed.  Tasted so damn good that I didn't even want au jois or A1 or Tabasco.  I didn't want to spoil the taste with other sauces, even if they help enhance it. Best Prime rib I have ever eaten, melts in your mother fucking mouth! *WARNING*  Do not, I repeat Do NOT, start with this dish first, it will ruin everything else in the buffet for you because it is so damn good.  By the end of my meal I went back for seconds.\n\n#2 Mac and Cheese One of the best Mac and Cheeses I have ever tasted.  Enough said.\n\n#3 Maybe the Green Sauce and Pork in the Mexican section, this was pretty good, soft pieces of pork.\n\nOther dishes that stood out was the sweet mashed potatos with marshmallows, Clams, Mussels, and Tempura Shrimp.\n \nEverything else was so-so.  Even so it is still one of the buffets you must hit up.  I'm not sure if it is the best in Vegas, but I was not disappointed.\n\nThe deserts:  Chocolate Rice Krispies and Gelato.  The Ice Cream was great.\n\n$26 a person on a Weekday, free Wine and Beer.\n\nBy the end of the meal I was so full I wanted to throw up.  We went for a feast and left more than satisfied.\n\nThe only complaint I have is that it is far away.  Other than that, everyone that comes to Vegas must go at least once in their life."
0,"I do not know what is going on with this place but I've had two recent bad experiences with the walk-up  the window service.  Yes, two, I don't learn very quickly.   I've ordered ice cream from the window twice while walking on the Vegas Strip.  The first time I waited over 20 minutes to order.  No big deal since I was just people watching and enjoying the weather.  After another 15 minutes of waiting at window #2 a delicious ice cream appeared.  I will give them credit for a yummy ice cream sundae.\n\nRound two was the same routine of waiting with a crowd that was becoming restless and angry for over 30 minutes.  This time when my ice cream sundae finally appeared it had the wrong flavor ice cream.  I had ordered vanilla and it was chocolate.  No biggie, who doesn't like chocolate?  Then I discovered it was all melted and ruined.  Threw it in the trash (after eating the whipped cream off of course).  No way I could have gotten through the angry mob to ask for a replacement.  The price of a sundae is $10.00.  Geez, I'm a sucker right?  I plan to write Caesar's Palace and ask for a $10.00 credit.  I love the Qua Waters Spa and I think that's where I would use the credit.  Wish me luck!"
0,"Aria hotel is great, but........\n\nwent to Jean Georges with 11 of my closest friends... the food was good and the service absolutely sucked... the worst service I have gotten from any restaurant ever... It started bad by having to ask the waitress for drinks and went downhill from there... even speaking with the manager 2X didn't improve things much... and bill time... bill wrong and took 3 more wrong bills and an hour to get out of there... will return to the Aria but Jean Georges will never be seeing me again..."
0,"The food is great the service sucks never met ruder people in my life, and they over charged paid $30.00 a salad and didn't want to deal with it!"
0,"Tooooo disappointed..... I was want to give three Starnes it was not that bad but there are many five star and I really want ppl know what's going on now...\nWhen they grand opening, was $23/person. It was so good!!! Nice steak, salmon, crap, also outstanding desert ..... Around two years after, I went it again, as it was my #1 choice. $35 (around) per person. No more salmon available but smoked salmon.... It still ok, as it has great desert..... \nOk.... I went there last Saturday for $44 with tax per person with my friend, who never been to Vegas . He asked me why u love this buffet ad it's below average..... I would rather find a hold.... There only a smoked salmon Pizza... Poor quality steak and desert was not like before... There is no point I should go back there! Very disappointed me! It's not only I pay over 40 for a dinner, it was like destroy my dream.... I will never go to any buffet at Vegas... The $20 buffet at Rowland heights is better than this! \nI have question for the management, why you do this? Because you have pretty good rate at yelp? You are destroying yourself!"
0,"Not a fan of this place after overhearing the owner wants to put eb's and t-street out of business. Do what you do, but don't strive to bring others down. Bad vibes, and i really wanted to like this place. Try heist brewery if you want somewhere new. I will NOT be giving PR or jackalopes any more of my business :("
1,"This is clearly one of my favorite restaurants in Montreal. Ive been here twice. Once for my birthday and I took some clients for dinner. The atmosphere is lively and the food is simply amazing. Being that Ive gone twice and at diffferent times, my experiece was different, but nonetheless the food was great. If you must try a drink, please try the Tokyo Express. As an Entree I had the Flank Steak and Spicy Butter and it was cooked to perfection. On a busy night the service can be a bit slow, but with good company its worth the wait."
1,"I went here for the first time with my wife yesterday having expectations that this was going to be similar to a Black Angus or Outback. We got there at about 7:30PM, which seemed like the tail end of their dinner rush. I could see several open tables, but was told that it was going to be a 25 minute wait. Normally I would have walked away then but my wife really wanted a steak and options in Surprise are limited.\n\nDespite the open tables we waited about 20 minutes to be seated. After sitting down, we waited around for another 15 minutes to get our drink orders in and another 10 minutes after that to actually get our drinks and bread. Service was very slow.\n\nOur server was friendly and helpful, but it was obvious that she was overwhelmed with the number of tables assigned to her, which is probably a management issue.\n\nWhile waiting for our food I checked the restaurant out and it was very clean (I would hope that it would be because the building is less than a year old). The only place that seemed to need some attention was the restroom. It looked like it had been hit by a dinner rush crowd and was is need of a cleaning.\n\nWhen our food arrived it looked very appetizing. My wife order the filet mignon and I had the parmesan crusted chicken breast. We both ordered the baked potato as a side with a side salad to start. I thought that all the food was great and worth the wait.\n\nThe filet mignon was very tender and prepared perfectly. The chicken was good but I wish I had ordered the steak after tasting my wife's. The salad was fresh and the baked potato was good. In all the food was very good.\n\nThis places food is great, but the service isn't. If I'm going to shell out $90 for two dinners, one appetizer, and four adult beverages I would hope for much better service.\n\nThis could be a five star spot if not for the service."
0,"Sadly, in its many years on the Corstorphine high street, Heaven looks to have slipped down in quality and professionalism. \n\nFirstly, the prices are steep. And this would be fine if the salon had a quality feel to it. But the treatment rooms are very small, the place needs a lick of paint and looks quite tired, and it's not very tidy. The shower also needed a scrub and rooms were really cluttered and tight. I had nowhere to put my clothes so just had to dump them under the treatment bed.\n\nI was pretty disgusted to see that the treatment bed had a dirty plastic covering on it that I was meant to sit on, complete with used wax from another treatment. Eww!  The salon could do well to bin that idea and go with the disposable roll that every other place I've ever been to has. Icksville on the plastic sheeting!\n\nThe girl that did my legs did an ok job, but when she moved onto eyebrows they were the worst shape I have ever seen. She left them looking like two hairy slugs and told me she shaped them that way because I \""wasn't used to a more defined shape\"". Err, excuse me?! I had to pluck in the shape myself when I got home a whole \u00a335 lighter on the cash front and still plenty heavy on the ol' eyebrow hair front.\n\nThere are better salons in the area and I'll only be back here as a last resort. Shame, as Heaven used to be the \""go to\"" place for me and my friends in the local area. Think they need to up their game a bit to be honest..."
1,Love this bbq place and love that it's local.  Sometimes you can smell the meat cooking as you drive by.  The carne asada is really good and it's nice to be able to use Open Table for reservations.  Nice atmosphere and some really good grill.
1,"Farmer Glenn is the coolest farmer in Las Vegas (He also is a Farmer's Insurance agent on the side lol www.farmersagent.com/glinsenbardt.  All you have to do is try their eggs once and you'll never want to eat store bought eggs again.  They have become so popular, they are selling out early on Saturdays and Sundays now so get there early (Open at 9 AM).  Their new website is fantastic   http://thelasvegasfarm.com/  and my kids love seeing all of the animals.  If you are not there just for the produce or eggs, the entrance fee is $2 for adults and $1 for kids to tour the huge property and see the 450 animals or so that they have."
1,"We stayed here overnight while passing thru on our way to our final destination for vacation. Booked it on line based on the reviews and rates we found at various sites. We weren't disappointed. It was very convenient to get to/from the airport and just a quick drive to the strip. Staff was great, especially Chuck, and got us checked in early so we didn't have to carry our luggage around with us all day. \n\nWe used the exercise room, pool and free breakfast and weren't disappointed with any of them. They aren't anything fancy, but all were clean and were what you would expect to find at a hotel like this. Also can't complain for the rate to stay here. Could hear planes while swimming in the pool but never heard them in our room on 2nd floor.\n\nPlanning to stay again on our stop thru Vegas on our way back home. Also plan to try out the free shuttle to the airport next time.\n\nDefinitely worth the money for a clean, safe hotel near the airport and not that far from the strip."
0,"Will never eat here again. Here's why...\nOrdered a plate with grilled pork, grilled beef and rice. From the moment the plate was put down in front of me, someting smelled rotten. It was the beef, the beef was very past date. I was hungry and it was late, so i took the beef out of my plate and ate what i deemed to be edible. Server came by, i told her the beef i was served was rancid, she did not seem to understand, and took off minus the rancid beef. \nI go to pay, i tell the gentleman at the cash that i was served rancid beef. blank stare. I repeat the same thing in french...blank stare. I asked him if there was anyone here who spoke either french or english. A woman comes out of the kitchen, she con erses with the man for 5 minutes, the woman tells me that she will give me 50% off my next visit!? Ok, like i will ever come back to a restaurant that served me rancid beef, i told them they might want reduce the price of my dish seeing as how a portion of it was rancid. They babbled on for a few minutes, they seemed very reluctant to give me any sort of discount, out of frustration i paid FULL price and left. With all the great restaurants in Verdun, don't even bother with this place."
1,"So...since I first ate fresh brick oven mushroom and onion pizza with my Daddy in a little dive on Peachtree St. in Atlanta in 1972, I have had this thing for pizza.  (Yes, I had eaten it also at the only Italian restaurant in our area - Gargano's - it was good, but not like that one!!!) I love it.  No other way to put it.  So, when we find a place we like, we don't want to change.  Well...we had our favorite NY style pizza in the town we left in Cali last year - Rocky's - and had no hopes of finding a place with the same home-town, delicious vibe.  BUT, we did!!  At FloriDino's in Gilbert.  We come back here at least once a month, and I even tried lunch  - good deal, too.  I'll just break it down quickly:\n\n1. The prices are quite reasonable, especially considering....(keep reading...)\n2. The portions are incredible.  We share...everything!\n3.  Pizza Muffins were invented by a genius and man, oh, man - they are good fresh,  \n     leftover, 5 days old...whenever.\n4.  The bread sticks/cheese sticks are quite yummy.\n5.  The calzones are ginormous and delicious beyond the imagination - especially \n     the White Calzones.  Oh heavens!!\n6.  The pizzas are excellent - any way you like them.\n7.  They make a decent Caesar - big enough to share.\n8.  Tiramisu was huge and delicious and the cheesecake was good, too.\n9.  The service is great, the staff is friendly and attentive, and the atmosphere \n     congenial.\n10.  Family style seating, bar seating, cozy booths and table seating.\n11.  ENJOY!!!"
1,"I left my office building to go grab standard lunch fare at some restaurant, but never made it to my car as I noticed a mob of people huddled around a blue truck. BEST grilled cheese sandwich. I hope they come back soon. What a treat! Amazing food and friendly service."
1,"I always find it hard to find decent breakfast places. I recently had a business meeting at Cracker Barrel and was happy with y experience. They have a large breakfast menu so there is something for everyone. Their little store also has some unique gifts, which are perfect for stocking stuffers.\n\nBring a big appetite for here!"
1,"Oh my lord- East coast Jewish delis are amazing, and this place can holds its own with the best of them. As soon as I saw the menu here, I started (favorably) comparing it to Miller's on Polk Street in SF, where I first had matzo ball soup.\n\nThe soup here, which we started with, is just as legit. And the portions are just as huge, too- the one pictured is a cup. It could easily be a lunch, and is served with a couple of tasty-ass bagel chips too. Rye flavor, natch.\n\nBF opted for one of the most expensive (and largest) sandwiches ever, the JR Boucher, which is a triple-layer with pastrami and liver. Yeah, that didn't sound tasty to me at all, and it's $18. But we got it, and it's frickin' delicious: all the components work so well together, they harmonize like a choir of angels. Oh and one sandwich is easily like three meals. We shared it and still had half for dinner.\n\nAnd, because I'm a total glutton and never on this side of town, I had to get my own dish, too. I got the Ceily's stack- latkes stuffed with brisket, topped with two types of cheese and brown gravy. It's even more amazing than it sounds, priced at $12, and is also easily split into thirds. Just finished my order for lunch today.\n\nWith two heavy take-out boxes in hand, we rolled ourselves out the door... And promptly axed any plans of looking for a rental property in Henderson, because I don't want to weigh 400 pounds and if this place were nearby, that might be a serious possibility."
0,This place is not there anymore.
1,"Since my first trip in July 2008, I've been to Vegas 11 different times now.  TI will always be one of my favorites, mainly because this is the first hotel I stayed at while in Vegas.\n\nCHECK-IN/FRONT DESK - 4 Stars\nOverall the front desk staff is very friendly and the check-in process is quite quick.  They have one large queue line that zig zags throughout the check-in/lobby area, which I like better than the individual lines for each front desk clerk that some hotels have.  For some reason it makes things go quicker, and you won't see someone further back in the line next to you check-in before you.\n\nHOTEL ROOM - 4 Stars\nThe rooms I've stayed in before seemed very clean, modern, warm and welcoming.  The standard rooms also come with a decent sized LCD (plasma?) TV, safe, ironing board, desk, and a nice sitting chair by the window.\n\nCASINO - 3 Stars\nI do like to gamble at TI now and then, but for some reason the theme/decor of the casino itself does not call out to me.  I preferably would like to play next door at The Mirage or down the street at Harrah's or Bally's.  The casino staff is nice and friendly though, and always willing to help you brush up on your skills at the game, or learn the game if you're a new player.\n\nDINING - 4 Stars\nTI offers a wide assortment of dining.  While some of them are not my favorite,I absolutely love the Coffee Shop and the Buffet.  While the Coffee Shop may seem pricey, I guarantee you will not leave their hungry.  They give you decent servings, especially the fried chicken meal and the spaghetti w/ meatballs meal.  The Buffet at TI is also really good.  Prices are par for it's neighbors (Mirage, Venetian, Caesars, etc), but personally I think the food quality and service are just a tad bit better than the rest.\n\nBARS -  3 Stars  \nThis is the area where TI needs to step it up a notch.  Granted they have Gilley's, but there are also plenty of other chain country bars on the strip (such as Toby Kieth's at Harrah's).  And while Senior Frogs has a great view of Sirens Cove and the Strip, I think something custom to TI would make the experience a whole lot better.  Oddly, out of all the bar selections at TI, my favorite is Breeze Bar, smack dab in the middle of the casino.  I would rate this one 5 stars on it's own.  Great atmosphere, decent drink prices, friendly staff, and did I mention it's right in the middle of the casino?  Perfect spot to people watch and have a few drinks.\n\nSPORTS BOOK -  4 Stars  \nWhile not my favorite sports book in Vegas, TI has a pretty nice one.  As always, the staff is very friendly, and willing to help you understand anything and everything about sports betting if you have questions (they just won't make recommendations on who to wager for/against).  This SB is also pretty clean and the cocktail waitresses seem to come around more often than at other SB's in Vegas. \n\nSTAFF - 5 Stars\nOverall, the staff in general (front desk, casino, restaurant/bars, housekeeping) are great and deserve 5 stars."
1,16 party.  Good service because we got there prior to opening.  Always a great mini stuffed pizza for lunch.  I had Number Uno Mini.  Very good.  Last visit pesto mini stuffed was amazing.
1,"I'm rating this for their Poker Room only.  They have a $23 morning tournament for a Mixed Hold'em.  Not bad at all...your opponents are 95% seniors (they love socializing).  Payout was not bad as well (depends on how many entries).\n\nIf you came earlier and had time to spare at the same time haven't eaten breakfast yet, try the Sport's Deli by the Sports Book section.  Not bad for a breakfast sandwich there.  They also have a Loco Moco in their menu but wasn't able to try it (I didn't have enough time to do that).\n\nOverall, I will come back here to try it again."
1,"I remember this place as Jimmy Woo's (I'm still a little sad it's gone) but Morning Squeeze was a nice stop end stop for the Yelp Shopping Crawl for Local Businesses. We were served a breakfast buffet and received 2 drink coupons, with a choice of a Mimosa or a Bloody Mary. Same layout as before just different color scheme to Jimmy's, there's 2 bars (one outdoors and one indoors, outdoor patio seating and indoor seating). Kitchen is open and booths surround the restaurant with varying tables. Food and everything was OK, drinks were nice, atmosphere was probably my favorite. I would return if I was in the area and looking for a breakfast/brunch hangout spot in Old Town!"
0,"This club sucks so much ass just went yesterday it's so small and overcrowded no place to sit and the bouncers are all fucking dicks no respect they scam you for $20 while your in the line(Fuck them I didn't pay) just so you can cut a few feet in front and wait in another line for\""VIP\"" which is really the general admission line and that's only for guys if your a girl and have a belly they wont let you in only the hot chicks get through. I saw many chunky girls get turned around and denied entrance that shit was fucked up the drinks are exaggeratedly prices $25 for a jack and coke $17 for a lemon drop I highly advice everyone not to go to this rip off of a \""club\"" I know I'll never come back again"
0,"Came in for oil change, they were rude after I asked for the basic (cheaper) service.  Did the service so quick I have to wonder if service was really done. They made sure to tell me what they did not do because I paid the cheaper service.  Now I have lights on in my car for tire pressure (which they filled).  No customer service at this place, go somewhere else."
1,I have eaten here many a times and I highly recommend.\n\nI have never had a problem and the food is pretty good.
0,"I had an amazing time the first time I went here and was eagerly waiting for the next chance to bring friends out here.  No cover, great prices, fantastic drinks, and the music was great.\n\nHowever, the next time I went there, the vibe was completely different.  The bartender made the smallest shots possible and they were still $45 for 4 of them.  There was also cover for some reason even though there was not enough people to justify having cover (no events, no appearances, etc).  Unfortunately, their service is hit or miss but the location is on Fremont which is experience on all its own."
0,"We went to this place because it had some good Yelp reviews, but I'm not quite sure what people were thinking. The server did not seem like he cared much about doing a good job, and he didn't even check back with us after we received our food. We ordered chips and salsa (they cost $2.95, but it seems like it is typical for Mexican restaurants to charge for chips and salsa in Vegas). The chips and salsa were the best part of the meal. If that's the only thing you order there, you're doing yourself a favor. I ordered a bean and cheese burrito (it cost over $10, which seemed a little pricey), and it did not come with beans and rice on the side. I also did not get an option of what type of beans I wanted in my burrito, and that seems odd for a Mexican restaurant. I received my order very quickly, and once I started eating I realized why. It was a store bought, flour tortilla, with over cooked rice and I'm guessing canned re-fried  beans inside. The cheese inside was not completely melted. It was truly the worst Mexican food I've ever had, and I'm originally from California, so I've had good, authentic Mexican food. I would also avoid the margaritas at this place. They are very costly, and there is very little alcohol in them. You're better off buying a dollar margarita in one of the casinos. Overall, do yourself a favor and go to a different Mexican restaurant."
0,"This place isnt anything to write home about.  I had the lobster and crab coob salad.  Was pretty bland and the service was slow.  If your drunk and its late, I guess it would do."
0,"We were really excited by the idea of going to iPic but disappointed with the experience overall.  While the theater was clean it didn't have the 'luxury' experience that is suggested.  The poor signage in the lobby made it confusing for a first time attendee.  Even after we told the usher checking tickets that it was our first time, she was more interested in reading her book than helping us out.  The concession stand wasn't able to serve wine (one of the machines was broken and the other only had half the selection) so told us just to go to the bar.  At the bar, we waited quite some time for a bartender and received poor service when we were served.  Service was simply OK and the expectation for a 'better experience' was simply not met.\n\nThe seats were comfortable, the theater was clean, and the sound and projection were great.  \n\nUltimately, the movie part was great but the experience was below standard.\n\nUPDATE - iPic publicly posted that they were interested in following up on these concerns but have not taken any action since I shared my contact details with them."
0,"Went there on a Saturday night, decided to dine at the bar because i was by myselfs.  I ordered bowl of Clam Chowder and the Main Lobster.  It took them about half an hour to bring out my chowder and during the mean time the Bongo player that was playing in the bar would not stop caughing (i feel bad for him, but they should really have just sent him home, poor judgement call on that one).  \n\nI guess over all, it was just a really slow night and no one really wanna be there.....maybe next time would be better."
1,"I recently moved from Bronx NY to Arizona withmy husband and kids. I tell you I was so stressed out, I was upset and having a tantrum that their were no puerto rican resturants. I was in furiated til one day i made it my mission to find a resturant no matter how far it was. I found Puerto Rico Bar and Grill online just googling. I decided thats where i was going to go. So my entire family went and my father who is a native from PR loved the place. The food was amazing I mean i didnt feel as home sick. Now all I need is to find a salsa club, with my salseras im not no pro but I love my salsa music. I am still adjusting to Arizona. its been 7 months."
0,"I wish you could rate things separately but, all the stars are just for the way this place looks... Management is horrible and the ladies the in office need an attitude adjustment... They do know we pay they're checks right... Danielle can be nice The apartment sold its self. She was kinda rude until we signed our lease!The other night the security guard was taking pictures of my jeep (which was in in covered) and he was taking pics of my license plate....so, I went out for a walk.. Yeah a \""walk\"" to see what he was doing and he was taking pics of other cars.. I thought maybe it was something they put him up to but WHY would he take a pic of a car in uncovered it's free parking to whoever comes first... did I mention once he acknowledged I was there he was do quick to talk to me and short talk with me.. Ya sketchy.Well the next day I saw Danielle pull up to the phase two and I waited for her shes usually civil with me until I was straight forward and told her the story above... And she laughed at me.... I DID NOT COME TO HER TO GIVE HER A GOOD LAUGH AND I DIDN'T FIND IT FUNNY AT all.She began to walk off and said I'll look into it and nothing else! Rude much. I've had instances where I've called ALL day and no answer but I go up there and they're all there... Wow. Last time this happened I went to pay my rent and it looked like I was interrupting social hour...  They were quick to snatch my check and my nieghbors had the law at my door asking questions about them this was 2 days after i move in...I have never met or seen them and asked a lady in the office if she knew anything. I wasnt trying to be nosey I was concerned I have a baby! Well long story short they told the neighbor who I was and that I was asking them what's up and I was being nosey... Totally unacceptable!!!!!!! Right? Right! Luckily it was nothing and I met a GREAT NEIGHBOR. I love her to death now even though that day when I asked the office... She told me she was crazy! She's really not. How high school.My neighbors across from me were let out of the lease because a scorpion infestation! They're poor six month old got bit and another neighbors little boys were but multiple times! Luckily we know how to do pest control our self. Not lucky that we have to pay 5$ a month for pest control a month and I'm home a lot an never see them.... Ive ha multiple neighbors tell me they feel helpless. There's two complexes here 5$x 100+ apartments.... Imagine the profit they make on us just off pest control.... SCAM I've seen burns twice and the techs belly was hanging out of his shirt and he was spraying the dumpster... Seriously wtf?!?!? Wouldn't that make them run to the apartments. Just sayin. You have to walk with a black light everywhere at night phase twos pool is indeed infested with scorpions under the gill there is millions... What's the point of being home when you can't kick your shoes off for fear of scorpions!!! Fix it already we've all complained enough. I know it's unrealistic to have them all gone but control it!\n\nAnd now for my biggest complaint... The biggest scam... The water.. We were never told when we moved in it was split between the buildings... Wouldn't seem to be a big deal because this is apartments right? No!!!!! We were gone all summer home maybe one week of each month... 68$ Here it's just us and a baby and we work and are never home..on top of that were in a two bedroom the SMALLEST ONE... We have two sinks a toilet a bath tub and a laundry machine we never se and dish washer that explodes so we hand wash...Scam... Last time I paid rent I just asked.... \""So is water just split between all of us?\"" she looked at me like I was stupid.Next time I'll just keep my mouth shut and give you my hard earned wasted money...And to my neighbors above me I understand kids.But seriously allllll night and day I hear doors slamming and it sounds like a dang sumo wrestling. Security has never done anything about it! I've called at least 20 times I've seen them up there ONCE! Wow! Haha. Security right? Isn't it nice when your newborn actually sleeps???? Well I wouldn't know because she's up screaming scared from the bangs all night and pictures on our walls falling.... Oh and when she finally goes to sleep...landscapers are right at her window at 7 am!!!! So cool!!!!!!!! Not. 9 am would even be a blessing when she is up all night from the neighbors above....Does this sound like somewhere you want to live for a year?  Iunprofessional 95% of the time unless your giving them money or not addressing a problem.YOU HAVE TO HAVE A PROFESSIONAL CARPET CLEANING COMPANY TO CLEAN YOUR CARPETS WITH RECIEPT... I've never heard of"
1,"It's weird that that the reviews are so skewed for Capriottis Sandwich Shop. I have eaten here several times, and have enjoyed it each time. I think the thing that hurts them more than anything else is the \""Best Sandwich In America\"" banner hanging out front. The sandwiches are really good... but best in America is a little far reaching.\n\nThat being said... I usually get the \""Bobby\""... Thanksgiving on a bun! It's a pretty damn good sandwich... it you like thanksgiving dinner. The turkey is freshly made, as is the stuffing they put on the sandwich. \n\nI have also had the meatball sub... also very good. \n\nI like this place. And I am pretty sure you will like this place. \n\nMake sure you tell them you signed up for their \""text message\"" program to get a free drink and chips on your first visit."
0,"If you are hungry, want small portions and pay outrageous amounts of money for less than mediocre service then you might consider eating her. Don't let Domino F serve you. Terrible service! We asked for extra napkins for a party of 6 and were only brought two. Drinks were expensive. $8 beers and $14 margaritas. Taco u -pick two plates are the best deal at $11. \n\nThere are way better places to eat in Vegas."
1,"This store already has a good number of reviews so there is little I can add! It was a really fun shopping experience, from the employees to the layout (\""there's a rack of cocktail dresses, there's the rack full of sequins...\"") to cute and clever hand-written quips on each merchandise tag. I was initially taken aback by the prices of the vintage t-shirts (around $20), thinking \""I could find this at Goodwill,\"" but then I remembered my countless unsuccessful trips to Goodwill... needless to say I left with a t-shirt plus an adorable 1960s Lily Pulitzer shift dress, for $30 after my Yelp coupon and the monthly special discount! Such satisfying retail therapy."
0,"Our meal here was definitely not what we were expected. \n\nThe Good:\n-The lamb shank was excellent (5/5)- soft, tender, full of flavour\n-The waiter explained all our options thoroughly so we knew all of our menu choices\n-The community this restaurant is situated in is very cute and made for a good walk after the meal\n\nThe Bad:\n-We waited for an hour for our meal...our waiter only offered us bread AFTER we received our meal..really!? \n-The french onion soup was very, very salty- I couldn't even finish mine!\n-One member from our party got diarrhea from their Mussels (Daily special)\n\nWe won't be back."
1,"This restaurant has it's pluses and minuses. With Yelp, we made reservations for 7:00 on the patio. We were seated within 10 minutes on a busy Saturday. The new location is much nicer, airier than the East Blvd. location. I really love the atmosphere and decor. Our waitress was pleasant. I ordered a house margarita which was sweet and not very strong. For dinner, I had the Marco Polo tacos. The tacos were excellent. However, the rice and refried beans were dry and bland. For atmosphere and service, I give it a 5. For food and drinks, I give it a 3.5. So I averaged it out to a 4."
1,"The service was good.\n\nThe atmosphere was a bit loud, but there was a polka band playing not too far away from our table :)\n\nThe food was great!\n\nThe sausage sampler was excellent\nThe Jaegar schnitzel was DELICIOUS\nThe spaetzal was amazing, plentiful, and cooked al dente (just the way I like it!)\n\nThe gulash was also very good (however we all thought that the meat was a bit tough for a gulash and could have been tender-er)\n\nBeer selection was nice\n\nDesserts were decidedly not German, well, some of them were.\n\nWe ordered the creme brulee, and the Milka chocolate lava cake.\n\nThe cake was AWESOME\n\nThe creme brulee... eh... not so much.  The top wasn't even crisp.  I guess thats what we get for ordereing a French dessert at a German restaurant :)\n\nAll in all, I'd go back!"
0,i think this place is really overrated. the menu is extremely limited and small. it has to be the smallest menu of any fast food place. the food is fairly boring. their buger tastes very similar to a whopper but is much smaller. prices are a little high for what you get. just ok place.
0,"In short I would REALLY like to shove my broken ass foot up this UMC's bungholio. Maybe I'm just brusque because I am in no better shape than I was before this visit.

I love when I am at these places and hear such random conversations I shouldn't be hearing. \n\n2nd. I can barely walk. Yes, it's my fault I'm such a clutz. The doctor says it's severly sprained and throws me a script for Tylenol with Codeine and has a nurse wrap my foot and tells me to go buy a cane or my own brace. WTF?! She also says it may be fractured, but I need to see a Podiatrist to find out for sure, oh and I can't workout for 8-10 weeks........Why did I come here again? Ughhh.\n\nThe TWO STARS is because this bullshit only took me a little over an hour and I was out. We all know that deserves stars. \n\nIf you happen to stumble into my office today I am the cranky one drooling with my swollen foot on the desk watching Facts of Life reruns not doing diddly and possibly sleeping.\n\nDO NOT WAKE THE DRAGON."
0,"Worst Vegas buffet I have ever had...... Nothing was fresh, sushi, crab, shrimp.... Prime rib looks good but tasted dry and tough. The ice cream they pre-scoop it and half of them were melted already (what is management even thinking?!)"
1,great booze!!! and I love love love love love love the staff! food ok! hahaha
0,Called to find out how much it costs to have some tires mounted and balanced. I was given a price per tire. \n\nWhen I arrived in the store they didn't know what I was talking about and charged double the cost I was quoted on the phone. \n\nI went here because the price on the phone was cheaper than the discount tire 3 minutes from my house. But it ended up being the same in the store. From now on I will just go to discount tire.\n\nI ended up having the tires mounted here simply because it cost the same as the other local tire shops. But the wait ended up being nearly 3 hours. Unacceptable.
1,Been going here for the last 7 years for lunch when in the office. I have seen it getting busier each time which is a good sign. You can get a roll or a baked potato with fillings of your choice  and the have a daily changing salad bar which a lot of people like but for me the real stars are the daily changing warm meal options and quiches. They do a fantastic homemade steak pie and have nice homemade burgers. Good selection of drinks and snacks as well. Nikkis is celebrating 20 years whilst other sandwich shops in the area have come and gone so they must be doing something right. They are in my eyes.
1,"I went for a relaxing lazy sunday lunch... \nFrench Onion Soup = SOOOO YUMMMMMMMMMMMMY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\nThe cheese was just burnt enough, the broth not too oniony and not too salty.  Truly perfect.\nHe got the Brie Burger = SO YUMMY!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n\nMon Ami Gabi gets one notch down because I shamefully got the spinach crepe. Silly girl you can get a crepe on the street, you get something YUMMY at Mon Ami Gabi.  Plus, our waiter was too busy chatting up a table of cougars to check up on us.\n\nNext time we are getting two soups and splitting that heavenly brie burger so that we have room for dessert. MMMM"
0,Wow... Who writes these reviews???\nThe food is pretty good but the service is horrible!!! We ate on 9/6 and the girl working there is BAD!!\n\nManagement needs to make some changes.
0,"i wish i could give a lower rating. i went for a quick tire replacement and that was taken care of, minus the manager telling me i ruined my tire pressure sensor when i didnt. the worse part was after i get my car home i notice the person who parked it hit a curb with the bumper and ripped it. i called to speak to the manager and was told he was at lunch but since i drove home theres nothing anyone will do about it. very angry and filing a complaint with the BBB."
0,"For $30-40 per entree, you can do far better.  The macadamia crusted mahi mahi is bland as sand with nothing to compliment it but blander potatoes and a few sprigs of asparagus.  Surf n turf boasted a decent filet but an extremely petite lobster tail, with a pur\u00e9e of something between the two that starts out bland but finishes like black pepper.  Waiter forgot my wife's glass of wine despite knowing this was a wedding anniversary dinner for us.  Made zero effort to make it right.  Dessert was only saving grace.  We will certainly look elsewhere for fine (or even moderate) dining."
0,"For $19.95, I would not come back again. Very unusual selection, this includes chicken feet, pig hocks, beef tendon, age egg congee and brick size water boil tofu.  Many items in the buffet bar are items you would find in a Chinese dim sum restaurant, but all are either dry up or been steam so long that they become tasteless.  The most popular item would be the steam/water boil snow crab legs, but too bad, I'm not a big fan of them."
0,"Circus Vargas\n$$$$ Please be aware and let family and friends be aware for wherever this circus travels.... I was just notified from my bank of fraudulent activity. It was traced back from the circus from when they were here in Scottsdale. When my husband purchased popcorn and drinks, the 'kid' who took the debit/credit card  also took the card info. I would not post this if I did not know for sure. There procedure for credit/debit cards is shady. They tried to use card at many gas stations , etc. \n\nIf you saw the show in AZ go check your bank statements. If you know of anyone going to the show in any city that circus will be traveling to....make sure they pay in cash for everything they purchase!"
1,Nicest ladies run dry cleaners. Perfectly dry cleaned clothes.Always ready on time.
1,"Dined here for dinner on the Fourth of July and was extremely impressed with the wonderful service from our sweet waitress. We ordered the Davino (?) pizza which was a little spicy, even for this Latina girl, but o so delicious. My husband and I shared a salad and everything came out quick and delicious. It was also really nice to sit on the patio and watch the fireworks, will look forward to dining here again."
1,Still good eats to be had here!!!!
0,I love Dunkin Coffee  but I swear this one has the longest wait times ever. I went thru and swear it looked like maybe 2 people were working. They definetly need to get their staff in order. Not to mention a worker is outside right now by the menu board smoking. How rude does he not realize that is gross smoke is going in all our windows waiting in line.
0,"Good food and atmosphere.  Unfortunately, we felt ignored by the staff.  We had to flag down servers for drinks and condiments.  The manager spent most the time we were there chatting with friends at the bar and watching the game.  This was not our first visit but it was our last."
1,"This is real pizza, with no fancy bells or whistles. Pizza  the way you would get back in NY. And I am not talking cheap, greasy pizza. I'm talking about the real deal I used to get while growing up over there. Don't expect to be waited on hand and foot either. They focus on the food and food alone. \n\nMeatball heroes, pasta dishes, tripe soup, etc. You name it, they have it. You want to take the ingredients and think you are now Mario Batali, well take the ingredients home and make the dish at home. They won't promise you will get the same results but they will sell you the ingredients imported from Italy!\n\nI love to get my tripe soup here and my pizza. No nonsense place, just a place to get a great bite to eat. This is a small place, just like any deli in NY. Many students and locals stop by here to have a bite. Many times, I have seen workers coming by during their lunch break. Visit the place if you are just looking for good old fashioned Italian food without the bells and whistles...JUST GOOD OLD ITALIAN FOOD!"
1,"Traveling from out of town and took the kids to this place.  Overall, we had a great experience here.  Keeping it from a 5 star is the price - just felt it was a little pricey for what we got but not totally unreasonable.  This is a chain that just opened  a location in ATL and we will return.\n\nKobe burger was fantastic.  Truffle fries a little disappointing but not bad.  Service overall was really good - fast and friendly.  Bartender was totally swamped and a little grouchy but no big deal.\n\nWe were staying at a hotel across the street and there is a great tunnel that goes to the Mall so you don't have to play Frogger with the traffic - bonus!\n\nOf all the restaurant choices in this Mall thought it was the best for a fairly quick meal with the kids.  There were lots of families with kids while we were there."
1,"A great hamburger \""le gros d\u00e9gueulasse\""\nAwesome tartine brandade de morue\nLovely French cr\u00eapes"
1,"Home cooking, great specials, good beer, and cheese curds! Does not disappoint but I'm also from wisconsin ;)"
1,"In a small slice of the old gargantuan South End Brewery is Icehouse.  Long gone is the beer making equipment as it was bought by Olde Mecklenburg Brewery. Luckily, Icehouse itself boasts an extensive list of craft and microbrews - so much so that's it difficult to decide.  They have about 12 on tap that rotate and the same amount of seasonals.  The waitress knew a little bit about beer, or at least acted like she did, so that was helpful. She was a good waitress - paying enough attention to us but also letting us enjoy our meal.\n\nThe food was decent and reasonably priced.  My burger was good, complete with fried pickles, and my side of veggies was nice and crisp.  The wife's seared tuna tacos served with sides of beans and rice were also good.\n\nIcehouse is a cool little place in South End for a good meal, and if you're a beer snob, it's a must visit."
0,They took out the table games and like half the machines to make room for pool tables and beer pong. And guess what? No on was playing. It used to be a fun place to play compared to the stuffy mega casios now its boring.
1,"Best food served fast in terminal 4 concourse B near gate B9- I have had the Napa Salad for lunch and the breakfast burrito for breakfast here and both were excellent.  They also make great cappucinos.  Most of the restaurants in this terminal all had salads premade in plastic boxes that looked identical.  Press Coffee made the salad fresh and it was outstanding.  Furthermore, the staff was friendly and helpful, which was the reason I first ate there, after waiting a long time at the place next door for a cashier that did not appear happy to be at her post."
0,"I went to this place for. 7 years.  The owner shawn was great, he knew all the clients names.  The staff was friendly and enjoyed working there.  Always clean and I always felted welcomed and appreciated.  The new ownership is bad, unfriendly and has the girls trying to up sale , I was asked 3 times for upgrades and extra services.  I did not enjoy the experience and will not be returning. Where are you shawn?"
0,"I bought my Civic from Zimbrick four years ago and have taken it here for service ever since. Until today, I had excellent service and the rewards program is what kept me coming back for oil changes even though I paid more than I could have elsewhere.\n\nToday I was a walk-in oil change/tire rotation. They were busy but assured me I could be out in 45 minutes. If they'd quoted me longer, I would have come back a different day, as I realize I didn't have an appointment. \n\nI waited in the waiting room -- with my three month old baby -- for an hour and a half. Finally they came and got me, stating that my paperwork had been accidentally left on someone else's desk when someone went to lunch. The technician apologized but did not go over the inspection sheet with me like they normally do.\n\nThen I got out to my car and it wasn't even washed! If I'm going to pay $45 for an oil change and tire rotation, I at least expect my courtesy wash, especially with these terrible salty winter roads.\n\nI was late for my next commitment and my baby was hungry at this point. My vehicle is seven years old and I don't need to be taking it to a dealer for service anymore. This was the tipping point. I won't be coming back."
1,Seven of us went to this Buffet.  All of us liked the food.  Everyone found food they liked.  We really liked the sushi.  My daughter ate tons of the sushi it was very fresh.    The desserts were great.  My kids really liked having cotton candy.
1,"While on vacay, you eat & drink. This place just happened to be right there when we felt the need to continue to stuff our face with more food.\n\nWe decided to order from take out rather than sit down. Ordered the loaded waffle nachos. They were yummy. Service was good too."
0,I'm fairly surprised at how many good reviews on this are here. This place was absolutely disgusting! The food was so bland and tasted like it had been sitting for a couple days. We should have known better when we walked in and the owner was sitting there picking his ear! The waitress lady was nice but the food was horrid and we all felt sick afterwards. This place was recommended by a friend and now I have to murder her! STAY AWAY!
0,"HORRIBLE. Is not funny. Can not carry a show. Theater was 60% empty. Redundant. Dont make the mistake i made, and presume he will be good and purchase tickets. Do your own research.  We walked out 45 mins in. The cover band that warmed up the crowd was far more entertaining. Either MGM-Mirage files for Chapter 13 and rips up this contract. or they buy him out. But mark my words, he wont last.  Save your money.  Dont burn your time in Vegas."
0,"got take out here twice when they first opened.  again, small portions and not at all spicy so i havent been back.  also pricey.  if i ask for thai spicy i at least expect to see some bird chilies in my food.  i have a thai cookbook so i guess i should just start making my own although its never the same."
1,"Surprise was definitely the prettiest stop along our Spring Training tour this year. Parking was free.  The ticket lines (despite having 9 functioning windows) were slow.  Luckily we got to the window to find out they had just opened up seats right behind home plate for only $22!   I was however, completely turned around by entering from the ticket windows to the outflield.  \n\nThis stadium is still crisp and clean and have the most seats in the shade out of the three we visited.  We are definitely ready for the season to begin!"
1,"Their pizza and philly cheesesteak are to DIE for. Excellent food, moderate price, and good customer service. If you're looking for a little restaurant to take the family out to lunch or dinner, this is a great place to try."
0,"Unfortunately we were disappointed in Chestnut. We gave them time to work out the kinks of a new spot but no such luck. The food is below mediocre and had no flavor! The waffles were like eating flour and water. They bring each dish out individually which makes it awkward unless you are eating alone. Numerous tables were complaining about the length of time it took to get items (30 minutes for flavorless waffles for us), the taste of the food, and the lack of silverware.  When the table next to us told the manager her response was \"" I  trying!\"" What?!?!  Don't waste your time here unless you are going for a coffee and pastry (made outside by Tammy Coe and delightful).  Go to Carmels across the street or LGO instead."
0,"This past weekend we came to glendale and stayed at the Renaissance Phoenix Glendale Hotel & Spa. We were there for friday and saturday night.\n\nWhile the people were nice, there were many problems with a hotel I was spending 260$ a night on and 15$ a day for valet parking. I was very disappointed in my stay and the value. Here are the problems listed below.\n\n- Valet was understaffed. While they were very nice, it appeared that the valet and the bell people were one in the same. There never appeared to be more than one or 2 at a time and sometimes no one was there to get the car or take it for up to 10 minutes. This is a long time when you are paying for this service. We could have parked and walked from the parking lot during this length of time. It was extremely frustrating especially when we had engagements to be at. \n\n- We paid for a nice balcony room and couldnt use the balcony. There were SO MANY FLIES on the balcony that it was disgusting and totally unusable. When you opened the door they would FLOOD into the room. This was frustrating and made it impossible to sit and enjoy the evening on the balcony.\n\n- The noise was terrible. It was unbelievable how LOUD things were at the hotel. You could hear everything said in the adjacent rooms as if they were next to you. There were kids screaming all day as apparently there was dance competition in town. However, no one told us that and one would think, when paying 260$ for a basic room, that we would be separated from the conference people full of kids. It made it so we didnt WANT to be anywhere near the hotel throughout the day. It was frustrating.\n\n- The toilet was louder than hades. For some reason when you flushed the toilet it squealed VERY loudly when refilling. It was so loud that it drowned out the TV! Additionally it lasted for 5-7 minutes EVERY time. When calling about it were were told they were ALL that way. If that was not bad enough each adjacent room was the same and you could HEAR it from them as well.\n\n- The TV was a miniature. When spending 260$ for a room i expect to have an excellent TV in the room. However this was NOT the case. It was TINY. Additionally the picture was not good at all. Really, this just isnt acceptable today.\n\n- The check out on the TV didnt work at all. When i tried to check out from the room it simply froze and didnt work. Really?\n\n- The online TV survey through the menu function ALSO didnt work. There was no way to rate the hotel when you go through the menu because the survey though the TV menu DIDNT WORK EITHER! Unreal.\n\n- Room service took FAR too long. At 1030 at night we ordered a quesadilla with soda, ice creme and a piece of cheesecake. We were quoted 45 minutes. REALLY? we could have walked to the restaurants in westgate, ate them and been back by then. Just not acceptable."
1,"Went to Bronze Cafe based on a yelp search for vegetarian food and the many raving reviews. And I have to say, my food was delicious. I ordered the Tree of Life pita and it was absolutely wonderful. I actually started with the mixed greens it is served with and I had to eat all of them first because they were soo good! The lemon vinaigrette is just wonderful. The wrap itself was so full of flavor and very satisfying. The crushed nuts were a great addition and added a nice texture. I really loved that it didn't fall apart all over the plate as well. I was also given a complimentary vegan (and i think gluten free) raspberry cheesecake due to a little incident of a decorative display falling on me (it didn't actually hit me). I don't usually go for vegan desserts (since I'm not vegan and prefer the real stuff if I am going to indulge), but it was pretty good. Wasn't much like a cheesecake but still tasty. And I certainly appreciated the gesture!!! The staff was very friendly and helpful, gave recommendations, offered samples, brought me my order, etc. I will definitely be going back for more."
1,"Wife and I had dinner there and loved it. She had the veggie burger with salted potatoes. I had jackfruit(texture and body of oyster mushrooms) tacos, the best kale ever, and rosemary beans. Well prepared and simply presented. Comfortable like only East Charlotte can be, think Lupie's Cafe or Crazy Fish. Forget an vegan hang ups. We will eat here often. This is just good food."
1,"I was pleasently suprised about this place. It's not what I was expecting at all if I'm honest.\n\nFirstly this place is new, really new - it still hasnt had a chance to loose its new restaurant shine, which is nice. It's certainly better than the old pizza hut which was here. But because its new, its often empty which is a little bit uncomfortable. Never the less, I'm sure as it gains a reputaion there will be more of the seats filled each night.\n\nAnyway, Illegal Jacks is like the illegitimate love child of Subway and Tex-mex food. You kind of shuffle along a counter while you choose your food and its made freshly in front of you. Then there is some food which is made in the kitchen and brought to you. It's a bit confusing and frankly seems uneconomical, but its different which is the main thing.\n\nThe food is good, I do like any type of tex-mex though, so see for yourself - its an experience more than anything!"
0,"Much of my criticism and compliments have already been detailed very nicely by others, so I will just summarize in bullet points.\n\n1. Great location for walkers, inconvenient for those driving from other neighborhoods. Given that it is geared toward the neighborhood and repeat customer base... (see number 2)\n2. Very limited menu selection. Literally turned the menu over to see what was on the back, only to find it empty, thought to myself, 'is this a kids' menu?' Turns out that is what everyone at the table was thinking too.\n3. In response to my request for a drink list, our server replied, \""We have every beer you can think of in bottle.\"" False. Who wants to play the game, \""Do you have {insert beer}\"" repeatedly in a noisy crowded restaurant? Write it down or memorize it and be able to tell me all of them.\n4. A basket of individually wrapped saltine crackers like one would find at a salad bar is NOT an acceptable bread item to serve with hot crab dip. Just cut the carrots and celery into adult human size, give enough of them, and/or add some nice crostini.\n5. The clam chowder is very good.\n6. The shrimp fritters are pretty good.\n\nI am interested to see if the owners read their own reviews and improve the quality of food and service. It really is a great location, and I so eagerly awaited their opening."
0,"The employees at this location always seem to have a latte up their a**. The few times that I have been here, I have felt that I'm bothering the employees and interrupting their conversations."
0,Drinks are waaayyy overpriced. \nBartenders will look your way and ignore you.\nSmall space and so crowded your always bumping into someone. \nDrunken fools everywhere.\nThe workers there are rude and wont help you.\nDepening on the DJs it is either a hit or miss.\nFrom my experience it was not worth the wait and the price.
0,Don't move here this place is horrible! The only thing it has going for it is that it looks pretty... There is something always wrong with the apartment. I would not ever recommend this place to anyone!
0,"The only good thing about this coffee bean is that it is conveniently located in the Palms Hotel. You have the option of eating the Earl of Sandwich catching a movie or even chowing down on some McDonald's :-) when my partner and I walked up, the associate at the front counter did not know what the lactose free options were. He had a thick accent which was hard to understand. One of his coworkers spoke over us and clarified the milk options. After we placed our order, there was at least five minutes that our coffee was not made. When we look behind the counter, everyone was talking and the lids to our drinks were sitting on the counter. One of the employees was talking about how her mom likes drinks to be made... I don't mind employees talking, but they should at least make my coffee first. Also, I suppose the employee who took the order did not have an open drawer because he asked us to wait. To pay."
0,Poor service at the deck pool! Paid $10 to get in as locals and waited over 30 mins for anyone to see if we wanted food or drinks. We asked for a menu and no one ever came back to take our order. The pool could use more water so all the jets are not spraying water across the pool. Hope for better service at The Salted Lime for dinner cause starving after no service at the pool.
0,"Ate here three times based on a Fodor's review of the tortilla soup, but found that the whole dining experience was below average at best.  3 things made it average to below average.  My order was mixed up 2 of the 3 times I dined there.  The quality of food (in particular the tortilla soup) was just okay-again only average.  Also, the service was slow, though they seemed to have ample staff.  Those are the cons that make me rate it as only 2 stars (and trust me, living in the Biltmore neighborhood the location was convenient where I wanted to love it).\n\nWhat is exceptional about the restaurant were the grounds surrounding it.  The architecture and design is what you would expect from Frank Lloyd Wright-excellent with sharp lines and open design :).  Check out Taliesen in Scottsdale if you want the Frank Lloyd Wright experience!"
1,"Went there on a Tuesday night with my boyfriend for \""Taco Tuesday.\"" Very cool atmosphere! The server was extremely nice and the food was delicious!"
1,"Awesome tortas!  Love this place!  Friendly service, clean, and great food.  Can't wait to go back."
1,"UPDATE: Tried the level 10 for 20 cents more. It is reallyyyyy good & tolerable even if you're not used to spicy food everyday.\n\n-----------------------------------\n\nJapanese Curry Zen is AMAZING. I usually come here after my classes since UNLV is sorta close to Chinatown, and I am always happy with the food and service I receive. The waiters/waitresses are always attentive and kind. I usually get the chicken katsu curry spice level 3. I think spice level 3 is the perfect amount of spicy and deliciousness. I have tried their curry with no spice level, and level 1 and it wasn't quite the same (although still delicious). Their takoyaki and katsu-don are pretty good, but their authentic Japanese curry is what makes this place 5 stars. \n\nIt shares the same plaza as Monta Ramen, Kung Fu Tea and SnowFlake Shavery (I recommend these places too) I hope one day they get another location for us people who live more on the south side of Vegas, like how Monta has a location on Eastern. I'd eat there more often!"
0,The woman working was so rude that I didn't end up buying anything! I asked about the bread and the attitude she had was enough for me to walk out empty handed.
0,"I love Michaels as a brand.  I enjoy crafting, new hobbies, and everything Michaels is about... I could spend my life savings in there without much of a thought.  I worked at a Michaels for two years (mind you, my feelings of shopping at Michaels are independent from my feelings of working for them) so I'm intimately familiar with corporate standards and what the employees are up against.  This store FAILS.  \n\nCustomer service: I've rarely so much as been greeted by an employee here.  When I seek someone out, they act like it's an inconvenience for them to stop what they're doing and answer my question.. or God-forbid, walk with me to another section.  If a second cashier is called up for the always-way-too-long checkout lines, they too act like it's such an inconvenience.  I saw a woman with \""assistant manager\"" on her name tag walk right by me, standing in the back of a 10-person, impatient line, without stopping to help, calling for other help, saying a word to anybody, or even making eye-contact.  Ignoring us doesn't make us go away.  \n\nStore cleanliness: There are consistently shipping boxes from incoming merchandise, overstock boxes, and extra product stacked in the aisles.  The same boxes stacked on top of the aisles is more out of the way, but still tacky.  Every retail store has to deal with customers putting things down in the wrong spot, even the wrong department, and routinely go through putting things back... that doesn't happen here, at least not often.  \n\nFraming department: I had a poster that I am VERY fond of framed here.  Again, working at Michaels I was trained in the framing department, so I know their standards.  To start, the frame samples are kept behind a counter, so I expected the associate to help me identify which ones I wanted to see.  She would bring out only the ones I specified, one at a time, as I asked for them... no advice, suggested alternatives if one didn't work, or opinions in any way.  No price guidance, no aesthetic guidance, no questions about what I was looking for, not even a trace of up-selling, and frankly no help.  I made my decisions somehow, and left it for the 10 days it would take.  When I came to pick it up, there was some of the poster \""fine print\"" (copyright info I think) half visible, half cut off by the frame.  When I asked about it, they said they had been trying to center the print, and that's how it had to be.  No, no...first of all, it still wasn't centered, so that's no excuse.  Secondly, that's a big problem, not collateral damage they should have been ok with.  Shouldn't they strive for perfection when I'm paying a lot of money for professional framing?  They agreed to re-frame it (another week) and it was positioned correctly the next time.  The last problem was evident after I got it home.  The poster, which was purchased rolled up, had small creases in it over the entire surface from having been rolled so long.  In my frame shop, it wasn't even questioned if a poster would be dry-mounted, it just was.  That would have smoothed out the poster since it is essentially adhering the poster to a piece of foam-board.  If they didn't want to include that automatically, fine, but they should have offered.  These framing \""experts\"" should have known what would happen without it and suggested a solution.  I'd have paid extra to have it done, I obviously was willing to pay to have the whole project done well.  These framers didn't take my project seriously; I mean it was a small job (relatively cheap compared to other custom frames), and a reproduced poster as opposed to original art.  Why should they exert effort into that?\n\nThe ONE exception to this review is ONE employee I saw a couple times, who went out of her way to help me.  She came to ME to ask if she could help, she was friendly, and she offered her help as a cashier when they got backed up from having only one register open.  She was on the replenishment crew, so customer interaction isn't even her usual job.  Unfortunately, everything else about this store has convinced me to stop shopping there and drive the extra ten minutes to Tempe Marketplace.  This store needs a serious corporate overhaul."
0,this buffet is horrible. i don't even know why we took a chance on this place. probably because 2 of the people in my group are cheap. ugh! one of us threw up from the food before we even left the buffet. DISGUSTING.\n\ndo not eat here. this plae is ugly and the food is horrible.\n\nwe paid $20.99 for dinner -- and you can pay $10 more for an amazing buffet at the cosmopolitan or paris.\n\nAVOID.
1,Nothing to complain about. This simple food was elegant and well thought out. If you enter from the first floor don't be fooled that the place is dead because the action is upstairs. \n\nThe wings have a dry rub that is spicy and keeps you going back for more; the short rib is delicious; the sweet corn on the side is amazing. \n\nEnjoy.
0,"I have waited a few weeks to write this review.  Originally, I had a leak under my patio with my irrigation system.  I asked Pro Irrigation to give me an estimate of what it would cost to fix it.  They came out and said the fix would potentially cost about 1/2 of what it would cost to put in a new system.  I decided to let them put in new pipes.  My original system had six sprinkler zones and four Plant and tree zones.  I expected the exact configuration on my new system and was never told that it would be different.  After cutting my Pool refill pipe and cutting another pipe, which they just threw the cut pipe under a bush and covered up the broken end, they told me my new system was ready to go.  I had just resurfaced my pool and I found piles of rocks and dirt that had been thrown in the pool by the people digging the lines.  At the end, they never checked for leaks or even program my timer correctly.  In a few days, I noticed that I no longer had four zones for my front and back trees and plants.  Everything was on the same line.  I was never told this would be the configuration.  Also, there were two leaks that they had to come back and repair.  I would not have let them install this irrigation if I had known everything was going to be on one line.  After several phone calls and some very harsh language, I was told that they were trying to save me some money.  They should have told me what they planned to do.  I did not ask them to save me money; I wanted the same type of system that I originally had.  They agreed to add the additional line for $500 extra, but I had invested as much money with Pro Irrigation as I wanted to invest.\n\nI continue to have issues with the way they set up the watering timer.  I won't call them because I don't want to have to deal with them anymore.  I would NOT recommend them to anyone.  I asked several times to have a talk with the owner, but no one would ever let me talk to him.  I could only talk to the salesperson and the estimator of the job.  Now I can't water my front yard differently than the back yard and I can't control the amount of water my trees get vs. what the plants get.  Everything is on one line.  I just decided to use this as a lesson.  Just because you see good Ratings for a company on the Internet, does not mean that company does a good job.  In my opinion, Pro Irrigation is one of those companies."
1,"falafel phoenix best falafel best phoenix best falafel phoenix best phoenix falafel phoenix falafel best phoenix best falafel\n\n6 Star Falafel !    IT'S GREEN!\n\nSeriously the best in the valley, perhaps anywhere.  AND IT'S GREEN!\n\nIt really does look like some hippies may have cooked up a batch of \""Magic Falafel\"" in the back of their VW camper bus in the Shakedown Street parking lot of a Dead concert.  I'm sure it's more benign spices making these garbanzo flour patties the color of money, grass, and a soccer player's ass, but they are a mos def a HOMEMADE recipe.  I'm not saying all light brown falafel is from a box, but that's what most gyro places are doing.  \n     8^ P`.',.`    ---pPbblltptllptbt\nI can do box all by myself.\n\nVarious kebobs, dolmas, greek and tabouli salads, pita sandwiches -- \nthe menu is classic greek fast food deli style, which just like the strip mall pad they occupy, the menu is a bit smaller than it used to be. \nThey've changed ownership and also pared down the size of their store significantly since their heyday.  \nYusef's was Best of Phoenix by New Times, or AZ Republic, or Get Out, etc, quite a bit circa 90, 92, 93, 95, 96, 2001 if I remember the signage.  Since then, things have gotten tough in the American economy for a niche market of Middle Eastern folks.  I sure hope they didn't suffer from former customers purposefully avoiding them after 2001 for any sort of discriminatory reasons -- what a shame that would be!\n\nPerusing the aisles of the grocery while waiting for your food to be prepared is like being flashed to an indoor version of an exotic marketplace bazaar (like in the first Indiana Jones movie, or hey, like Shakedown Street) full of strange and enticing shapes and smells and textures, foreign languages, and lots of \""What the heck is THIS!?\"".  \n\nSpice grinders!  Pomegranate juice! Curry powder! Turkish coffee pots!  Anchovie fillets! Fresh Olives! Tamarind extract!\nI'm ready for the PARTY!  Where's the Houkka?  THERE IT IS! Up on the wall, several to choose from actually.\n\nMy green falafel sandwich was freshly made, hot, and delicious.\nStill the best falafel in the Phoenix area (but sadly, it was found to be \""Magic\"" only in it's tasty savory goodness).   Only $5.99 with a soda, or check with the owner on bartering your knit sweater-making skills.\n\nCan anyone recommend a good Goo Ball vendor for dessert?"
1,"We've been going to this place for a couple years now, and things are changing, though not necessarily for the better/worse. The menu is now pared down to Fusion, Korean, or Mexican, where it used to be more expansive. Your fusion favorites are still on the menu, and that's the real reason to go to this restaurant, anyway!\n\nFree chips & salsa/guacamole still exists, and I love it. The guac is simple and delicious, and is a perfect appetizer. \n\nThis time I had the Fusion Enchilada Plate w/ Chicken Bulgogi ($7.50 - great pricing). Meat wrapped in fried corn tortillas topped w/ red sauce, cheese, rice, and fresh produce. Tasty and filling, but not the best item on their menu. For that I would go with...\n\nThe Fusion Burrito w/ Beef Bulgogi ($6.75). I feel like the entire restaurant revolves around the aura of this burrito. It is spicy, it is fresh, it has green and caramelized onions, pico de gallo, and cilantro in it. It is incredible. I highly recommend making use of the hot sauces they have (sweet chili and green tomatillo are my favorites). If you're looking for the true Korean-Mexican fusion experience, go with this menu item. \n\nSober, hungover, and anywhere in between, we'll be back!"
1,Finally! A breakfast place just like back home! I'm all about Chicago; it's food and it's people.  I ordered the French Toast and my guest had the Pancakes.  Both items were fluffy and served with warm syrup.  Very friendly service - family oriented atmosphere - Chicago ambiance.
0,Eve was so weak my first night in vegas ;( there was mostly asians in there and the music was horrible. The only thing is me and my girls went to beso which is connected to eve. we got a free meal and drinks and walked right into eve but I just wasn't feeling it plus it wasn't a lot people in there anyways don't care for this club at all and was disappointed since its in the Aria hotel in there upscale mall but this club was small and not poppin!! Sorry wasn't cool at all.
1,"Let me start off by saying I am a huge taco fan!  So when I tell you that the tacos here are some of the best tacos I've ever had, that really means something. I've been here multiple times and tried almost all the tacos so far, my favorites are the al pastor and the veggie. The al pastor is so flavorful with little chunks of pineapple on top... And you might think I'm crazy when I say the veggie taco is one of my favorites, most people like meat in their tacos, but this veggie taco is so tasty! Mashed potato in place of meat, mushrooms and what ever else veggies it has, perfect... It might just turn me vegetarian! Jk but it is very good. I'm not a beer fan at all, so I can't comment on the beers, but the cocktails I've had are the Dirty South Andy (kinda like a Moscow mule with little tweaks) and House Margarita (it has \""salt air\"" instead of salted rim which is pretty unique and cool!). This place is pretty new still but I think once the word gets around it will be pretty popular!"
1,"Munch a Sub makes me want to munch on a sub.\n\nWhat I am honestly a fan of is their breakfast menu. They offer good food at reasonable rates. The English muffin sausage with cheese is huge and the sausage is King of that meal. \n\nWhether you want to walk in or have delivery this place is a must. It is good, fresh and tasty food.\n\nYou can't go wrong with their roast beef sandwich, one of my favorites. You can't go wrong with any of their sandwiches. They have like 30 options to chose from when it comes to their lunch menu.\n\nWant something local with a lots of flavor? Then this is must do for you."
0,"If someone told me I was going to try a $19 burger that Alan Richman of GQ Magazine said was the \""best burger I ate this year\"", I would be pretty damn excited. And I was, until I ate it. How can a burger that costs $19 that is located in a multi-award winning restaurant suck? Bradley Ogden's restaurant showed me how.\n\nLocated in Caesar's Palace, Bradley Ogden's is positioned along a small row of restaurants within the casino. The exterior of the space is fairly unassuming and subdued, as is the d\u00e9cor within. I didn't get to venture too far into the actual restaurant, as our burger is only served in their lounge area. Apparently a $19 isn't good enough for the regular menu, although I'm sure for the price they would serve it to you if requested.\n\nBeing that this is a blend of 'house ground steak' according to the menu, it had to be ordered medium rare to sample what would hopefully be tremendous flavor. After what I think was far too long of a wait for a random week night when it wasn't that busy, our food arrived. The presentation was great as you can see in the picture, but the situation quickly deteriorated from there. Because the meat is supposedly so amazing according to the chef, the burger is served with absolutely no toppings, just a bun. You are offered ketchup, spicy mustard and a decent aioli, along with a 'salad' and fries, but that is all. Upon biting into my burger I came across the largest disappointment of the night though; an overcooked burger! You would think that at $19 they would get my medium rare order correct? No such luck. This really pissed me off, and Burger Boy wasn't that thrilled either. The meat had not as much flavor as expected for such a blend of meats, maybe because it was cooked too much, I don't know. The bun was ok, toasted pretty well, maybe a bit dry too. But together they just didn't hold up well without any other toppings and not being juicy and bloody as ordered. The lettuce 'salad' was ok, but kind of out of place here when yearning for some real toppings on my burger instead. There were also two different types of pickles that were tasty, but still not enough to redeem this.\n\nThe one saving grace of our whole meal was the fries; they were fantastic. Large, natural cut, with what seemed to be sea salt sprinkled on them, and they were delicious. If anyone remembers a place called Boardwalk Fries that was around in the late 80's, this rivaled them. But we're here to review a burger, and the burger wasn't right. Being able to properly deliver on an order is a huge part of my review, so if you fail to cook my burger properly when it costs as much as this one does is a total fail. I refuse to send a burger back during this review process, although sometimes I might be depriving myself of something better. Either way, for $19 this burger is not worth it."
0,"The Hotel Theodore is really just the new name for the Scottsdale Mondrian (http://www.yelp.com/biz/scottsdale-mondrian-scottsdale).  One day they got bought out and simply changed the name.\n\nA year ago we had a bad experience at the Scottsdale Mondrian (the worst part was being woken up two of the three nights by loud partying at 4 a.m.).  We complained, and they eventually gave us a voucher for a free night.  Not exactly what we wanted, but we decided to take a chance and use the voucher when we were down for spring training this March.\n\nOur return visit under the \""Hotel Theodore\"" banner was marginally better.  The rooms are still horribly dated (the rooms are painted white on the top half of the walls and black on the bottom, with funky furnishings to match) and slightly run-down with cheap bed sheets, but the pool area is nice, and at least our fellow guests were quiet this time.  OK for a one night stay, but we won't be back.\n\nUPDATE: They've re-opened yet again, this time as The Saguaro (http://www.yelp.com/biz/the-saguaro-scottsdale-3). We haven't stayed there under the new name/ownership, but I can see from the pictures that they've at least painted the rooms bright colors (thankfully banishing the weird black and white from before)."
1,"Best place ever  to spoil your hands and feet!   Great location, great nail techs and great conversation!   They have amazing colors to choose from and know all the up to date trends!"
0,"I have been to this airport so many times the past year not because I am an party animal or a gambler. I just happen to be Southwest frequent flyer, and Southwest just happens to put me here waiting for my connecting flight so many times. \n\nThis airport is Small and OLD. It is really really old. I am more used to it now, but the first time I got there. I was scared for a second. The restrooms are old, too. I hope they renovate this airport soon. The city should spend some tax money from all the Casino on this airport!!!!\n\nThere are slot machines everywhere, but I don't see that many people actually play. I never did, so I have no feelings towards that. I'm neither bothered by it. They do have few food options like Nathan's burger or sandwiches and hot dog. There is, by the way, a good chocolate store in the middle of the airport if you want to get some gifts or just get your chocolate fix here. It's not cheap. But good chocolate is never cheap anyway. \n\nEven it's very old, but everything is pretty well organized. All the signs are clear. And the line for getting a cab is long but super fast and super organized. No need to bump into anyone to fight for taxi, just get in line, the staff will tell you exactly what to do and where to go. Thumbs up!\n\nThere's also shuttles to most of the hotels. I believe it is $7 per person. It's very convenient."
0,"The sushi was ok,but they have trouble cooking a steak properly.  First one was too wel done and second was too rare.  Service was ok.  Not sure I'd go back.  Mostly empty on a saturday night should have been a tip off.  The view is great!!!"
1,"great food, solid service, wonderful ambiance - one of the best mexican restaurants in Phoenix"
1,Had white fish sandwich for lunch. Yelp said it wasn't open but it was. Decent price. Had branzino instead of the white fish on the menu.
1,"My friends and I loved the parlor from the moment we walked in the door.  The whole restaurant is amazing but some of my favorite things were the raised vegetable garden next to the front door, the bar with beauty parlor chairs, and the \""men\"" and \""women\"" cutouts in the bathroom door.\n\nAside from being pretty the parlor serves up good food too!  I ordered the pizza of the day, which was an amazing combination of peaches and pruchuitto.  My friends and I also shared a cesar salad and a yummy cheesy cauliflower appetizer.  \n\nOur service was just right.  I will go back again."
0,"We went for a friend's birthday as this was what she was craving. There were two babies in the group, which is fine because this is seemingly a family restaurant. I needed to change my son, but they don't have a family restroom or a changing table in the bathroom. I thought that couldn't be right, but after asking an employee this was confirmed. I ended up having to take my son out to my car on a cold night to change him. None of the employees seemed to care.\n\nAfter this wonderful start to the dinner, things didn't get much better. Our chips didn't get refilled, neither did our drinks. The food was OK, at best. Our server was friendly, but it wasn't enough to salvage the night. \n\nThis place used to to be nice, but no more."
1,"NY style, thin rust pizza. There large pizza is humungous. Chicken wings are breaded and delicious."
0,"Went for an event... Mixology Malee.  I would not recommend it.  Yes, the bar was cute.  They do have a nice wine selection.  However, the staff is rude and unorganized.  The event included a 5 course meal which was not good.  You did not get to choose what you wanted to eat and the menu was not available for review prior to the event.  Courses included pig ears, beef cheeks, and a mushroom desert.  The mixologist did an alright job."
1,"Brief: Great fresh sushi, usually a wait, No Name roll!\n\nOne of my favorite sushi places in Vegas. YUM! There's such a variety and for those who don't like the extra sauces and papers there are more plain rolls that are just as tasty and fresh. If there's anything worth mentioning is about Yama is that the fish is always fresh!"
0,Went for lunch. Wife order Cobb salad. I order prime rib open face sandwich. Slow but food finally came. Wife looked salad and said no eggs or avocados  waiter said they were out. I could not cut prime rib with steak knife  did bring another. Worse than first. Left hungry
0,"This is my second time trying Smashburger. Only a different location this time. I ordered their new Crispy Buffalo and Blue cheese chicken burger. What a huge disappointment. The chicken patty, while juicy, was over cooked. The check chicken was a golden rust instead of golden brown. One would think ordering a buffalo chicken sandwich that they would dredge the check chicken in sauce. That was not the case. The breaded piece of meat (which had very little flavor other then oil flavor) was lightly drizzled with buffalo sauce. The blue cheese was plentiful but with the lack of sauce the cheese over powered the whole thing. No spice whatsoever.  The one good thing about this chicken burger though was the tomatoes slices and lettuce were fresh. I give them one star for that. \n\nI also ordered the new buffalo fries.  First off shoe string fries? Really? They have no substance to them. Horrible move on the chains part. The \""buffalo\"" seasoning didn't taste anything like buffalo. It had an off taste very much like their normal fries (which my husband had) .\n\nI will give this chain one more chance in the far future but I will make sure to try the cheeseburgers and not the chicken."
0,I would not spend my money to get anything done here. My nails chipped within 2 hours and toes 5 days. Went back for a touch up and they were not helpful. The color was no longer there. They would not help find and did not offer to switch colors. Said I needed to pay for a polish change. Rude and not great with customer service. Recommend going somewhere else.
0,The colors bother me....really.\n\nLooks like a can of Chef Boyardee at Chuck E Cheeses.
1,"Our first butcher shop in the Valley, but after reading reviews this was THE place to go.  Got some soup bones for the pups, two steaks for us for dinner shouldn't have gone the sirloin steak as said 'was very good' next time will stop trying to be cheap and go with the good stuff.  Also got a ham slice that is the BEST we've ever had, can't wait to go back and stock the freezer with some more delish.  Maybe go back during the week when it's not quite so busy and standing room only."
1,"A flaming preying mantis guards the Downtown Container Park, which is exactly what it sounds like: a playground park surrounded by stacked shipping containers housing a group of unique boutiques, shops, and restaurants you can't find elsewhere in the city.\n\nFood options include barbeque at Ern's, frozen treats and sweets at Sasa and SweetSpot, and gourmet twists on hotdogs, tacos, and popcorn. Most boutiques are geared toward women's fashion accessories, but there is also a toy store, a Disney art store, and a general store. \n\nPlenty of stores to explore, a playground for kids during the day and adults at night, and alcoholic beverages available around every corner and in every form, from draft beers at the hotdog stand to frozen spiked pops at the popsicle place.\nWorth a visit, lots of nooks to explore, a stage set up for live music, and free parking on Sundays."
1,"My girlfriends and I come in every other Tuesday night for Trivia Tuesday! (They do trivia every Tuesday at 7:00, and we all love Holly and Chris!) Great place to meet up with friends for drinks! It's very small and cozy. We don't usually order food because they serve free pizza for the night; however, we do order our fair share of drinks for the night :)\n\nThey offer a good variety of mixed drinks, but their wine selection is pretty limited. \n\nLove this lounge!"
1,"I enjoyed myself at Tryst but I didn't really care for the music which kinda puts a damper on someones experience at a club. Don't get me wrong the venue was nice; both inside and outside but looks only count for so much. \n\nOne of the main reasons I am giving Tryst 4-stars is because they know how to treat the ladies. I went here for my sister's bachelorette party and we were treated quite well by the staff. We had no problems getting in which isn't really that surprising because we were a group of 10 ladies. Secondly, we were each given two drink tickets that had to be used before 1am which was easy enough. The bartenders didn't give us any fuss and were happy to celebrate with us.\n\nOverall\nCute place, friendly staff, good promos, but not really my spot."
0,"Worst service ever. I sat there waiting for the lady barber for 20 minutes and she saw me as one of her regular customers. She finished the guy in front of me and then turns to me and says, oh, sorry, I have an appointment right now.  These people give no consideration to someone else's schedule.  Won't be going back into this dump.  Get your hair cut from someplace that is much more professional."
0,"Bait and switch scammers!  Beware!  Worse than used car salesman. I prepaid for an SUV on the payless website, because my kids and I were going up to lake tahoe to ski (cost was $660 instead of $830 for 6 days if i prepaid in advance so of course I prepaid) and i wanted a safe vehicle in the snow and ice. Cost of SUV was 5xs the cost of regular full size sedan. When i went to pick up car, the guy at the Payless counter said that there were no four-wheel-drive SUVs available unless I was willing to pay an additional $150 per day (!!!) for an upgrade.  He said that there were no guarantees that I would get a four-wheel-drive when I rented the SUV online and that he could only give me a 2 Wheel, rear wheel drive SUV for the price I paid.  When I refused to pay the additional $150 per day, he said he would call his manager to find out \""what he could do for us\"". He walked away to \""Call his manager\"" and then came back and told us that his manager did not answer the telephone, but he could do us a favor and give us the four-wheel-drive SUV for only an additional $25.99 per day.  At that point, I knew he was trying to scam me so I refuse to pay a penny more and just asked for SUV that I had rented, even if it was a 2 Wheel Dr., rear wheel drive SUV.  He proceeded to tell me that a big snowstorm was coming in and that we may not even be able to drive up the pass with a 2 Wheel Dr. SUV.  Again, I told him to just give me the car that I paid for.  Then he said that if we got stuck in the snow, it would cost a lot of money for roadside assistance. Again i told him to just give me the SUV i paid for, even if it was a rear 2WD.  I would rather pay for chains at the Costco a few blocks away then to give this scammer a penny more of my money.  After I signed all of the paperwork, he told me that he was giving me the four-wheel-drive SUV at no extra charge. I doubt there was a 2 wheel, rear wheel drive SUV to begin with. Roads were clear and dry during our entire trip and no sign of snowstorm.  What Payless is doing ought to be considered fraud and illegal.  I felt dirty after dealing with them. I only wished I had videotaped this guy's  BS with my cell phone. May be the next customer payless tries to scam will be smart enough to do so."
0,"I basically was forced into joining Health Net, because my Blue Cross policy did not meet the requirements driven by Obamacare. Due to my budget restrictions (insuring a family of four, with 2 adults over 50) I basically had two choices, and each was with Health Net. After two months, I can say they have been generally incompetent, and I haven't even filed a claim yet. Their website regularly fails to allow me to make a payment. They don't send me bills by US mail or email, although I've selected both methods. Their Accounting department doesn't acknowledge payments I've made 40 days ago. I do have membership cards, but how can you trust a company that doesn't even have the ability to be competent at the basic stuff like billing and accounting. How could healthcare.gov use a supplier that isn't prepared to take on a large number of clients? After April their customer service hours have been reduced, which is another sign of incompetence. \nI wish I could go elsewhere, but even if I could afford it, I cannot change medical insurers for 12 months, as I understand it. Thanks to all in DC, for another job well done! But of course, I doubt anyone in the Federal government  has to deal with Health Net as their insurer....."
0,Its an Interesting location. The food was quite average. the service was good and friendly. They also had their own brew. I tried the sampler and I thought the stout sucked.\n\nIts an ok place.
0,"For years I've been using Jim and his team. I'm a really low maintenance client. I carefully keep and organize all of my tax stuff (receipts, forms, etc) and then once a year deliver them to his office. The only time I really ever talk with him or his team is when he calls after completing my taxes to let me know what the outcome is. He's been friendly and and enjoyable to talk with on the few occasions we've talked.\n\nHe's done a good job, though I've never had a CPA before so I base that only on the fact that my return is better than when I did it myself using Turbo Tax. I have noticed that my costs for his services have gone up several hundred dollars over the past few years but I understand there's a price to pay for good service so I've never complained about paying $700+ each time.\n\nThis year (2011) for the first time in the 4 or 5 year history of using Capital Accounting's services I needed Jim's team to go above and beyond and file my taxes immediately. I sat with him during the first week of February and personally explained that I was at risk of losing my entire return ($8K) if he didnt file so that I received the return prior to the end of the month. I was very detailed in my explanation and he explained that the IRS needed to update some files that would not be available until Feb 14th but that he would file my returns on the very next day (Feb 15th). Since that was the best that could be done, I agreed, thanked him and shared my appreciation.\n\nOn Feb 15th (Tues) I called his office to ensure he had everything he needed to file and to verify that it would be done that day. I left a message with a woman who answered the phone. She assured me they had everything and would call immediately if not. I heard nothing from them so I called back on Friday (18th) just to make sure. \n\nTo my disappointment, I recieved a call from Jim later that day asking me to remind him why I needed them filed on the 15th. My heart sank. I couldnt believe my ears. He hadn't filed my taxes, they were just going out on the 18th and I wasnt going to receive the return until March. All of it lost. Every single penny of that $8k is lost. \n\nThis is no way to treat customers on the ONE occassion when they ask you to do a little more than usual. The cost to use Capital Accounting's services to file my taxes? Over $8K, plus I imagine he'll even submit an invoice for his time. Talk about a disaster."
1,"You need to go here if you go to Las Vegas.  Everything about the City Center is sexy.  It doesn't matter what you do here, you can go here and do nothing, just walk around, and be blown away by the sensory overload you will experience.\n\nI know for a fact this place cost a ton a money to build.  So much so that the builder almost defaulted after borrowing so much, and spending billions without sparing almost any expense (arguably worker safety was compromised to build this massive awe-inspired structure)."
1,"This off-the-wall little place is darling.  My mom started going here to get her hair cut in 1994 when we moved to Arizona and I have been going back to get \""something or other\"" done ever since.  They have outstanding customer service, after just one visit they will know who you are when you call, and you can't beat the prices.\n\nThe staff is VERY VERY professional and they have virtually no turnover.  The owner, the nail tech, and the woman who does my brows have all been there for a long, long time.  16 years to be exact - if not more!\n\nIf you are shopping around for a great place to get in on a moment's notice or you need a new \""hair dresser home\"" - check it out.  Definitely not a risk."

0,"I will make a long story short, I ordered the build your own burger. I asked for a beef patty and the patty was literally falling apart. It was more like a ground beef nugget burger. Shake my head! I guess they thought that slapping some cheese on top would help keep all the pieces together...FAIL. From now on, I'll be making a drive all the way down to Stapley and Baseline for a les sub par Denny's experience."
1,"I love walking into this place! Obviously there is some great concert or event happening here, and I'm always super excited to take in the full majestic experience every time. \nIt's not the largest venue area, but the bar area makes up for it with a nice selection of beers.\nBe prepared to stand if your headed into the main floor for a show.\nIf you hit up the balcony as soon as you get in, there is seating available with some small tables. Nice if your taking your parents to a concert and the old people just don't like standing. \nI recently saw Eric Johnson, the guitar god himself, at the majestic and the sound was great. One of the better sound shows I heard here (sometimes the sound is mediocre at best)  \nThe bathrooms are super easy to get to during a show, and there seems to be plenty of them.\nDon't expect a giant auditorium here, it's old and small, but gets the job done."
0,"As many other reviews have said, this bar has some pretty awful staff members.  They're extremely unprofessional and rude.  The girl who works the door is a complete jerk.  She screams at people for no reason, and likes to ignore customers trying to get it, and prefers to talk to her friends and get drunk instead.  The bartenders ignored me for actually 15 solid minutes once.  I was trying to get my first drink, and I had to go downstairs eventually.  People are a little snobbish.  Belvederes is a thousand times better if you want good dancing and drinks...oh and their staff actually cares about you.  Really not a fan of this place."
0,"I have finally had the chance to check this place out and what a disappointment.\n\nLet me start by saying... our waiter, Nick... DAMN. It was almost like he was fed up in being there and just didn't give a fck. Once we sat down, he came and yes... threw out menus in our face, threw sugar bags down on the table, and asked us you guys want anything to drink?! Daaaamn serious?!?!! Why Boo??!! WHY??! Wow okay... . Came back with our teas and took our orders.. that's the last time we saw his face. \n\nIt took numerous attempts to get a runner, server, whoever worked there to ask for refills, which finally was able to be refilled, but with regular tea when I had Raspberry. Nasty... The whole time we were there... our throats were like a desert and our drinks were empty.. so damn empty,  the melted ice made a few gulps of replenishment to get us through our meals. We had to ask for gloves, we had to ask again for our pepper and  limes on the side, which our server never brought, and we even had to ask the next table to please get their server's attention for us after she was done giving them their food orders, just so we could... Ask. Even our tools to crack open our crabs were not the right tools, but after trying to get a server's attention. It was more tiring to wave down a server than tear apart our meals. From the frustration on the service here, I tore the crab legs with my own bare hands and ate like an animal. Tearing it with my own straight teeth!!! Grrr!!! I ended up doing the.. break the shell with my fingers and gently wiggle wiggle the meat out. Several times I showed my great company that I conquered a looooong piece of crab meat Ha haaaa! But then she shows off her piece, which was thicker and longer than mine!!! Oh yeah?!??!!!! I had that Ooo impressed face and nodded my head. We entertained each other... But never once were we checked back upon to see how we were doing or we needed anything. It was literally the worst service for a fun-filled environment. \n\nI heard their other new location has better service, but this experience makes me think twice to even want to give them my business.\n\nThe food was the only thing that made me want to give Any stars to this establishment. The sweet potato fries was excellent in texture and taste. The shrimp, crab, and side of sausage we ordered were full of spice and with the combination of asking limes on the side to make your own sauce.. it tasted refreshing, sweet, spicy, peppery, bitter, and ended with a great bite from the acidity of the limes. Don't forget to ask for those pepper and limes on the side.. makes a great impact with the flavors of the spices that were cooked in with the crab and shrimp. Even if you have to hunt someone down that worked there to get it! I will note that the food deserves high remarks. However, due to the lack of service we received here, it's unfortunate to give it such a low rating. But I must speak the truth and the service here was... non-existence. Damn, DAMN shame if you ask me. It ruined a good meal experience and for us to constantly try to get a server's attention is just bad news. We couldn't enjoy our food and it shouldn't be that way.\n\nAnd for that reason alone... first and last time dining here. Wasn't so \""hot\"" after all and that's the juicy part."
1,"This is my go-to place for Pho. I normally get take out since I live in the area, but sitting here is quite an experience too. This is authentic Vietnamese food. \n\nHighly recommend to anyone looking for some good Pho."
1,Basic takeout joint which happens to get it right.   Been using them for 2-3 years.   Never disappointed.
1,Went last nite!  The fish in foil was the best. So much flavor and cooked perfect!  Will be back to try other dishes. Also great idea that they offer half size portions!
0,"My rating is based upon the pushy server a few weeks ago.  It was roughly 8pm and because I was the last table for the waitress, she first implied and then directly told me to speed things up.  At mid-meal she brought a plastic container (with lid) of iced tea as if I ordered a tea to go (with half my food still on the plate).  Bringing the check, she asked me to pay immediately because she was leaving------I said \""Don't you close at 10pm?\""  My guess is she is probably a good server and very efficient, but if she is starting to boss customers around, then it's going to send people away who may not come back (there are a lot of places to eat)....."
0,"I USED to love Little Chicago's.  When I first moved here, it was the only pizza I knew, and the only I cared to know.  The pizza is deliciously cheesy and greasy; which is perfect for a late night slice of pizza.\n\nBut now that I've tried the likes of Pizza Sola and Blue Grotto; Little Chicago's doesn't seem quite as tasty. \n\nNevertheless, I wanted a pizza delivered tonight, so I called Little Chicago's.  At 11:30, on a Thursday night.  That doesn't seem like a tall order for a pizza joint that delivers.  But the phone call I just experienced would suggest otherwise.  The girl that answered the phone seemed...perplexed.  Why...what...where....do you want a pizza delivered???  It seemed a foreign concept.  Really?   \n\nI know that every time I've been in there, the employees have been in an alternate state of being...but seriously.  So much so that you forget you're working in a delivery pizza joint!?  \n\nIt was really disconcerting to call a pizza place at 11:30 on a Thursday night (a Monday night, maybe?) and catch them off guard and confused about an order as simple as \""large pepperoni, delivered\""."
1,"Tonight 16 Oct. 2014 was the second time that I've seen the Beatles LOVE show at the Mirage Casino in Las Vegas. This show is definitely worth seeing. The dancers, the aerial artists the music all come together in one flowing magical evening. If you get to see one show in Las Vegas I would highly recommend this one there are two shows every night except Tuesday and Wednesday.\nTickets range from $79 up to about 175. I think sitting higher is more advantageous as you get to see things take shape. However tonight we sat nine rows from the stage and that was very good as well."
1,"great local business, servers are very attentive and run around like chickens with their heads cut off they are so busy usually. this is a strange little spot but so good. everything i have had from burgers to seafood was a yummy delight. one of these mornings when im not working im going to go over there and have some breakfast!! :) ive heard great things! my only peeve about the restaurant is that they dont have a to go menu..."
1,"Fun place to be. Beer is expensive 15.00 for 1 liter of beer but the atmosphere is awesome. It's loud n you will be seated with other strangers but people do mind their own business. We fot the jumbo pretzel special for 13.95, yummy. The schnitzel was good n I got the 3 sausage combo for 19.99, kind of pricey. Don't forget to order your favorite shot n get a butt spanking for your beer maiden."
0,"First time at Majerle's with three others. We went before the Rattlers playoff game but after a D-Backs game, so it was really hopping in there. Got seated right away though. \n\nWe were seated in the back room and although our server was pleasant, it lengthened our service time considerably. \nOur daughter ordered the salad special. It had bountiful toppings and the right amount of dressing. Her husband got the Rojo Diablo sandwich. He said it was 'stringy' and didn't finish it. My wife ordered a burger and asked that it be wrapped in romaine for a 'lettuce bun'. She got a burger sitting on top if green leaf lettuce. I got the All-Star burger. It was good but overcooked by two levels. \n\nThe fries and sweet potato fries were good, as was the selection of drinks. All told, for three sandwiches, a salad and six beers it totaled $85. Too expensive for the quality but they charge a lot due to location. \n\nThunder Dan better get back to his restaurant and read the reviews. I may not be back."
0,"This was mom's favorite place until today. We came as a family of 6 and since they expanded, they now add an automatic 18% gratuity. We ordered several dishes to-go and those were also included in the 18% gratuity. We asked the owner to take it out but to no avail. This is not an 18% gratuity place. Never going again."
0,"I never wanted to be one of those people that give bad reviews but I just had to.  Maybe it's because I grew up in California and have had better pho's, but this place was no pho. I don't know if I came at a bad day or somebody was new but food was bad. No good service can compensate for the food. That's how horrible it was. Don't get the rice plates! Stick with the pho. I didn't try their appetizers but maybe that would be better."
0,"How do I describe my experience here? Horrible and pathetic. If my name were on the place, I'd verify the quality. First, took and hour to get appetizers. Second, two hours for good with a \""medium\"" requested burger clearly \""rare.\""  I would not only not recommend this place, I would persuade people against it. Horrible worst burger I've ever had."
1,"Did you know the specials are here at the top? Because the greasily myopic server will remind you of this no matter how frequently you visit.  You could get the best damned French toast in the world at Sam's every weekend, and I'm pretty sure he'd still point out the special.\n\nDid you read what I wrote there?  Best. Damned. French. Toast. In. The. World.\n\nHow is it so good?  That's a good question.  Somehow the combination of totally ordinary white bread and totally ordinary pancake batter transcends the potential of both parts to result in something truly drool-worthy: a giant slab of golden brown toast in a pool of butter and syrup.  If you like French toast, there's no reason to consider anything else on the menu.\n\nBUT if you do, you'll find that they also have grits - a rarity above the Mason-Dixon line - swimming in butter, crispy bacon, truly over-medium eggs, and delicious pancakes.  The coffee is, well, blackish, but it's really not fair to judge a diner on the quality of their coffee.  Your mug will always be full, for better or for worse.\n\nMy husband and I moved away from Champaign in 2007 but make a point of having breakfast at Sam's whenever we're back.  There are better-for-us breakfasts in Champaign.  There are fancier breakfasts in Champaign.  But there's only one Sam's, and we'll keep coming back as long as it sticks around."
1,"yes, the rooms are average, yes it's an older hotel...foods old school Vegas, not what you expect from a strip hotel. \n\nThen why four stars you ask? \n\nService. Period. It counts, for ALOT!\n\nI like a moron left my iPod. I called them, they sent someone to the room while I was on hold, found it, and are shipping it back. Everyone was all smiles. Things came when you asked for them. Granted until they bomb it (like they do everything that gets outdated in Vegas) and rebuild. I wouldn't choose this as my top choice hotel...\nBut if they had an Internet special, I'd jump on it! \n\n& when the crazy city center is complete behind the property...It'll be fun!\n\nThey'll treat you right.."
1,"300 East is a classic Dilworth establishment that has been open over 25 years. Many of the menu items have endured such as the Sonoma salad - one of my favorites and the Usual. They used to have an \""Unusual\"" but it looks like that one is no longer regularly available. The setting is quaint and charming in a renovated old house and you must check out the cute signs that mark the bathrooms. A cozy full bar with a generous wine list is downstairs and there is seating upstairs, downstairs and on the patio out front. Lunch, dinner and brunch are served and a kids menu is available as well.\n\nI recently enjoyed the homemade pimento cheese dip as well as a crab cake sandwich. I tried the gazpacho, which was more of a tomato soup with chunks of veggies rather than the blended variety that I like better. On another visit I tried the goat cheese appetizer - delicious with sun dried tomatoes and roasted garlic - and the aforementioned Sonoma salad with chicken - love the Dijon mustard dressing and the inclusion of red potatoes. Desserts are also tasty including the peach cobbler with ice cream that I sampled. 300 East truly has an eclectic menu with several unique salads, pizzas and Mexican inspired options as well as a full sandwich and entree menu. Vegetarians will find plenty including black eyed pea falafel and farro saute. Definitely a fun and different place to dine in Charlotte."
0,"Oh boy, where to start..  The wagyu beef burger - seriously, that is not.  It was a perfect copy of In-n-out. \n\nThree hours to get through dinner.  There is a big disconnect between the look of the place and the end result.  Needs a kitchen manager bad.  \n\nNot gonna be back. No way.  The staff was friendly, service was fair, but we waited a very long time for the \""American\"" styled tapas.  \n\nA few sparks of potential, but the team just could not pull it off. \n\nI lament spending $21 for an In-n-Out burger. When my wife leaned over and said; \""Nice cafeteria burger...\"" I knew this was not gonna end well, and it didn't. \n\nUgh."
0,"Sakana's had always been my favorite casual sushi bar in town.  It was very inexpensive and the quality was very good. However the wait staff is among the worst in town and never fails to detract from my dinning pleasure  \n\nI go there 3 times a month instead of the 3 times a week I'd go before they took a turn for the worse.  When i do go the hostess and wait staff always appear angry,\n\nIs it to much to ask for a smile or at least not the pissed off look they serve on a regular bases.  If they would only take a page out of the way Oregano's hires and trains their wait staff, Sakana's could be iconic. Their Unagi use to be legendary now.... forgettable) \n\nOwners please fire everyone except the sushi chefs' and hire nice happy people who enjoying working with the public and bring back your legendary Unagi even if your have to charge more!"
0,"I went in for some wings on the Tuesday special.  When i went to the bar to order the waitress gave me my bill and it seemed high so i asked how much were the wings and i thought it was .35 cents today, she stated that the .35 is dine in only and you have to purchase a drink.  I stated that I had ordered wings from the bar before on Tuesday and the price was only .35 and i didn't have to purchase a drink.  She stated that some of the wait staff may have done that before but the policy was dine-in only and i'm only doing what i was told to do.  To make it so bad this same waitress was the same person who had taken my order before and gave it to me at the .35 cent price.  I asked to speak with the manager.  When the General Manager came over i explained about the inconsistent practices and she peered at me like a deer in the headlights.  The other stupid thing she mentioned is that if i had decided to eat in they would only box up so many wings...so that means if i ordered 20 wings and only ate 6 they would only box up 8 (for example)of them and i'd have to throw the other 6 out or eat them... that is the dumbest thing i have ever heard.  I told her i wouldn't be back, I'd go to BW3 or someplace that don't have these ridiculous rules over some wings... smh.  I won't be back....  btw the wings weren't good.  The parmesan wings had no flavor what's so ever, all the wings were small...would have been better off at BW3"
1,"Very good service, outstanding rooms. I was there on business, not pleasure...i promise. I cant speak for the restaurants, entertaining, or pool, just the rooms (for one night). In my opinion, these rooms are better than at the Four Seasons, and half the price."
0,"Small TVs, no draft beer and it took 45 min to get our food order placed. Server didn't write down the order, tried to do it from memory and got it wrong.  Save your time and money, go somewhere else."
1,"I really liked this restaurant..  It's fresh, a little on the trendy side. Casual enough just for a quick nice lunch or dinner out. I like to keep my carb count load down, so I do have eat around the menu. However it is a pizza and pasta place.. so what do you expect. Service was great, friendly .. I will definitely go back.\n\nfun time"
0,"I really love Mexican food. A lot. And I cannot stand to eat at this restaurant. I've had a few different things on the menu, but I am just never satisfied with the quality of their meat. Every time I've had anything with chicken on it I've been greatly disappointed. Qdoba is basically the only restaurant I will not eat at. And I will eat almost anything."
1,This review is just for Happy Hour:\n\nI finally got to try out BLT Steak granted it was just the happy hour menu but I was still blown away.  \n\nFor starters the prices are no where near the full dinner items so it really makes it affordable to just pop in and see what this amazing place has to offer.  \n\nThe drink list is huge and again very affordable.  I recommend the mojito very good and just the right mix of tart and freshness.  \n\nFor light bites I had the Duck Pate with wine mustard which was very good.  It had some nice earthy flavor that the wine mustard really played well with.  I then got the steak tartar which was just phenomenal.  It had a little kick to it and the steak just melted in your mouth and absorbed all the richness of the quail egg.  \n\nI can't wait to go back for dinner service.
0,"My boyfriend and I ended up getting food poisoning!  I was extremely disappointed, because the location is near our condo and the staff was so friendly!  I think we are going to the emergency room!"
1,I love amsterdam!  Nothing is better than the Sunday night Karaoke and the $5 martinis and manicures on Mondays.  It can definately get very crowded on the weekends so be prepared to wait for a drink.  Oh and Sam Adams Cheery Wheat is on tap.
0,the service was lousy. i have had better service before at the one at arrowhead mall. my daughter spilled her drink and they gave her an apron to clean herself? they left the soda on the floor so we had to step on it the whole time. what?
1,"We've been coming here since The Bay opened! There is no better pool in any hotel\non the strip. The lazy river is just so relaxing that spending all day in it is not unusual, unless there are too many people, then it's good just to cool off.\n\nGet the chicken tenders, they give you a mountain of them with french fries to match! They won't allow you to bring in coolers with wheels, but I have brought in soft bag-type coolers with no problem."
1,"Went for pop-up charity sale event.  So not yet had the full-on nightlife experience.    The space is very nice and the food is shockingly nicer done for a bar.  We had the wasabi slider and soy/wasabi chicken. Both were excellent! (color me surprised). The chicken was perfectly marinated and wood grilled, doesn't even need the dip.  The slider was terrific as well though surprising with a dim sum steamed bun style bread."
1,"We ordered the fried ravioli and Sicilian style pizza, both were pretty good! More of an herb sauce, not too sweet.  The square Sicilian dough wasn't as fluffy as I wanted, but overall was a good pizza, very fresh!\n\nOwner is from Long Island and definitely is east coast style pizza\n\nThis place is tucked behind another building in the plaza, but I'd say worth the find"
1,"Just got back from our 5 day adventures in Phoenix and I must say the facility is pretty neat. I love it... I haven't really been to many conventions centers... matter of fact this was probably my first one ... I have only been on the outside of the SD one. Maybe I should go compare the two....\n\nBut the parking is very accessible, the facility is well maintained, clean, people are very helpful there and its HUGE!!! \n\nI looooooooooove the food choices in the center, although they were a little pricey, but it was well worth the buck. I hope to visit the PCC again for another event just to see how it is ran for a different event..\n\nGreat job on the architecture as well... very nice!!!"
1,Some of the best pizza in town. Fresh ingredients in both the pizza and the pasta.  I've tried different menu items and you can't go wrong with anything you order. The place is very clean and nicely decorated.  Fast service and friendly staff.
0,"I'm going to bash this club because it really sucks. I would not take the time out of my life to lie about a club or review so believe me. Vegas has a lot of hustlers and promoters so I would guess that most good reviews for this club are promotors or hustlers. The music is lame, I would listen to it on Pandora while washing my car in the hot sun not inside a supposedly nice club whe re there is a strict dress code. I would give this posing place a -10000 if I could. This place is a complete joke. They are wayyy to expensive for the type of service u get. They don't even check everybody they let anyone in so all the idiots on the strip go inside this joke of a establishment. They are only in business because its Vegas and this is the trashcan of america. Really not Detroit, not Mexico( not america) but Vegas. Also there is \""top flight\"" security all thru the building so u feel u are in a federal building or the courthouse because the just watch u like a hawk, i guess like the other review said they want u to be so uncomfortable that u foolishly buy vip tables and bottles. Like u are already guilty. Look at the other reviews and avoid this place, its just surviving off the name. This place sucks. I bought a Budweiser and rum n coke $20. Too much if u ask me for this place. DO NOT GO TO THIS JUKE JOINT. If u wanna waste ur money give it to the casinos not this joint. I am totally disappointed in this joint. It was the do-do that stained my Vegas trip."
1,Oil change without the hassle. Went to Big O Tires next door with a coupon and was told they didn't have any oil. So tired of oil change places trying to scam me by telling me various work and upgrades are required. This Jiffy Lube changed the oil without the nonsense pitch and hassle. Will go back.
1,"I went here for a friend's birthday and it was surprisingly pretty good. It's probably one of the only Asian buffets in Pittsburgh within a reasonable distance from Pitt's campus. There is a very wide selection of food. My favorite part was the sushi bar--they had lots of different kinds of sushi and selections of sashimi as well. \nDessert was alright--they offered some fruit/fruit salads, ice cream, and cake. To my surprise, they also had white fungus bird's nest soup, a lightly sweetened soup with a slightly syrupy consistency that my mom often made for me at home. It was really refreshing to see something like that in Pittsburgh. There is a chocolate fountain as well, but the chocolate tastes more like Hershey's syrup than actual chocolate and has a grainy texture, so I wasn't a huge fan of it. Still cool, though."
1,"FEZ does a damn decent job at most everything they touch. I've been twice now (with groups that like to share) and the quality is high, dishes are flavorful, and the prices are great. Service has been tops both times and the atmosphere is downtempo, laid back, but not blaring-music-loud. Very cool.\n\nI had their mushroom burger my first go around, which was pretty damn tasty, but for being not quite as medium rare as I would've liked. Otherwise, it was damn good.\n\nToday, I split their pomegranate chicken with the fiancee. It was fantastic; perfectly breaded, insanely flavorful, and the chicken was hot while the salad it was served over was still cool, which I really appreciated. (We were there at 3pm on a Sunday; I hope that'd still be the case during their more busy time as well...)\n\nThey have great hummus, good sweet potato fries, and fresh, creative salads. \n\nOverall, a fun twist on psuedo-mediterranean, like a more competent Pita Jungle in a sense."
1,"I've been going to Dr. Lobato for years.  I changed dentists for a brief time when my office location moved to the opposite side of town and never had the postive experience I had at Dr. Lobato's.  He is an effective doctor and makes a visit to the dentist a pleasurable experience, ESPECIALLY for going to the dentist.  His office and staff are friendly and most important, timely.  The longest I have ever had to wait is less than 10 minutes and I have never had to return to have any work revisited or corrected.  I'll be a customer and patient for life.  Craig Tomlinson"
1,"I'm writing this on behalf of my wife and myself.  In addition to my wife's regular checkups for about a decade,  Dr. Grade was the doctor for all three of our children.  We've always felt in the best hands with her and we'd highly recommend her as a doctor."
1,"First of all I am HUGE into service and this was by far some of the best service I have ever received. Chef Flemming even came in after hours, because I was working so much, to help me choose a cake for a baby shower I was hosting. I took a picture of something very elaborate that I had found on-line and he totally pulled it off. The shower is tomorrow so I will report back how it tastes....but it is beautiful to look at! \n\nPics to come!! Also, besides having some of the best service in the business, his other treats there are great. I bought whoopie pies their last week for my staff and everyone loved them. They are not too sweet but perfectly creamy. A must try!!"

1,"My sushi loving son and I were on our own on a Sunday night and decided to check out the new Katana Japanese. I'm glad we did.\n\nWe only had sushi, so we'll have to come back to try that hibachi.\n\nWe ordered a Manhattan Roll, a Pink Lady Roll, and a Phoenix Roll.\n\nBefore our rolls were served, the chef offered us a small, complementary plate of tasty treats: four little rolls of peppered, seared tuna wrapped around a little tuft of seaweed. Delicious!\n\nRolls were nicely sized and priced. We've been back, and had similarly tasty Udon soup as well. Still haven't tried hibachi though..."
1,"I really like the bartender,  she kept busy, but had time to recommend some great beer.  I really had a great time"
0,Big fan of the Jabs. Hated the show. Bought tickets the same day of the show and ended up in the balcony. Couldn't see anything that was not on stage. A big part of the beginning is off the stage in the crowds.  \n\nJust watch So You Think You Can Dance auditions and you will see better dances. I am not saying dancers. The Jabs are great but their show bites the big one. \n\nI have seen almost all the major shows in Vegas and this is definitely at the bottom. Wouldn't watch again if it was free.\n\nI don't know what show the other Yelper's were watching. \n\nThe only reason I am giving 2 stars instead of 1 is because I am a fan.
1,Management team are taking feedback seriously!  Definitely a plus!  Hope their customer service will improve next time when we visit Vegas.  We always expect excellent service for SLS as we stay in their hotels several time in differ locations.
0,"This place is less dirty and gross looking than their counter part on Decauter.  It's also a lot bigger and easier to get around.  Liked that they have a chocolate fountain too and the dessert seemed freshly made.  It's in a good location at the outlet mall and pretty close to the parking garage.  I can't say much for the rest of the food for me not eating seafood or sushi.  No teriyaki beef here but they did have fried chicken, which I thought odd for a seafood place, but it was pretty tasty.  I would maybe return but if I had a choice I'd stick with the chinese place in the food court."
0,"I think this place is overrated and \""cool\"" just because people say it is (and because, yeah, it is a funny name)\n\nIt's incredibly overpriced-- $9 for a damn burrito-- with no chips, no guac, no sour cream, NO CHEESE-- all those cost extra?\n\nplus, handful of times i've been here (because my friends insisted they liked it... until i brought them to reality), they salsa containers have been empty, and stayed empty even after I notified the staff. By they time they refilled them, everyone else in my group had eaten so I felt I needed to eat anyway, even without the salsa (which i desperately needed because bland meat, rice, and beans in a plain tortilla wrap just isn't that yummy)\n\nthe food is seriously bland unless you get all sorts of add-ons, which is unreasonable because it costs so dang much to begin with!"
0,Don't bother ordering the Red Velvet....it was the worst one I have ever had. It was a dry devils food with sweet dry frosting.  The chocolate marshmallow was awesome.
1,"I like this place. We sat at the bar and had fantastic service from Bobby. One (of many things) that Fox does right is they hire/train their staff and the service is always terrific  I always enjoy watching how everyone pitches in and all of the employees' outstanding attention to detail. I think other restaurants should take note, food tastes better when you are well taken care of...seriously!\n\nI had a sour cherry paloma cocktail (a tequila based drink)  and I have to say it is probably my favorite drink in town now. Very yummy!It was served (as was my friend's beer) in a cute mason jar. The one caveat was that it was an $11.00 drink, (but easy to justify since I get a lot of Fox gift cards as gifts and used one Saturday night.) :) Yay!\n\nMy friend and I decided to share shrimp cocktail which I felt was a generous portion and the sauce had the right amount of kick. We also shared the king crab with butter in jar w/ grilled bread...yum...very succulent (not a word I use a lot...but my brain kept thinking it while I was eating...so i will go with it)...:) We also ordered some garlic fries with aioli saude..(oink..oink) They were thick cut wedges-pretty good but I probably wouldn't order them again.( I will save my french fry quota for the year for El Charro and their to-die-for truffle fries..)\n\nI did not partake in their oysters which is their specialty but have made a commitment that that will be the route I take next time I am there.\n\nThe restaurant is located in the midst of the Yard and Culinary dropout and the Yard bar was hopping on Saturday night. Little Cleo's itself is quite small and very modern with an open kitchen and the back wall of restaurant opposite the  bar is all windows so you can people watch if you are so inclined."
0,"Kmart has taken a steady decline for years. this store just screams low class, unhappy workers, low quality products, and cheapness. I only stop here when I do not want to drive farther for basic necessities."
0,"Service was good.  Food was terrible, from bread stick and dips to artichoke/goat cheese ravoli to seafood risotto.  My companion ended up with food poisoning, think it was the clams!   Would not go there again."
0,"A bit pedestrian in terms of food quality and creativity.   The lasagne didn't come close to my anticipated return for the cash I shelled out for it. The pot of Tea was as described - a pot with tea in it.  Yes ha ha the cosy was shaped like a little lamb. The only redeeming point was the cake which was rich, moist etc etc.\n\nI'm not sure the location lends itself to a quirky tea/coffee/cake place. The big open plan room caters to the Morningside mums wot do lunch with the mandatory jogging baby strollers but left me feeling a bit exposed."
1,Great food highly recommend this place to lots of friends. Everyone has enjoyed it so far. I wish they were open for lunch I would eat there more often!
1,"When I was a kid, one of my mother's go-to cocktail party antics was to have her friends guess the cost of her entire outfit. My mother never failed in pulling the most obscenely low price out of her ass, \""MY ENTIRE OUTFIT - LESS THAN $1!!!\"" Growing up, my mother routinely dragged me to estate sales where I would horrifyingly watch her bargain with an aging fiduciary for a dead person's undergarments. Every Sunday my sister and I would be forced to spend hours with her in the dusty clearance section of Ross Dress for Less, as she tried on endless pairs of scuffed Anne Taylor pumps. The fact that my mother exacted some strange satisfaction from being bombastically vocal about her spendthrift tendencies was always embarrassing to me, and I desperately never wanted to be like her. \n\nUnfortunately, I have become my mother.\n\nVIVIENNE WESTWOOD SUNGLASSES! FOR $50!! Seriously people, the designer sunglasses here are CHEAP, and surprisingly, the majority of them are not the vulgar rhinestone encrusted, oversized sunglasses with \""DIOR\"" prominently displayed on the frames that you'd expect. The accessories section is cheap and worth a look, a lot of the mid-level designer handbags here are so drastically marked down they would make my own mother salivate. Women's ready-to-wear can be disappointing, as well as the shoe section. Men's sportswear and suits are comparatively better than women's sections. Overall, a great forum for some mother-daughter discount bonding."
0,"I was in town to play a Video Poker Tournament at Bally's.  After I checked in for registration, I only had about an hour before my time to play.  I was starving and couldn't wait to get some food in me.  Thinking we could probably get a quick bite at the cafe, we proceeded to the diamond desk.  We were seated promptly.  \n\nThe place was busy but we got our drinks fairly quickly, the waiter got really busy delivering food to other tables.  He finally came by to take our orders and I had to tell him to put in a rush because we hadn't got much time.  He was nice to say 'no problem'.  \n\nMy fiance ordered a Western Omelet (yeah, he loves omelet), and I ordered a Paris Combination which had 2 pancakes, ham (bone-in), and 2 eggs.  I didn't like my breakfast at all.  The pancakes were not fluffy, the bone-in ham were interesting (with fat and skin still on), and the eggs (over medium) were just eggs, you know.  All these for $40.  I think I get better food at Denny's for about 1/3 of the price!  \n\nParis is supposed to be a 4-star hotel.  I am shocked at the restaurant quality at Paris.  (I also made the mistake of going to Le Villiage Buffet the next day.)  In fact the diamond lounge serves better food than the restaurants.  The only reason I didn't go to diamond lounge was because it was closed at the time.  \n\nParis Hotel Casino is a nice place to visit, but for dinning, this is not the place to be."
0,"Brett was the guy who was supposed to come set everything up for us. He even made room in his schedule, so we prepared to give him a hefty tip for his courtesy. He spoke to my girlfriend on the phone, but I was the only one home when he dropped by. After figuring out that I wasn't the one he had spoken to, he thrust the modem and cable box into my arms, and claimed that the deal was that we would set it up ourselves. We never, ever, claimed we would set it up ourselves, and on the phone he made it sound like he was going to be doing us a huge favor. Well, thanks for nothing Brett, and I'm going to use the tip you were supposed to receive to buy my coffee this week. \n\nI guess we had too much faith in these guys, even though Cox already has a reputation for having crappy customer service. Wish we had the option to go with someone else, but we don't. Would not recommend."
1,Cool concept!
0,"terrible service!  the only advantage of this liquor store is it's close to the strip.  I went there to buy some liquor on a friday night and after I left the store, I couldn't find my phone.  So I called my cellphone to see if it's somewhere in my car.  The phone wasn't shut off and it wasn't in my car.  So I decided to call back the liquor store.  the person said they didn't find any phone.  Then I asked if I can come back and check myself.  The person said sure but insisted they didn't find my phone there.  However, when I called my phone again right after I told them I was coming back to check, it was shut off.  I don't know if it was just a coincidence or they were scared of my phone might ring when I come back to check and call it again.  And just to be fair to them, I clearly remembered talking on the phone with one of my friends before heading over to the liquor store.  So the chance that I lost my phone in the liquor store is very highly! On top of that, the liquor is ghetto as hell and doesn't have plastic cup for customers.  What kinda of a liquor store is it if it doesn't even have cups?\nDon't go there if you don't want to lose your phone !"
0,"Oh I hate this place.  Overpriced and crappy food.  For unknown reasons I have ended up here a few times.  Drunk, early riser, or hungover.  I'll give you the early bird perspective since that would be the most clear experience.  I paid $10 for a crappy mimosa and had a so so omelet.  I know this place looks inviting and convenient, but just walk a little bit and try elsewhere.  I didn't try the buffet, but it's probably about the same price."
1,Very affordable and delicious. From the salad to the chicken bowl. The veggies are fresh and perfect not mushy at all.
1,The food is delicious very authentic but it is pricy.  They dont have happy hour so its a minus. But if you are looking for a Delicious bite and you have the money this is a good place to experience
1,"This is the first bowling alley i went to when I moved to Charlotte.  I loved this place old school atmosphere, cheap drinks. unlimited bowling sundays, and the leagues are varied.  They have serious leagues ( decent cash payout) and fun leagues sponsored by bars.  Always a good mix of people and can be fun either for open bowling or league.    Also, its on Montford and there are a ton of places on that street to go to afterwards.   New owners have taken this place over and are totally renovating it.  It kinda sucks because its good to find a place that feels like this.  They will probably turn it into a gigantic version of strike city and then it will be meh and overpriced.  We will see."
0,"Horrible experience at this local restaurant. My party of 3 people on a Friday night at 9pm had to wait over a half an hour for a GREASY, BURNT cheese pizza. I had to use several napkins to absorb the grease & couldn't even consider eating the CHARRED, BLACKENED crust. We were only given 2 forks, one of which was so bent, it looked like it had been used for origami. Reason for the shortage of forks? They had a big rush before we came in and ran out, so had no additional clean to offer. Waitress returned half way through our meal, telling us that they STILL had no clean forks. Finished our meal - forkless. Bathrooms - both male & female were SERIOUSLY BELOW standards. Toilet paper all over the floor, NO WAX PROTECTOR SEAT COVERS OFFERED & paper towels in the sink. An abundance of staff was on duty at the time, even though they were NOT busy at all with patrons, clearly they weren't put on dish washing or bathroom duty, either. GROSS! Cost-$28.00"
1,"Funny, we went to 808 Sushi but had no sushi... actually, Poot had a few pieces of sashimi, so I guess that counts.  \n\nImagine stepping out of your car on a cold night and inhaling the delicious smell of Asian food.  In the same parking lot and actually the same corner there are Thai, Hawaiian, Japanese-Hawaiian, and Chinese restaurants. And it smells like... well damn, it smells like freakin' heaven.\n\nI got the combo plate (11.95) with Kalbi Beef.  It comes with rice, miso soup, salad and edamame.  Miso soup seemed like it was missing something and I longed for tha Hanaoka miso soup.  The edamame also seemed a little flat and over cooked.\n\nBut wait, there's more.  The kalbi was tender, smoky, and delicious.  It was a good portion size and there was enough for me to be \""busog\"" and take some home with me (which I'll enjoy as I write and watch football tomorrow).  It tasted like party food.  If I closed my eyes I could imagine my family there being loud and kids running around.  Comfort food is definitely the key word when I think of this place.\n\nBF had a B combo plate (13.95?) of chicken teriyaki and sashimi.  Not a fan of sashimi so I passed on that.  But once again, the charbroiled teriyaki did not disappoint.  \n\nI can't wait to go to sleep and wake up so I can eat my leftovers."
1,"Tried the breakfast buffet this morning. After picking up the girl from work ( 5:30 am ) decided to hit the M Resort. put some $$ on the craps table ( btw - great group of employees at the craps table .) I wasn't even there 5 minutes ( shared my oyster bar experience, opinion on the resort, etc. ) when the floor guy offered to cover the buffet . The place opens at 7:30, we hit it at 8. Very few people eating. \n\nI like the look of the place - circular design with a very large two-sided buffet line almost the entire diameter of the space with a portion of the radius too ( can you picture this geometry geeks ?!?! ) There's a portion of the dining area providing a nice few of the strip/vegas valley. A rather large tv/video screen area on the surrounding radius wall that advertises the resort, provides the dinner buffet menu and food facts - ,kinda neat. \n\nThe food - not a huge selection, but decent ( cost - i believe $7.50 ) \nThe highlights - carved to order smoked bacon - very good ! \nin the pastry section they had fruit fritters - crunchy outside, moist inside - had a rich taste to it - EXCELLENT ! \n\nThe mexican foods - nice spice, good flavor ( enchiladas and the smoke sausage ) \n\nService - very good but the place was slow. \n\nlowlights - no id cards for the food items ( but there's a large # of employees to ask what's what ) \n\nno pineapple - I LOVE FRESH PINEAPPLE \n\nno desserts - but they were getting them ready for the lunch buffet - why you gotta tease me ?!?!? \n\nI loved the list of foods for the dinner buffet - i will definitely try soon !"
1,Had the ciopinno and risotto. Very nice flavor! It is run by Romans who were very friendly and accommodating. The price was reasonable. I would go back again!
0,"I will make this short. I love sushi and this was the worst, most flavorless sushi I have ever had. I guess I have been spoiled by Hana's Japanese Eatery and the freshness and quality there. I did enjoy the cocktail which was called the Ahsosuki."
0,"Embarrassed money was spent here .  Upon arrival I watch guests be greeted by a pair of associates attached at the hip who couldn't put away a healthy convo to fully crowd control or build any real warm welcomes.  Finally in a crowded store with plenty of payroll used I found my self wandering the store for a mirror to try on apparel and to my dismay none and none of that American customer service of five point guest augmentation.  As a friend begged left and right for service or even to get full eye contact to grab a size ,the ten plus sales staff seem to be no where in sight.  Can this be Loss Prevention approved?  Finally the shoe came out an asian dude who just could have cared less who had no product knowledge or passion could careless to make the sell stood there making one think am I bothering you? My bad!! I watched a store with ten people scurry around like ants but no leader to be found to give any direction.  This is LV ! High volume your brand and demographic are here ,so why is your customer service that of some Santa Ana factory outlet store? Come on guys!!!"
1,"AMAZING!!!!! love love love this place!! I went for my first time yesterday and it was the most wonderful experience! My stylist was the sweetest, such fun and did an amazing job with my hair. The salon is adorable and they pay great attention to the little things. I was offered a glass if wine when I came in, they had snacks out and about a million magazines, which is exactly what I needed coming right from work! Couldn't be happier to have found this place!"
0,We ended up going elsewhere...just could not get their act together.
0,"Same thing as Dennys at almost twice the price. Marginally decent food and service.  It was clean and food was pretty quick, even with a nearly full restaurant. Parking is horrendous when all the places there are busy."
0,"There were so many problems with our stay.  I do not wish to spend an undue amount of time discussing it, so here's some bullet points.  \n- The staff were universally unfriendly and unhelpful, causing serious complications in our time and energy.\n- Our room was not cleaned in the 48 hours we stayed there.\n- We were given the incorrect room (two twin beds instead of a king bed). \n- We could hear a loud buzzing all night from inadequately shielded electronics outside our room.\n- The floor in our room was bowed so that the two twin beds sloped inwards, meaning that when we were laying down, whoever was towards the more-center of the bed would risk rolling off the bed if not careful.  \n\nWhen we arrived, we had twenty minutes to make it to our show (Cirque Du Soliel - Mystique), which we already had tickets for.  It was either make it or loose the $200 spent on tickets.  I arrived with my ID and reservation number ready, but instead of being given our room keys, we were almost denied stay, even though I had made the reservation over three months prior, because the hotel had already redeemed the groupon we'd used.  As they'd already redeemed it, I couldn't find the groupon number for them when they demanded I give it to them again when we were checking in!  A manager had to be called to finally clear up the situation with the extremely rude and unhelpful woman at check-in, and the manager finally gave us our room keys; we made it to the show only because a taxi-cab driver was willing to speed to get us there on time!\n\nIt was told to the staff that we were visiting for our honeymoon.  OUR HONEYMOON, celebrating our recent marriage.  That guests would visit a place to celebrate such an important point in their lives should be a point of pride.  Instead, we were treated as vagabonds.  \n\nWe received the room through a groupon, but I will be contacting groupon to request a refund and report the truly terrible experience we had here.  \n\nWe will not be returning to the Riviera."
0,"This place is ALWAYS dead! The fullest I've ever seen it is every seat at the bar (roughly 20 seats) plus maybe a couple tables. The only reason I'm willing to come here is because I have stupid friends that like this place. The only positive is their \""Street Tacos\"" that I like... Which are cheap.\n\nOverall, this place is at the bottom of the fun list... If you get pulled here, get their \""Street Tacos!\"""
0,"So I just played all three of these courses, eagle crest, palm valley and highland falls and it couldn't have been a worst experience. Eagle Crest had no drinking water anywhere, slow greens, mediocre fairways and overall just a really short simple course. Worth 40 bucks? i think not. I stopped midway to get a quick bite to eat and asked for a cup of ice water. The lady served me a cup full with black dusty things in it. I told her and her response was \""yes, that's from the ice, and we can't do anything about it unfortunately\"" ....seriously? what is this mexico? i may have expected this at some crummy run down course on the east side of vegas but i thought this was summerlin? WOW, how about not serve it if it is full of black things? So she takes the cup and refills it and tells me \""there is less black stuff in this one\""...i can't make this kind of shit up. She made sure to fill me up with 1$ bills after i paid to ensure herself a tip..it didn't work though. \nThis is my review of Eagle Crest, my review of Highland falls is much worst. I am not some person who sits around complaining because i have enjoyed several courses in Vegas and would never complain about them. \nWould i ever play here again? hell no, and i would advise the same for everyone else."
1,Everything you could want from a buffet!
1,"Dr Brooker is one of the most thorough, patient and detailed people I have ever met. Not just Doctor's. Being a person who wanted to improve eyesight through Lasik technology, it was a process to get my eyes in position to benefit from the procedure. Dr Brooker delicately walked me through this process for several months. he was clear about all the benefits and more importantly risks associated. \n\nAlso something to note, personally I never felt and pressure from Dr Brooker and felt his sole purpose was to educate and guide me through the process of maintaining healthy eyes.\n\nHe's more than a 5 star.\n\nNevada"
0,"I arrive and like at most places on the phone... The place is pretty much empty for a Sunday night being right across from a light rail station. I ask the waitress to seat me on a couch and I follow and continue my important phone conversation. The restaurant is located below some loft in central phoenix and has an urban contemporary concrete feel to it. There is a full menu but I focus in on the cheese and wine menu. I order the three-cheese sampler and a glass of wine, a medium red from Santa Monica California. The wine is smooth and the cheeses flavorful and after waiting 20 minutes for it to arrive I guess prune juice and cardboard would have been just as  flavorful. I guess good cheese takes time to cut. The decor was a bit mixed matched with concrete grays and pastel curtains. I felt like I was more in an Austin Powers flick than in a hip wine bar. The wait for service was considerable considering that the place was one third full. The bill came out to more than $50 bucks, I would say a little pricey for the wasting my time; it took a couple minutes for my eyes to adjust when I left.  I kept seeing pastel shower curtains everywhere!"
1,"The BEST Filibertos, and I've eaten at them all as well as the *berto clones.  The meat never tastes like cat unlike at some of them and it's open 24 hours, inside too!  The condiment bar is always stocked with fresh peppers, tomatoes, salsa, guacamole, etc and they actually get my orders right first try.  If you do go late you may encounter a line at the drive through because it's a hoppin place after everything else closes."
1,"I had to try this place from recommendations from a fellow co-worker.  the outside is very underestimating as the inside is on a whole other level. It is comfy, cozy, and the music is awesome. keeps a positive train of thought as you wait for your pizza. the wait was long but expected as they make the pizza right in front of you.. Literally they have a glass wall and you can watch them make the pizza. I had no problems waiting as the final product was ridiculous! ! we had the 18\"" with cheese, eggplant, caramelized onions, sauteed mushrooms, roasted garlic, pepperoni, and olives. along with their garlic rosemary knots. the pizza was great, the marinara sauce was very flavorful but not overpowering.  the mozzarella cheese tasted fresh, the toppings were very flavorful and did not disappoint at all! pizza was on another level from others ive tried in my opinion and is highly recommended. the garlic rosemary knots are awesome. the knots are a bit dense and tough but after all it is a knot lol! but I didnt mind as the garlic and rosemary was very intense and was a great surprise as the knots ive had around town fall way short on the flavor category, not these though! They are perfect and a must try with their pizza. oh I also ordered their cannoli and I am currently waiting to try them as I am stuffed!! we finished half the pizza and there was two of us and I am satisfied! ! if you like pizza and havent tried this place, put your usual pizza spot on hold for once and go here it will not dissapoint!!\n\nUpdate: so I had the cannoli!  It was good. It did however taste like a twist on what a canoli im used to taste like. It has the look. The shell is good and crispy, very dense shell. The filling to me tasted like a cream cheese/ cinnamon cream filling. It was good, just not what I expected. Try it out and let me know what you all think??"
1,Really nice outdoor patio. Sunday drink special on whiskey was really good. Very reasonable price for uptown. Nice variations on Irish cuisine.  Worth checking out!
1,"Sat at the bar because of the wait but the service was good, the food was awesome and the cocktails were on point. I would definitely return or recommend"
0,"Like so many others, we went here because Hot and Juicy had a forty minute wait...BIG mistake!!\n\nThe service was awful:\n~ waiter forgot our \""Cajun\"" fries\n~ our order came out with at least 10 minutes between everyone's dishes\n~ the waiter's English got shaky when we asked which flavor our shrimp were and complained about a mix up\n\nAlthough the shrimp are bigger, they don't compare to the bag of goodness the waitstaff delivers at the REAL crawfish place! Hot and Juicy is worth the wait...don't waste your time wit bad imitations"
1,"Call me a criminal, but I don't like Vegas.  The only reason why I travel there several times a year is because my sister and her family live there.  And the Pinball Hall of Fame is in Vegas.  I usually stay at Boulder Station now because it's close to my sister's house.  And they have bingo every odd hour.\n\nIt's a quiet hotel/casino.  Definitely more for the locals and the Laughlin crowd.  But that's fine by me.  I don't particularly care for the insanity of the Strip.  When I'm not in LA, I like to get away from traffic and people!  \n\nIt's affordable too.  \n\nThe rooms are comfortable, they offer room service, and there is security at the entrance to the hotel tower at night so no local crazies have access to kill you in your sleep."
0,"I can't even believe I'm reviewing a Buffalo Wild Wings. You are all witnessing what can only be described as a low point in my Yelping. Ugh, ok, let's just get this over with.\n\nFirst of all, why did I even come here? Because it was Friday night and my family wanted to go out and my dad hates any place with live music, crowds, noise, and \""lots of energy.\"" So Buffalo Wild Wings is the perfect place to go if you hate people and fun, basically. And my brother wanted to go here because they have trivia, which by the way is also not fun because if I am one thing I am fucking competitive and I hate losing and will go out of my way to try to ruin the fun for everyone else if I do. Also the game itself is full of either esoteric questions or totally obvious ones and if you wait long enough they give you the answer. Total bullshit. \n\nOh so the restaurant itself I'm pretty sure is segregated. The hostess insisted that we sit at the bar even though the front dining area had plenty of tables open because she said there were only two waitresses for that area and they were already busy. So we walked through there and pretty much everybody was black. The bar had some people in it and (you should expect this if you've been reading carefully) they were all white. Probably a total coincidence. I'm not really sure but I'd guess Yelp might frown upon such a nonchalant accusation of segregation.\n\nThe only other time I've been to a Buffalo Wild Wings was in high school when I went with my friend Katie and these twins, Greg and whatever the gay one's name was. All I remember from that was the twins were really hot and I had a thing for Greg and didn't find out until January when I visited Katie in Brooklyn that a) Greg is her roommate now and b) he totally had a thing for me, too. So when we reunited we hella made out and I know my ex-boyfriend doesn't read this but if he does I might as well come clean about also making out with 3 other guys early on in our relationship because that's what you get when you date me for 5 months and refuse to acknowledge me as your girlfriend, asshole! This entire paragraph has nothing to do with this restaurant but whatever if I want to use Yelp as my diary I DAMN WILL. \n\nSo anyway we ordered like 25 wings for the table and I'll just cut to the chase, they sucked. I asked the waitress if they had anything that they didn't deep fry and she replied, \""Everything is fried.\"" So I ate all this fried greasy food and felt horrible and my old college/post-college/occasionally current bulimia habit kicked in because I just didn't want that shit in my body. That is how bad Buffalo Wild Wings is. Fuck now I wish I would not have told my mom about Yelp because she reads my reviews now I guess. She said some of them are funny. SOME OF THEM?? She also says I'm \""too sarcastic so that I can sound edgy\"" and to that I say you may be right but Yelp reviews are the only things keeping me from pulling the trigger on the Beretta I put to my forehead every night before bed, so just let me do this the way I want. Man, that was really dark. Now THAT'S edgy!\n\nWow what the hell was I even talking about? Oh yeah, I didn't like the wings here."
1,"Super cheap and relatively large portions.  Overall, a good place to grab a quick bite to eat for lunch or dinner.  none of the dishes were mind blowing, but definitely better than some of the other places located by China Town..."
0,"we went to this place recently because their menu is predominantly Shawarma. They have steak and chicken Shawarma. The problem is it isn't Shawarma. True Shawarma is meat whether it be chicken, Lamb or beef marinated with the appropriate spices for about 12+ hours. I ordered the steak Shawarma. It was not marinated and therfore was not Shawarma. My wife ordered the chicken Shawarma and it was not marinated but a very plainly cooked chicken. They didnt even use salt and pepper. My steak Shawarma was doused with Tzatziki. It tasted ok but we were really looking forward to some real authentix Shawarma. Another thing that was odd was they didnt even offer gyros on their menu...wtf!? The women working there were ok but when we got up to leave they didnt say goodbye or thanks for coming in...nada nothing zip. They were just hanging out and chatting. The only plus was that the place is very clean and neat and we didnt have to wait becuase we were the only ones there. Also the rice and salad that come with the Shawarma meals is bland like cardboard. Very little rice and no dressing for the salad. Other Mediterranean restaurants really hook you up with the rice but not this place. Barely a serving of rice actually. So in summation if your looking for real Shawarma stay away from this place. Im sure there's much better out there."
1,"Culinary Adventure #2 in Phx went MUCH MUCH better than #1. \n\nThis is a place my dad frequents, and kept talking about all day so I was eager to give it a shot. As we were driving up I noticed it was in a stripmall-esque area and I was like \""Daaaad...why always the strip mall places\"". But as soon as we got in - definitely a different atmosphere than I expected. The front area is a decent bar and a waiting area; the TV in the corner was showing the ASU/UofA Bball game. There were about 4 tables full in there but it was after 8pm on a Wednesday so, I didn't hold that against them at all. \n\nEveryone knew my dad and greeted our table with warm smiles. Some quips about the Cards and we ordered; my dad pretty much knew what was good so we went with that. \n\nBread was awesome - a nuttier bread which I am always a fan of. Get the garlic butter to spread on - mmmm. We got a 'special' meal that my dad concocted that he's evidently had there numerous times - grilled (not breaded) eggplant, and a side of penne with peppers/mushrooms in an al diavolo sauce. Very good. The sauce was especially spectacular. \n\nThe service was nice - attentive yet not intrusive. Best. After clearing our plates and bringing out dessert, they brought over some amaretto on the rocks 'to wash down our meal'. What a nice touch!\n\nI had nothing bad to say about this place, except for I don't think people know much about it since it's tucked into a stripmall next to (I think) a dry cleaner or some other inane business. Highly recommended and I will definitely be back the next time I'm in Phx!"
1,"I recently stayed here for 3 nights. The room was quite large with a king bed and a sitting area with a fold out couch and a table with chairs. Large TV. Very large bathroom with 2 sinks and a separate toilet/shower area.  There was even a phone in there!  Small refrigerator, nice sized closet. View overlooking the golf course. Bed was a little firm for my taste. The room was very nice and clean. Very quiet in the rooms, even at night.  Workout facility is clean. Casino has nice updated machines. Parking in the garage is easy. Even went to the movies, was surprised that the movie ticket price was comparable to other theaters."
1,"we ate there this past saturday evening. arrived in time to take advantage of the 50% off wine price, which was great.  they have an extensive offering of wines, with emphasis on chilean and argentinian. delicious. ordered the fig/prosciutto salad that was wonderful. my companion ordered the salami/proscuitto/olive plate that came with bread and crackers. he ordered sangria. everything was very tasty. we sat outside. the atmosphere is so welcoming. had a great waiter. really enjoyed ourselves. we will absolutely go back."
1,"I went in August 2011 for a 60 minute Swedish Massage, and it was A-FRICKIN-MAZING!!!!!  I would swear, but I don't want to offend anyone.  Nycole was simple amazing, she made me drool.  Her pressure points were spot on and she was able to make  the most of the time.  I actually forgot where I was a couple times.  I was relaxed and rejuvenated and I felt like a different person when I left.  I will go back the next time I visit.  Worth every penny spent."

1,"I thoroughly enjoyed my time at Cabana at the Pointe. In the Phoenix area, it is one of the safer, more affordable complexes on the market. Specifically, it hit on the key items I was looking for in an apartment complex:\n\nAffordability - Great prices for what you receive, especially considering the location. Right near the 51, and a short drive from anywhere in Scottsdale, or Downtown Phoenix.\n\nCleanliness - The grounds were always kept clean, the pool was sparkling and there was never any trash around whatsoever.\n\nMaintenance - They have a new online maintenance system that allows you to report any broken items in your apartment, and they will come fix them asap. The day after I submitted a request, it was tagged, fixed and a note was left in my apartment. Very convenient!\n\nSafety - Nighttime security and a very quiet, safe complex.\n\nOffice Staff - Helpful, friendly and informative. Shout out to Jillian for always having a smile on her face and a ready-to-help attitude.\n\nAmenities - Covered parking spaces, multiple laundry locations, multiple mailbox locations, clean pool and small workout facility. All great as advertised.\n\nIf you are reading through apartment reviews, take this one seriously and head over to Cabana at the Pointe for a visit. Everything checks out as advertised, and they're dedicated to making your stay a good one!"
0,"Items Selected:\nRed Velvet Cupcake\nCarrot Cake Cupcake\nCake Batter Cupcake\nDrumstick Cupcake\nGooey Bar\n\nLocated in a less than stellar looking strip-mall just off the 215 nearing the Veterans Memorial Highway and demarcated by a sign that simply reads \""Cupcake Caf\u00e9 Bakery\"" it was in acknowledging that dessert was unlikely to be a part of dinner plans at Raku that I stopped in to Lil' Brown Sugar and greeted by the smell of industrial cleanser rather than cinnamon and sugar on entering the door I nearly turned tail to the run, the festive d\u00e9cor and overall distance from home eventually convincing me to stay despite the fact that not a soul was to be seen until a young woman emerged from the back nearly three minutes later.\n\nUndoubtedly a mom n' pop spot, complete with pictures of the family alongside their children on the walls, Lil' Brown Sugar's menu is a rather concise collection of eight small-sized cupcakes plus a few treats priced at $1-3 apiece and opting to sample nearly half of the collection to the tune of just under thirteen dollars the results were a mixed bag at best - the St. Louis style Gooey Bar undoubtedly the best of the quintet with ample notes of butter oozing forth beneath a topcoat baked to a crispy flake.\n\nSitting down to snap some photos and sample Red Velvet that ate more like a frosted breakfast muffin than a moist dessert 'cake' before taking the glut of my bounty to the road it was just after dinner that I finally indulged in the rest of my selections and beginning with carrot cake fared featured good texture but not enough spice beneath sugary cream cheese it was finally in the simple \""cake batter\"" that could more simply be named \""Vanilla\"" that an overall impressive cupcake was found, the up-front sweetness serving to accentuate the vanilla rather than overshadow it while also pairing well with coffee, the same not to be said of Lil' Brown Sugar's signature \""drumstick\"" that returned to the dry mouthfeel of the Red Velvet as notes of what I can only assume to be cheap cocoa powder got lost beneath thick frosting, chocolate drizzle, and peanuts plus an off-kilter ice cream cone.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Hedging my bets and guessing that some of the dryness delivered by both chocolate options was due to my late time of arrival and unlikelihood of items being baked more than once during the day, there are simply far better options for baked goods throughout Sin City and while some may think that cupcakes are entirely pass\u00e9 a simple look at the business generated at Sprinkles, Retro, and Gimme Some Sugar will clearly indicate otherwise...the fact is that Lil' Brown Sugar simply isn't that good."
0,"Not a fan. The service when we went was passable, but only from the waitress. The kitchen delayed all our food because they messed up a steak (seriously, how do you mess up a steak?) which meant that everything we ate was cold. From what I can tell it wouldn't be bad warm- I had the stromboli, which was passable as is- but when you mess up that badly, it's hard to make fans.\n\nAlso, unrelated, the wine seemed rather expensive. Maybe that's just me, though."
1,"This bar is home! Many years ago my husband and I heard about Frankies but on our first visit to Vegas we were unable to find time to visit Frankies.  However on our next trip to Sin City we made it a point to get a drink and collectors mug! A few years ago my hubby flew in for a job interview and met some internet friends in person at Frankies!  Both the bar and our friends continue to delight and amaze us! Order a Zombie if you aren't driving!  The Scurvy and The Thurston Howl are interesting drinks! The Scurvy is a bit on the bitter side, while the Thurston is sweet and kind!!!!"
1,"I had a friend who was doing hot yoga and raved about how much she enjoyed it.  When a groupon came along for ten sessions I couldn't resist.  Yes it is hot.  Not AZ hot but like steamy jungles of South America hot!  In just a few sessions I could really see and feel that my body was changing.  My groupon is used up, but I am still going to Sumits.\n\nWhat I appreciate is that you determine how hard you are working.  The staff encourage you to listen to your body in determining how much or little you do during any one session.  The staff also offers gentle corrections on posses so you don't injure yourself.  \n\nMen and women attend the classes.  Guys don't be intimidated thinking its a chick thing.  There are lots of guys who attend.\n\nTIPS:\nDrink lots of water day of practice.  A lot!  You will be sweating like you never have before and it is very easy to get dehydrated.\n\nDon't eat anything for a least of couple of hours prior to the class.\n\nIf you are not sure what kind of mat or towel to get, you can rent them at the front desk.  They are good quality and very sanitary.\n\nDress for comfort.  Every part of you will be soaked thru with sweat.  Think of that when determining what you are wearing.  Many of the ladies will wear Yoga Capris and a long sports tank.  Wearing a tee-shirt was too distracting to me as it would bunch up and stick."
0,Wal-Mart will rip you off if your are using there family mobile cell plan. and If you try to CXL they will even get more from you. Beware. When I called to CXL they said my Extra pack funds will be lost they will just keep them for there pockets. and to top it off they also charged $5.00 to make the payment over the phone. Buyer be where if you are using there cell plan.
1,"I'd fly back to Vegas just for the Truffle pasta. It was a pasta of the day, and what a glorious, glorious day that was. Er, two days (it was THAT good). I cant even remember anything else we ate (it was all delish) because we were in a heavenly like, orgasmic state. We might not have even talked the entire meal, other than about how great the pasta was. It's very likely at the top of my last meal on earth list. I love you, truffle pasta. You are the pasta of my life."
1,"For me Eddie V's never disappoints.  Fantastic service, incredible food, great choices, terrific atmosphere... this is now my go-to place for an overall grand experience.  They offer Valet parking which I love... nothing worse than getting all dressed up and having to walk 2 blocks to get to your destination.  It is $3 plus tip... just an FYI.  We always make reservations just to be sure we'll get in.  If the tables not ready they have a very nice bar area to enjoy a cocktail while you wait.  Both times recently our table was ready even though we arrived a bit early so we just sat down.  Service is A+, first class all the way.  You can just relax and enjoy your dinner.  Things I love, Sea Bass!  OMG it is wonderful!  If you like Sea Bass... get it.  It is a huge portion and its usually market price...  Last time I ordered it was $35 which I thought very reasonable considering the portion size.  Very easily shared by two with smaller appetites. Sorry... back to appetizers... Oyster lovers love the oysters here!  they are on the happy hour menu in the bar area.  Yellowtail sashimi is OMG to die for.  Heirloom tomato salad was fantastic too.  Filet always a good choice... The asparagus was cooked to perfection and I would choose the augratin potatoes over the twice baked.  Ive had both and I prefer mashed or baked usually but these augratin are wow... really great.  The Sole is super!  It is a HUGE portion so unless you are a big eater or you are sharing... there is too much to eat but its prepared to a T!  It has a crispy exterior due to the parmasan crusting... and its delish!  Oh and if you order a steak... you can order any way, any sauce, peppered, etc.... pretty much it seems if you ask they most likely can do.  Just the way you like it! They also have live jazz playing in the bar area... very nice touch."
1,"I started watching ASU games at Sun Devil Stadium back in high school -  back in the early 80s.  I've seen some of the greatest games in this stadium during Rose Bowl runs in the 80s and 90s (nothing compares to the site of goal posts marching down 5th Ave after OT win over USC) and Arizona Cardinals games.  I've also been to the Coliseum in Los Angeles for USC vs UCLA football games and here's my thoughts on Sun Devil Stadium...\n\nThe stadium has evolved over the years but it's still the same classic venue it's always been, complete with bathtub urinals.  Everything's asphalt around the stadium and it's quite a hike to the upper deck seats or even the top of the lower deck seats, especially from 5th Ave., as the entire stadium is built on a pair of mountains.  C'mon, admit it!  It's one of the coolest placements of a stadium... ever!\n\nWorst thing about the stadium in my opinion is simply that it's outdoors.  It's crazy hot in the \""fall\"" when ASU starts playing and it's frigid (to us Phoenicians) in the winter, especially after dark with a breeze blowing in the upper deck.  Brrrr!  Spoiled are we with indoor Dbax and Cardinals stadiums.\n\nThis is certainly one of my favorite places to take my teen/preteen kids.  They find the stadium very interesting, though they always whine about the hike up to the stands.  College games are always a different experience than the pros. Very energetic crowds before during and after games."
0,"I really, really wanted to like Over Easy. \n\nThe space looked cool. It was recommended to me by a friend.\n\nI decided to take my girlfriend there one Sunday morning.\n\nI was surprised.  My food seemed slopped together, but I ate it.\n\nThe worst part was my girlfriend's experience. \n\nShe ordered lox and cream cheese.  Of course, we both thought that they would include a bagel or bread of some kind...NO.  They gave her two pieces of lox, a glop of cream cheese and three pieces of cold asparagus.\nShe looked at me and said, \""What am I supposed to do with this?\""  She ate it, but was repelled by asparagus for the next month.\n\nJust say no....."
1,"I admit I'm usually the 1st to try to go cheap on repairs...NO MORE!\nVince treated me like a Queen, the waiting room and bathrooms are photo worthy and it didn't cost much more than the non-dealer shops all the way in Central Phoenix that couldn't get to my car for 4-5 days. Did I mention my air conditioner stopped working and it's 111 degrees outside?\n\nThanks Chapman!!! Give Vince a raise."
1,"For four more months now my local Walmart here has been well managed, so it's time to scoot them up to 4 Stars.  I'm getting shopping carts that work properly, finding the things I need IN STOCK & neatly placed, associates are reasonably easy to find with a question, responding satisfactorily, and checkout is ok.\n\nYay!     :-))"
0,"Do NOT go to this Chili's location. The service has been consistently HORRIBLE. \n\nA couple of weeks ago my boyfriend and I tried to call in an order. The guy answered and left us on hold so we decided to go ahead and head that way while we were on hold. Well....we were LITERALLY on hold for 17 mins and were STILL on hold when we got there. \n\nWe walked in and not a single soul greeted us. The same waitress looked at us and didnt say anything 3 different times. So...we sat down and waited on someone to greet us. A guy finally came over and asked if someone had assisted us yet. We asked for a manager. (Before the guy came over...another couple with their kid came in and stood there and NO ONE greeted them either. we told them we had been waiting 10 mins and no one greeted us so they walked out.)\n\nThe manager finally came over and we showed her the phone screen (yes, we were still on hold). She apologized and cooked our food for us and gave it to us free, drink included.\n\nOk so we went again this past Tuesday evening and it wasn't very crowded. My boyfriend placed the order again and asked to subsitute shrimp for broccoli in our pasta because we are vegetarians. We got there, 5 mins after they said our food would be ready and it still wasn't ready. We got our food and left (shouldve listened to my intuition telling me to check the food). Got to the house....our pasta was dry as hell and the \""steamed\"" broccoli was raw broccoli sitting on top of our pasta. NEVER AGAIN. I'm disgusted with this place. The 2 stars was only because the first time they messed up the manager cooked the food very well."

0,"I am writing this review based on what just occured between my co-worker and the supposed manager of this restaurant. My coworker ordered pho (take out) and when she opened the container and sifted through the pho, there was a bug. To ANYONE this has happened to (or even if it hasn't) this is incredibly disgusting to discover in your food.\n\nShe called to let them know what happend and was going to come back to get her money, when the \""manager\"" told her they didn't want her business and it wasn't their problem.\n\nThis is ABSOLUTELY unacceptable.  And it gets worse. My co-worker went back with another co-worker to bring the pho back so they could see for themselves and when they walked in, the container cracked/opened and the bag was filled with the pho, to which the manager said/yelled to them, \""get that sh*t out of here. I don't want it\"". He proceeded to argue with my coworkers and raise his voice in the restaurant. (while other customers were present)\n\nTHAT is how you run your business? Yelling AND swearing at a female customer in the middle of your restaurant because she brought to your attention your pho was insect ridden!?  \n\nGET THE HELL out of here.  DISGUSTING, and I (along with MANY MANY MANY employess that work downtown and used to go to this restaurant), will NEVER be back.\n\nYou are TRASH for speaking to a customer this way. \n\nSo if in fact the manager was involved with this encounter, I hope your doors soon close. And if this happened to be an employee posing as a manger, then I hope you lose your job and the real manager make drastic changes in the kitchen as well as your hiring process."
0,"This is just for the crab Rangoon dip and service. What was once one of our favorite appetizers tasted stretched aka watered down. You used to could taste the crab and creaminess. Price has increased which is fine provided you do not skimp on ingredients. Also the service this time was not as attentive  as we have received in the past. We are still fans and will continue to come and enjoy all the other tasty sushi, burgers and appetizers minus this dip. :)"

All by 3 separate waiters ' here to serve me'. \nThe staff did not know what they were doing. \n\nThey also told me they had no tables till 10pm, yet the restaraunt was just about empty when we got there. \n\nMorton would be highly disappointed."
0,"Gardunos seemed to be the casino coffee shop equivalent of a Mexican restaurant at the Palms.  This place was mediocre at best. The service was pretty slow, especially considering how unbusy the place was.  The waiter seemed completely disinterested in serving us.  To top it all off, my burrito was saltier than the dead sea!\n\nYes, they have a salsa bar, so what?  So does Rubios and Baja Fresh.  The tortilla chips weren't good enough to get a second helping.  The only reason why I could tell they weren't from a bag was because they were too oily.\n\nIf you go here, I'd stick to the bar for drinks and maybe a few appetizers.\n\nTip: When you're eating the chips and salsa, you have to yell \""gard-UNO!\"" when there is just one chip left."
1,"I came here for my birthday and it just so happens to be a Mexican holiday so I guess the buffet price was a bit more than usual. I came at 2:30pm on a Saturday and paid $55. I had to wait in line for about an hour. \n\nWhen I finally got seated, my friends and I didn't know where to start! There was soo many selections and everything looked delicious! I went for the king crabs and oysters! They tasted so fresh and easy to eat.\nI ate my money worth here and my favorite part was the dessert section! They had macarons and ice cream, and you can even make your own crepe! I was so full from eating all the food but always have room for dessert. \nThis place did not disappoint. I would defiantly come here again and try some other foods that I didn't get to try."
1,"XO Chinese food is awesome. For take out, i cant recommend a better place. My personel favorite dish is the pineapple shrimp fried rice. Prices are great and they deliver fast. Thumbs up to XO!"
1,"Sprouts is like the love child of Whole Foods and Trader Joe's. It offers more of the all-around grocery store like Whole Foods, but offers prices similar to Trader Joe's, and exhibits the healthy, all-natural, organic products that both Whole Foods and Trader Joe's capitalize on.\n\nSprouts has recently become my primary grocery store mainly because of the produce section. The fruits, veggies, and herbs Sprouts offers are always fresh, in great shape, and usually cost less than other stores. I'm also in love with the quinoa with dried cranberries their deli has ready for me (well, anyone).  Sprouts also has a meat counter with seafood and a lovely bulk selection.\n\nBottom line: cheaper than Whole Foods, more selection than Trader Joe's."
1,"I have been here twice and it was excellent both times.  Great atmosphere.  Attentive service, but not overly so.  Good wine and drink list.  I had the scallops as an entr\u00e9e both times.  Delicious!  Tried a variety of the appetizers.  All excellent!  Definitely a top choice in Charlotte."
1,This is my favorite place to eat.  Be sure to order the cilantro house dressing and put it on whatever it is you order.  I prefer the pork over the chicken or steak.  If you order the tostada with a soft tortilla you will get the perfect size version of a cafe Rio salad for a much smaller price point.  The regular size salads are huge!  My kids live this place too.
1,"I am flying United today out of McCarran and just found there's a new lounge in the D Gates!  So excited!  I have a Priority Pass membership, so I have free access to select lounges, and this is one of them.  I chatted with the staff... they've been open since June, and there's one in the new terminal as well.  It's a small lounge, but they have a decent beer selection (Asahi!) and some unique snacks (pita chips & hummus).  Friendly staff, free wifi, and a FANTASTIC view overlooking the concourse where people arrive from the shuttle.  This may be my favorite airport lounge yet."
0,"Horrendous from beginning to end, I had an appointment for 8:00 AM to get lab work done, it was 1 hr and 15 minutes after my appointment time before I was called back, close to 3 people who came in after me went before me. The place itself is dirty, crowded, and noisy. \n\nI wonder what is the point of making an appointment when it still takes over an hour to get in? There was a man who came in without one and they told him it would take an hour. So really what is the point?"

1,"What a great place for dinner! It's nice to dine at a place that's fancy enough and welcomes children at the same time.  They were very flexible about our reservation and service was prompt, courteous, and attentive.  \n\nFor starters, my husband had oysters and I had the sardines (of course!).  Dinner for me were mussels and frites which were very addictive to eat and my husband had the mahi-mahi.  And yes...we fed our children and they had buttered orrichiette. We skipped dessert but I'm sure that would've been good too.  Does this have better food than Nostranos?  Maybe...but what this place had was a welcoming atmosphere which is more than I can say about the pretentious ambience at Nostranos!"
1,A great place for a light dinner before heading out for the night. Reasonably priced and intimate decor. Food portions are appropriate and rich mango juice. Enjoy!
1,"For the first time we decided to try out \""family Vegas\"", could Vegas still be a blast with a baby?  It started with finding the right accommodations and we certainly found it with the two bedroom suite a ph towers.  So for a young family visiting Vegas I liked:\n- attached to mall, easy access to food that many of the hotels don't have.\n- walking through mall to get to your room is much better than a stinky smoky casino.\n- crib for the baby, arrived promptly on request, free of charge.\n- giant projection tv which for a change we actually used when babysitting the little one...a very smart addition to the room.\n- modern decor, one of the newer hotels in Vegas and it shows, very nice.\n- the price, 290 for 2 bedrooms, very reasonable.  One of the few hotels in Vegas that is set up to have what actually is a two bedroom suite (not just two ones with a door).\n\nDidn't like:\n- the service was a bit spotty, either very prompt and friendly or nonexistent.  I've come to lower my expectations a lot when it comes to service in hotels in Vegas, competition is cutthroat, room prices are dirt cheap, and they are cutting back on staff and customer service to survive.  If customer service is very important to you I suggest you check out one of the higher end hotels in Vegas (mandarin oriental?).\n\nWill definitely consider returning here...if I'm not tempted by one of the other great spots like cosmopolitan or aria"
0,"Never order a sandwich from a.place with \""Pizza\"" in the name. The beef in my sandwich was good, but the bread was soggy and gross. I ordered fries but got chips. After 20 minutes I'm STILL waiting for fries with no update from my server. It isn't even busy in here. Not too pleased.\n\n(EDIT) - Later on my sandwich was so soggy that the bread ripped in half and all the fillings fell out. Grr. No more Nello's for me~"
1,"David is the MAN! He is awesome, professional, and did a fabulous job. What else would you want in a painter? I had David refurbish/paint an old Vintage dresser. He helped me select a white linen paint and his expertise went a long way! The dresser came out looking retro, clean, and fresh. It was exactly what I wanted. He is also very reasonably priced. All the other quotes I received were over $300 more than what David charged. He is also cool to chat with and is trustworthy. Pretty much as good as it gets!"
0,"Madison Sole is largely forgettable on the State St. walk because it only caters to one crowd: women, and it does that only mediocrely at best. The shoes are generally extremely overpriced and not all that cute looking either; though, I did manage to find a pair of flip-flops for a decent amount ($29 down from $99--less than what I found for a decent pair at another place on State St.)\n\nThe service here is mediocre, too. When I went in, the two clerks were busy gossiping over another employee for at least 15 minutes before they realized someone had been in the store. When I got in, they clucked about a pair I was wearing and how \""comfortable\"" it was.\n\nI got it home and the large blister on my feet from the strap is a testament otherwise. This isn't a bad place, but there's a lot better on State St., even if it's more money."
0,"This burger joint operates in the Green Valley Ranch Casino and is a Fatburger franchise.  Now Fatburger is renowned in California for their juicy delicious burgers.  However their reputation does NOT translate to the Green Valley Ranch Casino location.  I went there about a month ago and asked for a medium large fatburger, hold the relish and mayo.  The mayo and relish were held however the burger came as a salty grossly overcooked piece of meat, more tasteless than the inexpensive major burger chains and cost $11.45.  I was shocked.  I recently returned and placed the same order for a large fatburger medium rare.  The waitress said fine.  Again to my surprise I received an overcooked burger loaded with salt. A piece of shoe leather would have been more appetizing!!  Again I paid $11.45.  Two times is enough for me.  This place is the WORST and does not come close to living up to the Fatburger standards. This franchise needs to be closed. You would do better and cheaper eating at any other burger joint in Las Vegas and there are many."

1,"I'm forever in search of my \""dream handyman\"" and now I think I've found him (knock on the wood). After several years of disappointing experiences with handymen, I started to believe that there is no such thing as a good handyman.  Thanks to Yelp (and \""no\"" this is not a advertisement for Yelp) I'm hopeful that I've finally found my \""go to\"" man for repairs big and small. I called Troy in a time of desperation, needing to get several repairs to my home before my renters moved in.  He arrived in the morning, worked for eight straight hours, and checked off everything on my list.  When I discovered a few more things, he returned within a few days, and finished those jobs as well. Troy seems committed to saving clients money whenever possible ... based on my experience with him. He bills hourly, works fast and his rate is reasonable. Based on his service, and all of his positive reviews on Yelp, I'm sure Troy must be a very busy handyman, but somehow he still made me feel like a \""preferred\"" client.  I rarely post reviews on Yelp, but in this case, a rave review is definitely in order.  Thanks Troy!"
0,Pretty basic Chinese food. Ok if you're in a hurry and want a quick meal. Do NOT order the hot tea unless you're willing to pay $4/person!! You won't find out until you get the bill...
1,"This place is the real deal for coneys.  Best in AZ and in a blind taste test I bet you'd have trouble telling which chili was \""made in Detroit\"" and which was made in Tempe.  Even better they do not short you on the chili.  They provide enough to where it overflows just a little bit with each bite.  Additionally, they also give an ample amount of chili on the chili fries so that you don't have all the ones on the bottom without chili.  \n\nMy only complaint, if you can even call it that, were the fries themselve were not exactly like you'd get at a coney in Detroit.  This is not to say they are not good...because they are very tasty...they are just different."

1,"I was so happy to see this place open in Buckeye, I was even happier when I called and got a sweet young lady on the phone that was pleased to inform me they have dairy free options available including sorbet and a german chocolate flavor that was actually pretty good! I can't really comment on the quality of the yogurt because being vegan my options are limited so I was only able to try the two but they were good to me, this will be a regular spot for me and my son so I hope in the future they will offer more dairy free options, I would love a vanilla or more sorbet options! They have a lot of toppings available including boba, which is my favorite. The atmosphere is great, very nice little spot, I hope they stick around!"
0,"I had bought a Groupon ($19 for the $45 signature pedi). When I called to make my appointment they couldnt get me in for nearly 3 weeks! This was my first experience going to Kashmir but definately not my first time getting a \""Spa Pedicure\"".  Upon arriving the outside was not much to getting excited about.  However once inside it was super cute! The staff was very friendly as well.  The reason I have to give this only 1 star really has to do with the services. I was seated  immediately on a couch in the back and was offered my free adult beverage.  As I waited I looked around and noticed there weren't any Spa Pedi Massage chairs.  I didn't piece it all together until my nail girl brought over a bucket of water and set it in front of me.  One of the main reasons I personally have pedi's done is for the massage and clean up of my piggies.  I didn't feel that I recieved what was worth $45. All the girls there were super sweet and the salon decor is just adorable. I'm sad I can't rave about my experience and services. Also, I prefer the bubbling spa massage chairs vs. sitting on the edge of a couch with a  bucket of water.  I don't have plans to go back as it was not worth my time & money."
1,"We were going to come here at noon on a Sunday, but we somehow got there at 2:30 instead.  Even at 2:30, there were a lot of people there, and we had to wait 45 minutes in line.  It turned out that this wasn't necessarily a bad thing.\n\nWhen we finally got to eat, we got the tail end of the brunch period, and they were switching the brunch food out for dinner food.  If you want to save money, come here at the end of lunch on a weekday, and eat the dinner stuff for relatively cheap.\n\nThere was a lot of expensivish food, like crab legs, bouillabaise, and various carved meats.  All of these were pretty good, although not really anything to write home about.  Unfortunately, I decided to fill up on the gnocchi, risotto, and onion soup (which were quite good) first, which didn't leave much room.\n\nThe desserts, including the crepe station, were awesome.  Probably my favorite part of the buffet.\n\nOverall, the buffet was quite good.  Although the food wasn't spectacular, I had a lot of it, and it was definitely worth the $25 or so that I spent.  Also, brunch on weekends includes champagne.\n\nUnfortunately, I don't really have any basis for comparison, as this is the only buffet I've been to in at least 3 years.  I'd probably also like to try the buffets at Wynn and Bellagio next time."
0,"The only reason why this rating gets 1 star is because there is NO option for NO stars. I should have just taken the drive down to Pho Saigon 8 on Spring Mtn. but my co-worker (who i'm going to strangle the next time i see him) told me that he goes here alot. Well he must like eating crap because thats what i had. The tiny bowl of non existent meat and vegetables tasted like sh**, not to mention that it also gave me the sh**s. I wont even get started on the service, which was worse then the food. So thats my yelp for this place. Take the drive to Pho Saigon 8. You won't be disappointed."
1,"Four words: seven-hour happy hour. I've only dined in a couple times, but taking advantage of their $5 specialty cocktails while waiting for takeout is well-worth showing up early!\n\nAlthough their extensive menu comprises mostly standard Asian-fusion fare, Ling & Louie's changes it up a bit with the addition of some \""American comfort food\"" options for its less adventurous patrons. \n\nAside from the spectacular drink specials and speedy take-away service, L & L's best culinary achievement is its tenderloin - particularly in the \""evil jungle princess\"" entree. If you like spicy food and high-quality meat, this dish is definitely a top pick.\n\nOverall I'd say this place is a 4/5, but I give it a 5/5 as far as Asian-fusion restaurants are concerned. The service is consistent and the food never disappoints - Thanks!"
1,"I must say, as buffets go, this one is good. Real good. We went for breakfast one Monday morning with some friends that were in town and we all left with full bellies and wallets still intact. Get this folks, a breakfast buffet that isn't just decent-- it's great--for the bargain price of $6.99 per person.  Of course, that's with your player's card, but if you're one of those weirdos that thinks the government is tracking your every move and don't want to give your personal information to those sneaky casinos, you're going to pay a whole dollar more. Yeah, that's $7.99. For a great buffet that includes made to order omelets, mini Belgium waffles complete with maple syrup or berries, all the crispy bacon you can inhale, bagels that you can load with inches of cream cheese or salmon and capers, delectable quiche, fresh fruit galore, pastries that would make the French proud and then some mediocre options like oatmeal and cold cereal.  Bonus: Amazingly, you won't smell smoke while eating OR leave smelling like smoke. Unless of course you spend your time digesting at one of those highly tempting coin-suckers. And even then you can sit in a non-smoking section for your gambling, asthma-attack-free, pleasure. Two words to sum up Red Rock's Feast Buffet for breakfast: LOVE IT!"
0,Dirty and dated.  Not my cup of tea. The entire building is in need of maintenance.  I'd find other accommodations.
1,"Hey, it IS a Target, you all should know what that is like.  \n\nWhat I like & appreciate about this store:\n- Usually very clean\n- Not crowded\n- Well Organized\n- I swear, the same clerk/customer service staff for the last 10 years\n\nWhat I don't like:\n- The height of the speed bumps in the parking lot\n- The lack of shade provided by the north side of the building when it gets past April.\n- I guess that is it.\n\nShort & sweet ;-)"
0,"The cold weather was killing my battery performance.  Like the car is sputtering and the battery does not have enough juice to turn the engine on.  I felt so helpless with the prospect of potentially being stranded somewhere or not being able to get to work.  So I ordered a replacement battery, and decided to head to Walmart and have their auto service department install the battery for $10 (that's what their website stated as one of the services offered).\n\nSo with a really deep saving on a premium battery I ordered online, I drove to Walmart Supercenter.  But the auto service department said they don't install batteries unless it was purchased from Walmart.  WTF?  Do I need to print out the Walmart webite and show you what services you do offer?\n\nAnyway, nothing was done, so I did the dirty work myself and saved the $10.\n\nNot a happy camper, but getting your hands dirty and doing something on your own is noticeably rewarding.  Not looking forward to it, but I know I can do it if I wanted to.\n\n2 stars!"
0,"What era is this?\n\nThat was my first thought as I stepped into this restaurant.  Mirrored ceilings, velvet upholstered chairs, cheetah print fabric -- it was like I was in the 80's or in the movie \""Scarface.\""  The place was pretty quiet and the atmosphere would be good for maybe a birthday or a graduation dinner. \n\nI came here with some clients for dinner (on a weeknight) while we were in Phoenix.  There were 2 or 3 other tables here that night; not very busy.   \n\nThe menu had a good selection of various Italian dishes: pastas, seafood, chicken, veal, pork, etc. \n\nFor starters, we all shared the Calamari (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/avanti-phoenix?select=ZZCRKeBcrFxbb4fZyaKsWw#KrxhHm5bvPqPTmXfpO2rjA) and the Escargot De Bourhohne (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/avanti-phoenix?select=ZZCRKeBcrFxbb4fZyaKsWw#_lPAyaWEzQ9QK92_i6trfA).  The Calamari was delicious!  The batter was light and crisp, and the squid was pretty tender.  The Escargot was cooked in garlic butter and brandy wine, which gave it some nice flavors.  It was a little chewy, but it pretty much tasted like a clam. \n\nWe all shared a bottle of the 2010 Markham Merlot (Napa Valley) -- this had a nutty, vanilla, woodsy flavor.  We all ordered seafood so it paired nicely with our dishes.  (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/avanti-phoenix?select=ZZCRKeBcrFxbb4fZyaKsWw#ofGN_r7-hk5EeZkx8W0h1g)\n\nFor my main dish, I went with one of the specials offered that night, the Squid Ink Ciopinno (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/avanti-phoenix?select=ZZCRKeBcrFxbb4fZyaKsWw#RCrj3Z_O7IyIUIVA6r5bTg).  This seemed more like a pasta rather than a ciopinno in my opinion.  What I love the most about ciopinno is that savory, rich, seafood broth.  This one didn't have any broth, it was more like a tomato sauce.  Although this dish did include a generous amount of seafood (mussels, shrimp, scallop), it didn't taste very fresh and had a rubbery texture. \n\nA few people at my table ordered the Dover Sole special that was available that night  (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/avanti-phoenix?select=ZZCRKeBcrFxbb4fZyaKsWw#9eQoEjUq1Ayiw6iKw4H5dg_.  This fish was fried whole, and then your server removes the fillet from the head/tail right before he served you.  Someone else ordered the Dover Sole dish that was available on the dinner menu (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/avanti-phoenix?select=ZZCRKeBcrFxbb4fZyaKsWw#RFHGeb_vykwNYJeIQv_fDA).  She did not seem to enjoy this very much.  I had a taste of it and it had a murky/mushy taste and texture to it.  The sauce was very buttery-- I prefer the fried Dover over this one.\n\nDessert was okayyy.  I ordered the Spumoni  (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/avanti-phoenix?select=ZZCRKeBcrFxbb4fZyaKsWw#RlDB83kUQaeOOU-6EItG8A).  It looks like a vanilla turd, lol.  The texture of the ice cream tasted like those ice cream cups you'd get in elementary school-- icee, not creamy, and dirzzled with some Hershey's chocolate syrup.. what a disappointment.  The sorbet was a lot better than the Spumoni and was a refreshing palate cleanser (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/avanti-phoenix?select=ZZCRKeBcrFxbb4fZyaKsWw#3go2OFhMl_zK2GETMSYJjg).  The Tiramisu (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/avanti-phoenix?select=ZZCRKeBcrFxbb4fZyaKsWw#pOWH0I8A7J4-UFByf4FR_A) was average.. not great and not bad. \n\nIn my opinion, the prices here are super steep, especially for most of the dishes we orderded.  Service-wise, we were welcomed upon entrance and our server was very attentive... but only in the beginning of the meal.  It took us forever to get our check."
0,"CLOSED. Where's a NO STAR rating when you need one. \n\nIt's too bad they got the boot. The food was great. Service blew, but the food was fantastic. I feel badly for all of the people who paid for wine \""memberships\"". In a time where every dollar counts, there's nothing quite like having it taken from you."
1,"Friendly staff, easy enough to find, and very good coffee. Definitely gonna be one of my new haunts."
0,"Okay we went in a group of eight at noon, so the place is packed with people and busy, we expected that. took us about 10 min to place order which was fine; rush hour. I Ordered white widow, blunt with guacamole sauce came to about 11$\nThe fun part started, waiting for our sub, after about 15 min first sub delivered to one of the guys in the group, another 5 min and everyone in the group got their sub but me so I decided to play it cool and be nice and give them some more time.\nAbout half a dozen of people got their subs and I still didn't get mine I asked for my sub and mentioned that I've been waiting for a while, the answer was oh what's your name oh ok yours is coming out in a second, a minute passed and didn't see my sandwich at this time i started getting upset asked again for my sandwich but no one seemed to have a clue about it and the person who seemed in charge looked for my order and said oh yea its coming, 5 min passed and another half a dozen of people went by and I still didn't get my sub. By now about 30 min have passed and more and more people got their food and I'm standing their watching. Went back to the staff and asked for my money back. \nI don't care how good the food looked like or how many people say its taste good, with this rudeness and carelessness this store is worthless. Btw One of the guys in my group got the wrong sandwich.\nI might give this store another try if they tried to make it up to me. Would I do it again with a group or a recommend to friend. No.  Don't embarrass yourself and go their.\n I'll let you know if they proven me wrong and contact me through Yulp and show that they do care.\nI will keep you guys posted"
1,People & service were great. The pastries were delicious. The coffee was too bitter for my taste otherwise I liked this place alot. I highly recommend it!
1,Monday night drink specials and an amazingly musical performance will be provided to you with a 5 dollar cover.. What more could you ask for?\n\n\nThis building breeds history and I was proud to experience it my last night in Charlotte.
0,"Food is good service has been consistently rude and dismissive. Ive eaten here several times. I will happily find other places to spend my money at that has a staff that will not lie and be rude. I've been in the food and beverage industry for 33 years, I always am saddened when I find a place that has good food but poor or substandard service."
1,"I originally stopped in for a meal and to watch the Wranglers' hockey game.  I brought along several of my children and their spouses (who love hockey).  Expecting standard fare bar food, I was more than pleasantly surprised.  \n\nOur meal began with several appetizers.  The roasted artichokes are beyond delicious!  My kids raved repeatedly about both the spicy green beans and the jalapeno strips.  They were delightfully flavorful with just a hint of spice.\n\nOur main courses included the bacon pizza, a philly steak sandwich, cajun penne and the spicy BBQ burger.I tasted all but the burger.  The food was creative, unique and interesting.  The onion rings were fried perfectly and the fries were crisp.\n\nIn the third period, they decided to have dessert.  Fried Oreos and Chocolate Brownie.  The Oreos were not impressive, but that is not my style of eating.  The brownie, however, was spot on!\n\nThe staff was pleasant, helpful, prompt and courteous.  Like I said, I came to nosh while watching a hockey game, but left telling everyone I know if they want a great little place to eat really quality food (and watch sporting events at the same time), Scooter is a MUST-DO!!!"
0,"These guys are crooks. They could not have been less organized when bringing our goods into the convention hall. It was as if they let 50 guys out of prison and give them forklifts. No joke. The guys who were supposed to unload our truck got into a violent argument over their favorite classic rock bands, so we ended up unloading the truck. \n\nWeeks later I find out that it cost me $1.00 per pound to move my exhibit the 200 ft from the loading dock to my space. I can ship goods from Boston to California for $0.30 per pound. \n\nThis rate is a total joke. The terrible service is just insult to injury. Companies like this just can't last. I won't be going back to Expo East and that's about $25k in lost revenue. That's someones job. There is recourse for being a crook and treating people like garbage."
1,"Overall very good food, and drinks. Reasonably priced, and the waitress that we had was awesome. The only hiccup was the hostess not providing us with a menu. First time going here, and will come back. Nice to know there are still nice sports bars, with decent prices on food and drinks around. Also the flat breads are great."
0,I ordered a couple of carne asada tacos and a large soda for $7.77. They have that soda dispenser that can deliver just about any soda known to man. They were out of the Diet Dr. Pepper so I was saying no bueno until I saw that they had Diet Barq's Rootbeer. Nice save!\n\nThe two carne asada tacos I had were basically two of the smallest tacos that I have ever seen. The taste was so so. They have a great outdoor patio and plenty of room in the dining area.\n\nBut I don't see myself coming back to America's Taco Shop.
1,"So my friends and I were in town for a conference, and we're trying to find a place that's better than fast food but wouldn't require reservations or dropping 40+/person.\n\nWe actually did the random restaurant picker @ Urban Spoon and got this place.  I was really impressed.  I had the Kobe Beef burger medium rare which was awesome as well as both sweet potato fries and onion rings.\n\nThe food was great, the service was fast (esp considering our waitress had a table of 15+ right next to us), and I'd definitely go back for 2nds."
0,"I really, really want to like The Diamond. It's cheap, convenient to my house, and my friends like it. Maybe I'm ordering the wrong things, but I'm just not even impressed enough to want to go without being decently drunk first. The first two times I went, I got breakfast food. Breakfast is kind of why I go to diners, I love it. Unfortunately, the Diamond can't manage cooking scrambled eggs. They came out rubbery and overdone both times. \n\nMy friends agreed that their breakfast is terrible and said I just had to try their lunch/dinner menu instead. Well, I gave it a shot with one of their signature sandwiches, a pork burger with onions, bacon, and cheddar. Three bone shards later, I decided I couldn't finish my pork burger and moved on to the sweet potato fries I had paid an upcharge to get. Mushy. My friend's regular fries tasted great, but they didn't get the sweet potato ones right. \n\nThe $20-for-2 dinner bill would have been a consolation if only the service had been quick enough to bring us our bill and the extra meal we had ordered. Unfortunately, just like some of our party's drinks and silverware, the server had forgotten and we had to wait another 15 minutes while they hustled it out of the kitchen. Meh."
1,Anyone going MUST try the fried zucchini it's AMAZING!! Great service and great food!! The servings are huge!! You can not beat the price. We will definitely be returning and recommending it to everyone.
0,Place is awesome. Food is also good. Service sucks and what ever you do look at your bill.   We went there with another couple . My good friends pick up the tab.  After paying we left that night they told us the bill was 345.00.  WTF.   We went over what we ordered cause we had a menu the bill with drinks came to 165.00.      Really 2 lady's 2 men. How much food can we eat.   We got a total of 5 dishes.   1 drink each.
0,"I really love thai food. So given that this place was so close to me and I'd never tried it, I really wanted to like it. The outside is shady to say the least. However when you walk in its ten times nicer. Staff was good. But overall the food just wasn't that great, especially for the price. I had two of the most commonly raved about dishes. The drunken noodles with soft shell crap and the crispy duck in curry. Both were less than awesome. I did have the tom kah which was pretty good. But overall the food just felt...greasy. And not all that tasty. Blah! I just feel like I've had so much better thai food in Los Angeles for half the price. I'd save your money, or order one of the lesser expensive dishes."
0,"I'd give this place a 0 if I could.  Over cooked.  Everything tasteless, unless you count the garlic which over powers anything.  \n\nThis used to be our fave Greek place.  Didn't like the changes in Nov and thought we'd give it another try. \n\nOn top of everything they wouldn't even honor their yelp coupon.\n\nWhat the hell."
1,"I found this salon online prior to coming to Vegas and my girlfriend and I decided to come here based on the reviews we had read. This was our first stop as soon as we arrived in Vegas. We LOVED this place. The salon was clean, staff was friendly and the services were phenomenal! Highly recommend this salon."
1,"This is one of my regular spots - good, everyday sushi at a decent price. Go during happy hour, 2 to 5 for their best deal. I go at least once a week to get my sushi fix. I like making my own roll selections though I have tried the menu items. It's very nice that they don't charge extra for brown rice. It's not gourmet sushi but it is good and if you want sushi as often as I do, this is a great place to get it."
1,"Fast and friendly, and can you say YUM?!!!  LOVE Chick-fil-A!"
1,"We have been looking for a car service to take us from Sky Harbor airport to our house in Peoria. We were so impressed with Black and White limo. From the first phone call to arrival at our door the service was 5 stars. Mike our driver was courteous and provided water upon arrival which was so appreciated. Unfortunately in Seattle many of the limo drivers are on their phones, weaving all over the roads and literally almost falling asleep that we don't feel safe. If only they could set up business in Seattle! Thanks again Chris and Mike for the amazing service."
1,"Located in the Shops at the Palazzo\n\nHands down the best gelato (or ice cream for that matter) that I have EVER had.  I don't care where I am staying on the strip I will make my way to this place to have sugar-free almond gelato.  While I am in line, I envy the crepe's that are being made and all of the coffee drinks.\n\nThis past weekend we went with some friends and I brought one of them here.  I bragged about it - and you know how when you brag about something then it has high expectations to meet and the person isn't impressed?  Well that DID NOT happen in this case, she was blown away!!!\n\nShe said, and I quote, \""Why did we have crepe's this morning, we could have come here.  Why did we eat dinner we could have just come here and got gelato\"".  And I agree.  That one small cup of gelato is so intense with flavor that I don't need to eat anything else!!!  And Sugar Free too?!  This is what heaven is made of (I hope!)\n\nOne cup of gelato runs about $6 out the door but it's so rich and flavorful that it's worth it."
1,"This was an enjoyable experience.  Tasted good and was priced decently.\n\nI had a bbq lamb sandwich.  Which is something I had never heard of.  It was essentially a pulled pork sandwich, but with lamb.  The sauce was good.  The bun was soft without being mushy.  The meat was tender.  The fries were really delicious; they had that sort of crumbly coating on them.  With the soda I think it was 7 or 8 bucks.\n\nEveryone else in the party had gyros which they all seemed to like.\n\nRestaurant was clean and the staff was friendly."
1,"Wonderful place.  It was serendipitous that we found it, it opened after I moved from the area to New Mexico.  When we were back in town a couple of weeks ago running around with our BFF, we asked my iPhone for book stores in the area and it popped up Bards.\n\nAll three of us were very happy, all three of us spent money, and we closed the place.  I found a great book that was a light treatment of philosophy, I only wish I had bought the Laurie Anderson coffee table book that he had, maybe it'll still be there when I am back in town next month.\n\nComfy chairs make it very pleasant to skim books to see what you like, and the owner was very friendly and helpful with comments and suggestions.  He also commented on what we bought, asking us to bring books in for credit based on our selections.\n\nOne thing it is not is a bargain book store.  It is tastefully furnished and well organized without the mildewy smell of some bargain stores.  You might not find $0.75 paperbacks here, but you will find interesting things.\n\nVery good store to which we'll definitely be returning."
1,"This is a favorite lunch break spot for my co-workers and I, because the menu is so diverse. You can get Greek, Italian, traditional American, and just plain 'ol breakfast foods all at the same place. How do I know this already? Strangely, they have another location on Reems and Greenway, while this \""Diner II\"" is a 5 minute drive away at Litchfield and Waddell! \n\nThe staff is so friendly here! It's like being greeted on the show Cheers whenever we come in. They know that I always order Greek chicken kabobs with a side order of the chicken lemon rice soup. If you are ever ill or someone you love is ill, get a bowl of their chicken lemon rice soup, and trust me, you'll feel better! It's seriously must be what the Chicken Soup for the Soul book must be based on (well, aside from the typical \""Aw\"" feel good stories).\n\nThe gyros are ginormous! I just wish that the feta cheese on the side wasn't extra, because gyros don't seem to be gyros without the cheese! \n\nMy friend, Kerry M., loves the fact that breakfast is served all day. She's had the biscuits and gravy dish and the hash browns which she said were delicious!\n\nI will continue to go to Nicks Diner I and II, because I enjoy their food, their company, and I love to support local restaurants. There are no bells and whistles, like swanky walls or posh decor (in fact, this location is super green... not kidding... walls, booths, tables...) This place is all about just comfort food for laid back people."
0,They got me in and out quickly for my appointment at the Genius Bar.  Unfortunately when I got home I realized the problem I came in for hadn't been solved.
1,"We had purchased tires here years ago, so when I ran into a \""split\"" tire (was not sure what was going on before I brough it in) on a run-flat tire, I kind of knew this would be the first stop to attempt to fix. \n\nI'm a girl and my husband was out of town, so I was handling this myself.  Despite it kind of being a long day there (because they were short staffed or something), these guys (especially Chris at the desk) could not have been nicer.  They educated me on what was going on, showed me exactly what the problem was, talked me through possible options to replace.  Very unintimidating, up front with expenses, honest.  I think Carlos was the service tech who worked on my car and he too was approachable, down to earth, educating and I liked that.  \n\nI would absolutely refer people to Tire Works Total Car Care on W. Sahara.  I felt like I was well taken care of and felt like they were good about making sure I understood what was going on.  THANKS CHRIS and CARLOS!"
1,These guys rock. Used them at the yard. They get you in and out quickly. Highly recommend these guys for valet. They are there with a smile. We even where out of cash and they did the job with with a smile and great enthusiasm - luckily we had cash in the car. But love the team. Great company .
1,"Dined here this past Friday night... We showed up a little past 8pm and were seated right away, and as if that weren't lucky enough we got a great table on their charming lil patio. I had high expectations for this place as the owners here are the same as my beloved Postino's. The food was great and did not disappoint. Their wine menu contained great options and the food menu contained alot of unique dishes, which I dig. I chose the mixed grain salad which was perfect, seasonally fresh items which all blended very nicely. The boyfriend had their burger and mac and cheese which I could tell he genuinely enjoyed, which is not easily accomplished. We passed on dessert this time, but I've had a Churn red-velvet ice cream sandwich before and it was uhhhmazing! We will definitely be returning here soon! (:"
0,"I've been going to cafe rio for a few years. Tonight I went and ordered a pork quesadilla with extra meat for a first time. I had ordered it to go and when I got home to open it I was very disappointed. They put meat inside, but seemed to have no cheese so the  tortillas didn't stick together and meat fell out everywhere. They never cut it into pieces so I had to use a knife and fork to cut the whole thing apart. It looked so unappetizing and looked like an open face taco, not a quesadilla. Very disappointed they would serve this."
0,"The place was wonderful, don't get me wrong. However, they should improve their cleaning. After staying at this hotel, my friend got huge rashes all over her body and after speaking to the manager, they didn't even show any sympathy. No apology whatsoever. Ultimately, one of the staff came to our room to make an incident report and they never came back with the results which means they didn't do anything about it. Yeah, definitely not coming back here."
0,"While out and about for my friends bday, we stopped in this place for dinner. \n\nI had the enormous nachos which was great! Others had burritos, quesdillas, etc. The food was pretty good, always pricey on the strip. The reason why I gave this place a 2 star was the service! \n\nHorrible customer service. Not to be mean but the server was trashy. Why does one need her breast in my face while I'm eating mexican food. I did not know we were at a strip club. I don't think she even smiled once. We waited forever for our check and although my friends stated clearly they did not want their quesdilla they order previously, she still brought it was made a big fuss. \n\nOh well-"
0,"Not exactly sure how I can put this: It is a musical in the minuscule secondary room upstairs located at V Theatre that has a simple enough template storyline but is just confusingly bad. Could be cute if it were a jr. high school production putting it on for 5$ or something, but really is not worth whatever they will charge for it here. \n\nYou will recognise the majority of the songs, and I suppose if you are really fucked up it could be highly entertaining. If you are sober, you probably will not find it that amusing. Some of the actors do indeed try (namely 'Turtle' and the goth character); in fact, in a different production with a different play (maybe somewhere other than the V theatre, that seems to be plagued with seriously bad series of shows). - E\n\nPostscript. I found the rail thin principle female character to be good as well; unfortunate that the play script is awful."
1,"Smart & Final is a bit of an odd one. It's part normal grocery store, part bulk club store, and part restaurant supply store. \n\nNow I'm not a huge fan of Costco or similar club stores... the prospect of having to pay a fee to shop somewhere annoys me on principle. Plus, every time I go I realize they simply don't carry what I like. \""Oooh, great price on toothpaste - if I want to get a different kind than I normally get,\"" or \""Oooh sweet, they have a great price on soap... just not the scent I like.\"" I don't know - I can either load up a cart with shit I don't actually want because it's cheap or I can pay more to get exactly what I want. \n\nSmart & Final does have bulk items, but the prices are only marginally better than grocery store on most stuff. They do have some great deals, but don't expect to come here to save money. What they do offer is great quality stuff... in mass quantities. They carry \""restaurant-quality\"" foods. I love the coffee they sell and some of their ready-to-cook stuff is fantastic (like Shrimp Scampi or raviolis)... plus, it's a great place to pick up household supplies. \n\nIf you're like me and you don't like to go shopping more than once a month and you also can't stand the idea of paying a membership fee to shop somewhere, this place is great. If you run a little restaurant or shop, this place is perfect. Also great for if you are planning on catering your own party. Snacks, pasta, fruit, bread, pie, gum, coffee, detergent, tp, serving trays, etc... \n\nAbout that - if you are having a bunch of people over for a dinner party or a reception or something but you don't want to hire caterers, you can buy everything you need here for any style or taste. \n\nThe wine selection isn't that good, the prices aren't going to blow your mind, you do sign up for a card (though they don't spam you with junk mail), and they do lack in a few areas, but this place is worth checking out sometime and definitely worth checking out if you are hosting a party.\n\nThis place is a 3 and a half for me, but I'm going to go ahead and give it a 4 since we can't do half points."
1,"Finishing up a major renovation just in time to host the 6th Annual Bartenders Ball, the Blake is an exercise in visually appealing modern design with plenty of details to entice the eye.  A very sexy lobby lounge furnished in black, white and glass greets you as you enter and check in.  Up in the rooms one is greeted by an almost tiki ambience.  And the bar that just reopened on the ground floor has bold avant garde furnishings and friendly staff.  \n\nThey are still tweaking out a few details such as phones that don't work, electrical socket fixtures that don't match the rest of the decor and missing towel bars.  But when they're done with renovations recommended by a NY design firm, it will be a force of coolness to be reckoned with."

They stayed on the West side and we decided to go to Chef Ben's because a friend's daughter works there and it is her first job.  Us Aunts wanted to say hello and give her a hard time.  he he he!  \n\nIt was cute & clean place.  They have a mix of Japanese and Chinese food.  I ordered the double chicken (panko & grilled) with teriyaki!  The teriyaki was sweeter than I like but it was good.  The service staff was good.  The prices are reasonable.  I would come back to visit again!"

0,"Ok. So I was so pumped about this place that I went a second time and took my family that was visiting from hawai!! Sure, the wait was 2hours long, but I told them it was going to be WORTH IT. Yes, $37.00 was pushing it..... which was what we paid the last time we came, but I told them they'd get their moneys worth. \n\nWe finally get to the front where we pay for out entrance, and the lady said it was \""$44\""  automatically im thinking, HOLY CRAP WE WERE JUST HERE and the price was not 44. She said the price changed a few days ago. Well, they should have put up a sign or something, how was I to know that?! the 37.00 was still plastered all over the website! I figured FINE, we already waited 2 hours, we might as well.  I asked for a party of 8, and she said they couldnt do more than 4 per table!! I was in shock! I mean i knew that they were busy, but one of the tings I loved about this buffet when I was there the last time was the big huge round tables they had to accommodate large groups! Right then and there I asked to speak with a supervisor, and even she was rude.  She said, and i quote , \""Maam, you can clearly see were busy, we cant take big parties on one table.\"" I told her Id be willing to wait, and she told me it was going to be \""Another 2 hours\"" I was upset, so I just took it and said fine, give us 2 separate tables.\n\nSo we get to our table, and get this. they sit us near 4 EMPTY huge tables that seat a part of 8!!!!! I was LIVID. i went up to the front and told them about it and they said that they didnt have a server for the section, even though it was 2 feet away from us! \n\nOh, and it gets worse.... so we've already waited 2 hours in line right? Just the line alone to get to the food was ridiculous!!! I waited for 15 in just for crab legs..... when I went to the asian section to get the roasted duck that I wanted, it was COMPLETELY empty, and had to wait for that too.... and a lot of the stuff they used to have when I first went there was GONE.\n\nOverall, $44 for a buffet? Bad Service? Not enough food? Long waits? SOOOOO OVERRATED! I wont ever go back, I can get way better food for $44 and wayyy better service and not have to wait as long.  Wicked spoon at the  Cosmo is now my new Number 1!!!"
0,"Wow. It could have been great.  It could have been incredibly sexy.  It could have been a show to remember.  Instead, it was a painful flop.\n\nFirst, the good.  The girls were all quite beautiful, as you would expect from a show like this.\n\nNow, everything else.\n\nThe chairs all faced the stripper pole in the middle of the room instead of the stage where most of the action took place.  They were hard, wooden chairs which were quite painful to sit in. Since they didn't face the stage, you spent the evening with your head turned to the side to see the stage.\n\nThe performances, if you can call them that, were lack-luster at best.  The show was horribly choreographed, and the girls were seldom, if ever in synch with each other.  Sure, they went through the motions, but it was obvious that most of the girls didn't care to be there, and their poor attitudes really came through in their (lack of) performances.\n\nThis was NOT a burlesque show.  It was instead a really bad strip show, loosely strung together with the same dancers doing typical stripper routines over and over.  For the same money, you can get a better strip show at a real strip club here in Vegas, including transportation and drinks!\n\nLip synching songs on a stage production?  Really?  How about some effort and actually performing the songs?  The girl-girl scenes were all contrived, and there was no sense that any of the performers were actually 'in to' their performances.\n\nThe comedienne in the middle of the show was awful. Her jokes were tired and her delivery was way off mark.  She came across as insulting and un-funny, and couldn't even keep her own life story, which she attempted to weave into her act, straight. Her only purpose was seemingly to make an already bad and uncomfortable show even worse. \n\nBottom line: skip this horribly produced, barely choreographed, strip show where the girls aren't tipped so they have no reason to care.  Hell, Donnie and Marie would be a better show than this crap was.  We should have walked out like the other dozen or so people who actually had some sense."
0,I was so excited to try this place out at the Estrella mountain event on July 3rd. Unfortunately I was extremely disappointed especially after paying $8 with tax! I had the goat cheese melt the bread tasted old. I love goat cheese but whatever was in the sandwich was just bland. After my first bite the half I was eating completely fell apart.
0,"Mediocre at best.  This place is a wonderful example of American cuisine gone wrong.  When a restaurant relies on salt and mayonnaise as the staple flavor profile, the food is well, boring (i.e. Chipotle Mayo).\n\nRed Robin is a burgers and fries type place, fried everything.  Fried everything should be DELICIOUS!  What is missing?\n\nThe presentation of all the dishes is fine, it is the utter lack of flavor that was so disappointing.  Had a burger and onion rings, and while there was nothing particularly wrong with it, it was completely forgettable.\n\nThe atmosphere is very corporate.\n\nThe service is designed to be good, but falls flat, again too corporate (waiter virtually up your ass when you don't need him, and not around when you do).\n\nIn summary, there are way better places to spend your time, money and calories.  We gave it a shot, and it wasn't our cup of tea.  If you like it, more power to you.  \n\nI usually do not review restaurants until I have given them several chances and tried different items, but I won't be returning.  I just can't bring myself to eat here.  The food is edible, but while I was eating, I actually wondered to myself why I was eating it."
1,"This is good tasting yogurt, no doubt, but it also is pretty minimal compared to its rivals.  I guess you could make the quality over quantity argument,  but I like having a lot of options.  In addition to yogurt, they also sell baked goods (cupcakes, carrot cakes, brownies).  While the baked goods looked divine, I would have preferred an expanded toppings bar.  \n\nHomemade cupcake on the side of my ice cream?  Nah.\nHomemade cupcake INSIDE my ice cream?  Now that is the kind of thing that you dream about and wake up next to a pile of drool.\n\nMy first time experiencing self-serve froyo was many years ago, in San Diego, while pregnant. I remember practically lifting my jaw off the ground because I could not believe the wonderfulness of so many flavors and so many toppings all just at the tip of my fingers.  And all though the yogurt was very tasty, I didn't get that thrill from just six flavors (including chocolate, plain and strawberry).  The cakebatter sounds delightful, but they didn't have that today - graham cracker was as exciting as it came.\n\nSame with the toppings - there were not even any sprinkles!  And, don't get me wrong, I love crushed chocolate bars and fresh strawberries as much as the next person, but I did miss having an array of colors and an almost overwhelming topping selection.  I do need to tip my hat though to the \""boba balls,\"" which were basically little balls of fruit that burst in your mouth as you ate them.  \n\nAs covered by everyone else, the store was thoughtfully clean. Fresh water was also offered.  And, if you are like me and get a huge ice cream to share with two little kids, the three different colored spoons (pink, blue and  yellow) available at the register are a fun little perk.  You are probably not like me though --- however, a pink spoon is always worth a mention."
0,"This place is horrible. I will never stay here again. The customer service is soooooo bad. I flew in from California and they gave my reservation away saying \""reservations are not guaranteed.\"" Elevators hardly work. They deactivated my room key everyday. Housekeeping knocks on your door everyday at 9am to remind them of checkout even if they are not checking out. Security got caught on camera taking a football game break IN my hotel room, not realizing someone had checked into it.The decor is very nice, but thats the only nice thing about this place. Their credit card swipes are so janky that it never works properly. Worst hotel experience Ive ever had."
0,I have spent nearly a total of 7 nights and over 5 hrs with different people trying to resolve connectivity issues. Every different person suggests something else to be done including upgrading speed and purchasing diff modems. The service breaks up and is intermittent. Too bad they are the better of the rest of the providers.
0,"I like going to Red Robin; however, I do not particularly like the one located at the Tempe Marketplace.  My boyfriend and I decided to eat dinner there last Sunday night.  We were pretty hungry and we thought that Red Robin would hit the spot.  I was looking forward to the Salmon Burger.  \n\nWe were seated immediately in a booth.  We looked through the menu and decided what we wanted to eat.  After five minutes, no one came to greet us.  Waitresses kept walking by, but no one stopped to say hi or get our drink order.  We waited five more minutes, by that time we were looking around to see if we had a waitress.  Still no one...we decided to leave and go to In-N-Out Burger.  I was really looking forward to a Salmon Burger, but I don't like bad service much less no service.  The location was not busy at all and there was no reason from my end why someone couldn't come up to us and let us know what was going on.  Those other waitresses passed by us and even looked right at us.  They knew we weren't getting served.  They could have possibly kept me there if they acknowledged that we were there and would locate our waiter/waitress.  I know this is one incident, but it really puts a bad taste in my mouth."
1,"Love the food here and huge selection of beers.  Its hard to find a bar/restaurant with good food but u will definitely find both at BJs. I recommend their flatbreads, burgers,  and for an appetizer I would go with bruchetta... so good!"
0,"Horrible HORRIBLE SERVICE!!!! Zero stars across the board for service. How can such a place stay in business this long with such aweful service?? Don't get me wrong the restaurant downstairs was amazing the best tacos i've ever had and the wait staff was great but the hotel staff themselves were beyond rude. It started at Check-in when the very unprofessional concierge was explaining certain rules and stating how \""stupid\"" guests are by thinking if they open something or break something the hotel wont track them down and charge them double. The WORST WORSTTTTT part was one exhausting evening we arrived back from a friend's wedding to find our room wasn't cleaned and there was this gross disgusting smelly dirty rag on our coffee table till this day \""no one\"" knows how it got there. I called the front desk to complain and I was treated like a god aweful criminal that apparently travels around with dirty rags in my bag and leaves them in hotel rooms. The concierge I believe his name was Denny, made it seem like it was all of our fault and that the hotel could do no wrong. On top of what I would call..hmm whats the complete OPPOSITE of great service?? He offered to clean our room himself which in it's self was extremely creepy. He became very defensive and made me feel extremely uncomfortable. I packed my bags and left. We stay at the PALOMAR btw and that my friends is what I call great service."
1,"I've never really enjoyed buffets, but my wife wanted to come here for her birthday. I never really felt like I could get a good meal at a buffet but I was wrong. \n\nThe sushi was really good. They had at least 10 different rolls and not just the basic rolls but stuff like Rainbow rolls and the likes. Tried them all and they were all very good. They had one sushi chief just throwing out rolls cause the sushi was going fast. They also had tempura which included lots of vegetables plus shrimp. \n\nThey had a meat bar with prime rib, Chinese BBQ ribs, & sausage. The ribs are really good. Nice and sweet. You have to try these ribs.The sausage is ok and didn't try the prime rib but looked good. Lots of good Chinese food with lots of seafood in it and I enjoyed it. There was also a cold bar with salads and fresh fruit. Lastly, they have a pretty good desert bar where they have a server scoop out the ice cream. \n\nSo overall, they have lots of selections of different kinds of food but most important it's all fresh. You could tell that none of the dishes have been sitting out there for a long time. Very fresh and hot. \n\nService was good. Picking up our dirty dishes and filling up our water glasses in a timely manner. All I can say is that the food is really good, lots of variety to satisfy everybody, but the best part is that if you Check-in you get a 20% off your bill. \n\nEnjoy and have a really good meal."
0,"I usually order from another place but they don't deliever to my work place. I gave Chop Wok a try after a suggestion from a fellow employee.  I ordered 2 Shrimp Dishes.  Both I felt were disappointing and for what I payed I was expecting more.\nI got mostly a box full of veggies smothered in gravy  with 4 shrimp,  and a carton of overcooked noodles 3 shrimp and about 50 watercrests. ( not that I dont like them it's just it was almost all there was in the box with the noodles. )\n\nI think from now on Ill stick to my local place instead and bring their food with me to work."
0,"The food here is top notch, don't know where to find better chicken and waffles. I keep coming back, but there's something wrong when I have bad service over half the time.\n\nI don't know what the deal is, but on more than one occasion we've had unpleasant waiters/waitresses. I don't ask for much at restaurants, but reflling water or asking for a couple more minutes to look at the menu should not warrant a skank face. Maybe the serving staff had a bad day... multiple times... during the same week...\n\nEh, who knows. I guess that makes it a \""legitimate\"" Southern experience, but regions don't excuse poor service. I suggest going for the classic combo, but don't be surprised if things go south from there..."
1,always have a great time here.
0,"To sum up our dining adventure, my husband's comment as we left was \""Well, that was a totally forgettable experience\"".    I had a glass of wine, and wanted another glass to go with the actual meal........the waitress never returned.   Even though I had an empty wine  and water glass and my husband's ice tea was empty.   Overall, the food was fine, but at the prices charged, one should not have to be looking around, hoping to spot their waitress in order to get a beverage refill.    \n\nI ordered the bleu cheese filet and it was delicious.   My husband ordered the Delmonico steak, cooked medium well.   It was definitely done WELL, no pink in sight.   He ate it anyway, since no one checked on how it was and he was hungry.\n\nWould go elsewhere next time."
0,"03/23/13 DINNER\n\nI was tempted to give this place only 1 star, but since the owner/server was a nice guy, I went with 2 stars.\n\nOn 02/27/12 spouse and I had dinner here. We brought a GROUPON along, and as it turned out, it was worth the long drive and price for what we had. Spouse really liked the chicken fried chicken.\n\nSo a few months ago a repeat of the GROUPON was offered. I got one.\n\nWell, we were extremely disappointed this time. It had a few ups, but mostly downs.\n\nWe came this night for their announced Saturday night special, which I will copy verbatim from their Facebook page: IT'S SATURDAY MARCH 23rd AND....TODAY'S SPECIAL IS....ROASTED TURKEY BREAST WITH DARRELL'S HOMEMADE CORNBREAD STUFFING (THIS IS DELISH!!) SERVED WITH FRESH MASHED POTATOES AND GRAVY(made from the drippings mm mm good) VEGETABLE, DINNER ROLL AND CHOICE OF HOMEMADE SOUP OR CRISP GREEN SALAD!!!\n\nWe arrived. I saw a sign at the front door announcing \""Saturday & Sunday only, check in with Facebook and get unlimited mimosas for $10 or half priced bloody marys\"". I said to myself, Why Not?, and proceeded to check in. I showed my phone to the owner/server (Darrell?), and he said \""Oh, that's only offered at brunch, and as I don't own the bar, I can't make that offer for dinner.\"" It's a tavern with him (Darrell?) subleasing the restaurant side of the building. That's fair enough. (It's similar to what Carluccio's did, moving from the Liberace center to a Henderson tavern.) But he (Darrell?) proceeded to bring us a free basket of fried mozzarella sticks, which was very nice of him (Darrell?), and were actually pretty good.\n\nWe got the bloody marys after all, and it was one of the worst I've ever had. Why? For one, my olive was previously attacked by a bug (no lie, a chunk bit out of it, obviously insect-eaten) and the cocktail tasted metallic. I probably should've returned it, but then there were those free moz sticks, sitting there...\n\nAfter ordering said Saturday night special, next up were cup of soup or salad. I got the homemade chili, which was good. Spouse got the salad, and was quite happy. It even had dandelion greens. In the 2.25 years of living here in Vegas I don't think we've seen those in a salad. (Was it a packaged salad? If it was, it was surprising.)\n\nBut then the main course comes. It was not turkey BREAST, it was turkey LOAF. Lots of white and grey-dark meat, sliced from a loaf, perfectly circular, falling to pieces. It was OK, but it wasn't anything special, or worth the price charged. And the \""veg\"", the green beans, we forgot about this part from the last visit, they were sadly canned. Remaining was some cranberry sauce (OK, likely canned, no problem), the potatoes (a small scoop of homemade, these were good), the dressing (also seemed homemade, good) and the gravy (which I think wasn't from \""drippings\"" because the last time I cooked a turkey loaf I don't recall all that many drippings, so we think it was bottled/packaged). The dinner roll was a version of texas toast, no garlic, just a grilled roll.\n\nDidn't order the homemade, just out of the oven, peach cobbler, offered by the owner/server (Darrell?). We promptly left after dinner. A lot of the turkey loaf came home for the kitties.\n\nIf I hear they've improved, we might again make the trip out there. But I doubt that will happen.\n\nPS One other problem. We arrived to find a couple of uncontrolled kids running around the VERY SMALL restaurant, at times screaming. It continued throughout most of our visit. I guess the word \""Families\"" in the name of the place should've been a clue of the possibility of an undesired child \""carnival\"", supplied by their uncaring-of-other-patrons parents. (At the same age as those kids, if I had behaved that way in a restaurant with my Navy Commander father at the table, I would've been beaten to a pulp. Times have certainly changed.)"
1,My wife and I come here often as the food is always good and the service is usually pretty stellar too. They have daily lunch and dinner specials where you get to choose two sides with it. You get a ton of food and the price is reasonable for just about everything. They also have a good breakfast selection. This is pretty much a diner style type place so if you enjoy food at places like that then you will love it here. It can be crowded on weekends and sometimes there is a wait. Definitely recommend this place all around.
1,While browsing through barber shop photo hashtags in Las Vegas I came across @sam_scissorhands_silva and couldn't help but notice the clean cuts and detail he puts into his cuts. I wanted to get my son a cool cut with a little Poly flair since I am also a Tattoo artist and love my culture. Figured it would be fitting for my boy to wear a little tribal in his hair. Set an appt with Sam and came in the next day. He was very chill and I could tell my son lost all his anxiety after talking to Sam. I told Sam what I wanted for my sons hair and he executed it perfectly. He is now my boys barber. Loved the vibe of the place and everyone their was super friendly and chill. I am also thinking of checking out the dance studio for hip hop lessons for him as well.
1,"You get 5 stars because every time I put $100 on black, it was black at Planet Hollywood Casino, there was even one point I did it 4 times in a row at 4 different tables just to see if I was actually \""lucky\""\n\nIt also doesn't hurt that I love Planet Hollywood in general and that this place is awesome!  It's probably my favorite Casino in Vegas, however, it's not my favorite hotel... \n\nLove this place."
1,Great buffalo wings and pizza. Also seen some great subs come out on true Italian hoggie rolls. If your from Buffalo come and support a new local business.
0,It was a fast smog check..... But on the banner it says accepts all coupons. I brought a 9.99 coupon from purrfect auto. The guy there says he does not take the 9.99 coupons but will do it for 15!! Wtf! Last time I checked that was an any coupon!!!!!!
0,"The drive through barista has been a bit surley when I have visited there.  Today the credit card receipt blew out their window and the barista only said \""lovely\"" and stomped away as if it was my fault?  They seemed a little rude."
1,"DAM, we can't wait to eat at the Beaver again! it's true! it's true!\n\nBut before I tell you how great it was a few things need to be mentioned. I was teetering between 4-5 stars on this one because of the European Style Service and I had to forgive them for using canned green beans in the green bean salad. However because of the really over the top seasoning of the prepared foods we tried and the UNIQUENESS of this Quirky one of a Kind place it deserves five stars. You also need to know that this is a Tiny Mom and Pop shop in a strip mall that is BYOB SCANDINAVIAN Bistro that makes your meals fresh to order and when we were the only order it took at least half and hour to prepare. This is not a fancy place and they provide some games like Yahtzee to play with while you wait.\n\nWe ordered the Chicken Schnitzel and the Gravlax platter,the platters come with THREE SIDE SALADS EACH and A SIDE DISH!\n\nI had the Gravlax and it was sliced very thin was very fresh and very flavorful I think anyone who eats Lox would like the Gravlox here. For my side salads I picked the house made cole slaw,it was very light and fresh no creamy heavy sauce(it was very good) , tomato basil salad, it was very fresh with lots of fresh basil and yummy balsamic , Peas (just plain) and for my side dish I picked the rosti potato. THAT POTATO was DELICIOUS but was SO LARGE it could feed a small country I could only eat about 1/4 of it.\n\nMy husband had the regular chicken schnitzel it was pounded thin , breaded just right and came with a side of mushroom sauce,It tasted very good. One of the sides he picked was the green bean salad and I noticed they are canned green beans, that really is my only slight complaint on any food here.\n\nThey don't sell any desserts that are day old here only fresh made and they have the good humor to sell a dessert called Beaver Balls."
1,"Great place to go for lunch or dinner on any day of the week.  Had a chance to go here for lunch today and had a wonderful experience.\n__________________________________________________________\nHighlights:\n*CLEAN - the restaurant looked immaculate.  Even though we were one of the day's first patrons, the place was clean, and I'll take that whenever I can get it\n* GREAT SERVICE - Waitress was friendly and polite.  Even though our waitress was training another waitress, it didn't interfere with the service or our overall dining experience.\n*PERFECT TIMING - any great dining experience has great service and great PACE with that service; quick, but not rushed.  We were able to get in and out within 45min, which was just what my gf and I were looking for.\n*PRICE - For such a nice, upscale feeling place, the prices are very reasonable.  We were able to get in and out for UNDER $30, and that included a Mimosa.  \nPARKING -  COMPLIMENTARY VALET\nFOOD - Both of our dishes (see pics) were very tasty and filling.  Everything tasted freshly made, and was made to our mutual liking.\n\nLow-lights:\n*Nothing comes to mind.\n\nI am a fan of this place, and would jump at the chance to dine here again."
0,"My friend and I showed up for Easter brunch only to be turned away.  They just said we have no openings, did not say when next available time would be.  Disgusting regard for customers,  I've never felt so insulted."
1,"This review is for Tierney. \n(I hope that's right. It's what my receipt says.)\nI don't usually single out servers, but she was so incredible (as was the awesome hostess on Monday night) that I feel like I need to mention her by name. \n\nOur group of yelpy trivia players this past Monday grew from 4 to 5 to 7 to 9 to 12 over the course of an hour or so, and each time we needed to add more seats and swap people about, she knew exactly where people were and what they ordered. With each arrival she brought a menu, ran through the food specials time and time again (poor thing... it's fries and wings y'all... half off... every Monday... now you know) and made sure that pints were full of Yelp's Bursting Red Ale and that we felt tended to. \n\nTipsy Trivia is one of my favorites in town, simply because almost everyone who's there on Monday plays. I have to imagine the servers aren't as excited about it as I am. Cheap fries, cheap wings, growing party sizes... it's probably a server nightmare. But ours was a breath of fresh air and for pub grub and beer, it was probably some of the best service I've received in Madison. \n\nAs for the food, it's what you'd expect. I've always felt the burgers are a little over cooked, but you can stack 'em high, so that's a plus. Parmesan wings were a touch overwhelming, but the standard and the Asian glazed made mouths happy. And rotating taps keep things interesting, and it was exciting to see some \""locals\"" (midwest but not Madison) that I had never heard of."
1,"I had read about this locally-owned business in the Ahwatukee-Foothills News and then noticed a coupon in the mail.  We were having a party in a few weeks and the carpets were a mess, not to mention the three areas that had been snagged/ripped from when our Puggle was a puppy.  It was perfect timing to give a new company a try.\n\nI called and scheduled an appointment for carpet cleaning and repair for the three spots.  The woman on the phone was kind and helpful.  She answered all of my questions and scheduled my appointment.\n\nWhen the man arrived to clean the carpets, he was very friendly, knowledgeable, and easy-going. He even went into my attic to get the extra carpet for the repairs!  He worked quickly and even put up plastic guards to protect the corners of the furniture and walls so that the hose didn't leave any marks from being dragged through the house.  And he had little booties on his feet (OK, more like big booties) so that his shoes didn't get the floors dirty.\n\nTwo things to be aware of.  1 - This time, my carpets did take a little longer to try because I didn't go with the company that has the fast-drying chemicals.  This is the organic stuff, no short cuts here, but a much better feeling than having chemicals under your feet!  2 - No credit cards accepted.  Check or cash.  No biggie, as long as you have your checkbook on had.\n\nOverall, I was very impressed with the quality of service and quality of work that I received from Barefoot Organic.  Plus, all for a very reasonable price!  I will be sure to use them again and highly recommend them for your carpet cleaning or repair needs."
1,"I LOVE THIS PLACE! First off, it's like walking into a book when you walk through the door. It's so cozy and homey...... sigh. I wish I could be there now.\n\nThey have great coffee, tea, meals, and little snack/desert bars. TRY THE MAGIC BAR!!! SO GOOD!!!\n\nThere yoga classes are also great! \n\nIf you ever get the chance, go!"
0,"Since we stayed at Encore, we decided to have lunch here to get the whole \""Encore experience\"".  Boy, did we choose the wrong place.\n\nStrike One:  They have a thing called \""stop-seating\"", where they take a couple of parties, seat them, stop the line from moving for 30 minutes, then repeat.  Why they do this when they have a bunch of empty tables available for seating?  I have no clue.\n\nStrike Two:  Menu is -VERY- limited and when we finally ordered, it took about 30 minutes for my family's breakfast plates to arrive, AND  we were not served any bread baskets, when other tables clearly had.  But I mean, breakfast?  How long does it take to make some scrambled eggs and toast?  Definitely not 30-40 minutes.  The toast were also burnt real badly, but we didn't ask them to replace them since we didn't want to take the chance of waiting even longer.  My side order of onion rings came out before my main dish, which I found to be weird and they were more soggy than crispy, pretty bland tasting as well.  My dish, which was a Ham & Cheese sandwich didn't come out until about another 20 minutes.  Um, it's a ham & cheese sandwich, again I don't comprehend why it took so long.  \n\nStrike Three:  The food was mediocre, but the last straw was when we waited 15-20 minutes for our bill/receipt.  We were at the cafe for about 2 hours, 90 minutes of that approximately was waiting time (including waiting to be seat).  Ridiculous, since the food was mediocre and pretty pricey.  I'm never eating here again.\n\n=============================\n\nOn a side note:  The guy below me (Matthew P.) is a completely jackass and was completely rude when I sent him a message giving him a heads up on what I thought was a repeated review of Society Cafe.  Instead of simply telling me I was wrong, this is what he said:\n\n\""Um, check your date Dearie. I wrote my review on the 28th, you wrote yours on the 29th.  You are the one who repeated an entry. Check yourself before criticizing others.  Sorry you're so hard to please. I had a great time at Society.  Tell Mommy and Daddy to take you somewhere else.  I feel sorry for you.  EOM.\""\n\nThen blocked me.  How very mature of you, Matthew."
0,Grilled Cheese had two hairs stuck in the cheese with no avocado (when I asked for some) and bacon (when I asked for none) as well as cold fries. The waitresses would only stop by my table every 20 minutes so I couldn't even tell her it was messed up. Got our check and there was an extra $11 charge for wings we never ordered and the waitress AGAIN was nowhere to be found so we couldn't let her know. We had to track down a random busser to get someone to fix the problem. Wings finally taken off the check and waitress AGAIN was nowhere to be found for another 30 minutes. She didn't even seem like she wanted us to pay her. It was like she wanted us to leave without paying so she would be stiffed. We finally gave our check to the manager so we could pay and leave. Two hours longer than we wanted to be there. ITS CALLED A SENSE OF URGENCY PEOPLE.
0,"The people who run (own?) this restaurant are sweet and kind.  Do not try the spaghetti.  I don't think they are experienced at eating it...let alone preparing it.  One receives about 1/3 the necessary sauce.  The meatballs?  They may have been small \""balls\"" at one time, but they are cut into hard pieces of unidentifiable meat.  The location is great and a well-established local pizza store was there for decades.  I wish a restaurant expert would befriend these owners and give them a few tips on service and some new recipes.  I'm sad for them."

0,"This place is a  disaster.  I decided to try it when I drove by.  I only wanted to-go food.  The hostess/to-go server hadn't tried anything so couldn't make suggestions. I ordered two entrees and two kids meals.  She also didn't know what kind of sauces came with the chicken fingers.  After waiting 22 minutes for the food at the bar, where the bartender never greeted me, she dropped off the to-go bag at my table, said thanks and walked away.  I realized on the way home that I was missing several items, including a full entree I'd paid for.  When I called, and said who I was, she said, \""yeah, you forgot your kids drinks.\""  Wait, I forgot them?  Me?  Did I forget to put them in the bag?  Gee, I guess I left those kids' drinks with the entree I forgot to bring, but which I'd paid for.  Man, what an awful experience.  Won't be back."
0,Can't believe that anyone who's ever had quality sushi would like this place. This place would be out of business back in Cali. Not only is the sushi boring but it's WAY OVER PRICED!
0,Well below average especially for the price. Maybe I'm spoiled in San Diego but this place was mediocre at best.
0,"Coming from a Filipino, I wasn't all that impressed.\n\nI usually head to the ASU Food Truck Block Party on Wednesdays to grab lunch with a couple coworkers. I had seen Hey Joe! there the past few times we had gone, but having grown up eating Filipino food with my dad's family, I was skeptical and gravitated to the other trucks. Since the Block Party has had more or less the same selection the past few weeks, I decided that this week I would finally give Hey Joe! a chance.\n\nI imagine that for many of their customers, Filipino food is a new thing. The food wasn't god awful, so I can see why many the untrained taste bud might be raving about this. \""Filipino food! Sounds different!\""\n\nI ordered the chicken adobo with rice, and a side of two lumpiang shanghai. Probably the most Filipino thing about my food was the fact that the \""to-go\"" container consisted of two Dixie paper bowls covered in foil. The chicken adobo lacked that certain quintessential flavor that makes Filipinos everywhere crave it so much. The lumpia, or egg rolls as I wouldn't even call these real lumpia, had no pork, unlike most lumpiang shanghai, and the veggies inside left a bland taste. I did not receive any of the typical sweet chili sauce that you're supposed to eat lumpia with. I did receive a side of atchara, or pickled radish, with my lumpia, so at least they made an effort there.\n\nIf you really want to try Filipino food, I recommend going to one of the many restaurants we have in the Phoenix area."
0,standard sports bar. met a friend here for lunch. we were seated right away. it was pretty crowded and we had just beat the lunch rush. theres tons of flat screens throughout the restaurant so its good if you want to go there to catch a game. not so good if you're trying to talk to a friend. maybe it was just today that there was a really obnoxious loud mouth yelling every 5 minutes. but i guess that should be expected at a sports bar. the food was pretty standard. the chicken strips were pretty good. but it took forever to get our food. service was lacking. we only saw our waitress when she took our order and when we got the check. she never came to check on us at all.
0,"Rant Alert!!\n\nOk I am a huge Starbucks fan and a loyal customer. I love my home store and this is not about them. I am not usually one to complain, however, now I have to. So listen up because today was just ridiculous...... again. \n\nEvery Saturday is the same nightmare at this Starbucks store. Not just once in a while, but every time I have been in there. My gym, LVAC, is located there and I go on Saturday mornings for Zumba and afterwards I get a Greek yogurt with honey and granola. This store just finished construction making it 2 or 3 times as big as it was. But I ask you WHY? Management is inept and unable to lead or schedule shifts and has never been able to staff this store correctly. There is always a long, looooooong wait. Not necessarily because of a long line either. There are never enough people working EVER at any time that I have been in there over the past 3 or more years. It pisses me off when I see one person behind the counter taking orders and then fulfilling the orders. That means, if the customer at the register orders five sandwiches, heated, with five drinks and a pound of coffee ground finely please, you're screwed for a good 10 minutes. That's absurd! That's money lost! Bar-backs people! There should be two people behind the counter at all times that do nothing but fulfill orders. PERIOD. This location needs to send in secret shoppers to see just how much money this store is losing because of poor staffing and management. Hand over fist I tell you! There is no sense of urgency to sell and this team does not work together. People going on breaks when there are 10 people in line is bad management, bad scheduling and bad for business. \n\nSomeone needs to get upper management involved toute suite. Or ask me, a dedicated customer, how to streamline your operation to work for ME. You heard me........."
0,Yuck!  I swear I used to love the grilled cheese sandwhich and tater tots.  The food has just been disgusting the last 3 times I went.  I will NOT be going back.  The grilled cheese has hardly any cheese in it.  Texas toast with a butter smearing amount of cheese between the two slices.  The tater tots taste cold and stale like they have been sitting around for hours.  Ick.
1,Great food for an extremely reasonable price!  We will be making the trip back to Scottsdale soon!
1,"The first place I've found in AZ in my 20 years here that truly reminds me of the seafood places I grew up with on the east coast.  Great, laid back atmosphere with wonderful staff (and the seafood was excellent).  We'll be visiting this place often!"
0,"This is the worst Jack in the Box around.  The customer service at this place is consistently terrible, to the point that I stopped going long ago.  Half the issue is having employees whose English is unintelligible.  If you can't understand English - which is the language of this land (last time I checked, anyway), how is a person reasonably expected to be able to correctly take an order?  One time I was there, I asked for 2 Jumbo Jacks, hold the mayo.  I had to repeat myself 4 times to the attendant before they finally understood.  When I got home, the burgers were slathered with mayonnaise.  \nAnother time I got 2 regular burgers instead of the sandwich I had ordered.\nAnother time, apparently it was a shift change and I stood there for several minutes, waiting for someone to help me. All of the employees were RIGHT there, completely ignoring customers at the counter.  \nThe last time I went, I again requested no mayo.  This time, however, when they handed me my bag full of food, I opened it up and laid it all out on the counter and then began opening each item (I was buying for 4 teenagers besides myself, I had a lot of food there).  My burgers were again slathered with mayo.  I called the manager of this store a couple of times hoping they might be able to get this place in order, but that dream never materialized.  I no longer go to this Jack in the Box and go to the one at 24th Street and Baseline instead (MUCH better service there with people that actually speak English!)."
0,"This rating is tough because the beer is stellar but Im not a huge fan of the food. I feel its average bar food. Most everything is just ok, and there is just one really good item(beer battered fries). I would recommend getting a growler or two and drinking it with some friends at home."
1,"This classic french restaurant is a jewel in the desert.  An unexpected pleasure located in Cave Creek, amongst the eclectic mix of country and rock n' roll bars.  \n\nThe Oysters Rockefeller were delicious, the Chateaubriand with Hollandaise sauce was lean, tender and flavorful, and the Grand Marnier Souffle is always decadent and cooked to perfection.\n\nThe decor is very dated, but this is to me what gives the place so much charm.  It's a little bit of France, in the desert.  There is nothing pretencious about this place.  \n\nLove it!  It was a great place to enjoy my last meal of 2010."
1,"I've been to their restaurants in Dallas and they were just ok.  But in Vegas, I see what In-N-Out is all about and why it's worth all of the hype.  Spotlessly clean restaurant, friendly employees, and the food was freshly cooked and cooked to order.  Definitely worth the hype.  Here's hoping that the rumored new locations in Austin can live up to Vegas standards.   A special thanks for real iced tea with real lemons!"
0,"This was the worst service/ breakfast spot I have ever been to in my 10 yrs in Las Vegas! I heard the food was good and being a huge breakfast foodie I wanted to try it for myself. We went late on a Sunday morning. It was packed and we waited for almost an hr to be seated inside after being told there was only a 20 min wait to begin with. I can deal with that. Here's what I can't understand, sitting for 20 mins without having a single waiter come over for food orders or even drinks. I had to go back to the hostess and ask her if we had a waiter assigned. 5 tables that came in after us were served and got their food before us! I was told by the waitress that finally came over that our waiter got backed up and that's why he didn't come over so she was now helping us without any apologies. I dislike this place very much, food was okay, nothing special not worth the wait or stress. I was charged incorrectly in the end too. I will never come back and tell everyone I know to skip this place, it's horrible...should have went up the street to island flavor instead!"
1,I love this place. Dan & his wife are very helpful. My dogs eat healthier than me. Cow cheeks and Pig ears are like Doggie Crack. my dogs go crazy when they see me walking up with a small brown bag.
0,"Unfortunately, you are limited to where you can dine at Terminal 2 in the Phoenix airport for breakfast.  Fast food or this steaming pile of dog poop.\n\nDirty... tables aren't wiped.  The servers clear food off the tables onto the floor using their hands.  Nice.\n\nExtremely limited breakfast menu.  Yes, they have eggs.  But only scrambled.  Paper plates and plasticware so thin make sure you get a few extra sets as the first set will surely break.\n\nSurlly, disheveled, and disgruntled employees.\n\nYou're better off down the hall at Round Table pizza for breakfast.  At least it's clean!"
0,"I was pretty excited to check this out as found trucks are a rarity in Montreal. There's a wide selection of food, but practically nothing for vegetarians (a spring roll, and a terrible looking tofu \""thing\""). Green Panther has a truck there, but I live two blocks from their restaurant downtown so its a bit of a wasted trip for the limited menu.\n\nThe smell of deep frying is a bit overwhelming too; I won't be back and wish I could get my metro fare refunded."
0,"I have to admit. I have never heard of this place. A friend of mine, his dad was playing there. They were busy in the Restaurant, but had a few tables on the back patio empty. So we went back to the patio where we had people waiting for us and there were actually 2 additional people there as well who were not eating, but when the server walked by I tried to order and he told me I would have to wait 30 minutes because that is the waiting time. \nWell by the time I told my friend's dad who was singing there, we finally got served our food. It was pretty good and a decent price. The Owner seemed to be a real nice guy, but his employees were terrible, awful. I always give a place a second chance otherwise I would have only given them one star."
1,"Not sure what the bad reviews are about. I did only just move in this weekend, but so far I'm elated! The apartment is really amazing. The view is phenomenal. Yes, it's an older building, but I'd rather think of it as classic Vegas! The amenities are great, and so far everybody I've met, neighbors and staff, are very friendly. The staff has gone out of their way to make my move into the building as smooth as possible. Maintenance seems to be within an earshot if I need them for anything. The neighborhood is obviously not the greatest or safest in Vegas, but you don't have to move in here to realize that. As long as you're in the building you're pretty safe. They went to great lengths to secure the property from unwanted guests.\nBottom line is that I knew what to expect moving in here. It's not Summerlin. This is my first time living this close to the inner city, and it's perfect for my current situation. Number one factor was that they accepted my pit bull (upon meeting her). Secondly, I'm not having to deal with the witch hunts of intrusive HOAs and nosey neighbors with sticks up their asses. I feel very comfortable here, and foresee no major issues that would convince me that I haven't made the right choice moving in. And it has to be said again, I'm looking out my windows right now and I'm just in awe of this view!!"
1,My experience with this office was amazing!!! Karissa just recently contacted me about my insurance (which to be honest i wasnt even looking at the time) and was able to get me a great deal. She really explained what coverages i had and recommended some changes for my benefit (which Geico had never done for me). If your ever looking for an agent to take care of your needs and make you feel confident call this office and ask for Karissa!!!! Once i get my finances in order ill get life insurance with her too ;) Very proffessional and great customer service. I am definately sending my friends and family their way!!
1,"Great friendly owners,amazing brats and dogs!! Our kids cant wait to go!!"
1,"Having been to this area before for a different restaurant, I was surprised to see that Cornish Pasty Co. was in a place I was familiar with. With an unsuspecting exterior, this place had a modern homey feel to it when I walked in. The only thing I have to complain about is the schoolroom carpet: one color, thin and boring. The old church pews that served as booths were a plus -- I definitely thought they were charming. Lastly, make sure your butt pockets don't have buttons. The bar stools will eat them.\n\nI have never been to a pub. I didn't know what to expect when it came to the food, let alone was pasties were like. The wait for your food is worth it. I ordered the Bangers and Mash (pork sausage with sage, cut into cubes topped with rich mashed potatoes); my mom had their garden salad. I'm assuming her dressing was excellent because no sooner so I see her dip a cucumber into it, she's pouring the whole thing all gun ho'.\n\nCornish Pasty Co. offers a wide variety of options; even a whole section dedicated to those that are partial to vegetarianism. I didn't see their dessert options, but am aware that they offer them, as a couple behind me were enjoying something sweet. Also, their alcohol selection was highly varied from your typical bar fare to more ethnic choices.\n\nI will be sure to stop by this location when the sun sets for dinner because as it stands, it's too hot to enjoy a lunch there."
0,"Not the best Subway I've been to, service was slow and well it is Arizona. Clean location though."
0,"A group of girls and I visited this place for Calvin Harris last weekend during a bachelorette party and while the night started off on a fantastic note, things quickly turned sour as the night wore on. Let me break it down for you.\n\nPros:\n- We contacted a promoter who directed us to the manager who led us into a ladies only line. Since we had our names on the guestlist, we were quickly ushered through the line with little trouble\n- We got to take the elevators up to the main floor and during the night, the very nice elevator man let us take the elevators up and down from the hip hop room (3rd floor) to the main floor (4th floor)\n- Upon entering the club, we were greeted warmly by many workers\n- Bars in the hip hop room remained pretty empty making it easy to buy drinks quickly\n\nCons:\n- TINY dance floor on both the main EDM floor and hip hop floor = massive crowding, uncomfortable dancing, unwelcome sweat exchanging between strangers\n- Had to arrive early in order to get in (before 10pm - which by vegas standards is practically the break of dawn)\n- We had one girl arriving late to the club and was originally ensured by the promoter she would be on the list and have no problems getting in.... WRONG! We paid expedited entry ($60) for our one girl and then got yelled at, cursed at and berated by the bouncers, head security and guestlist girl. I've NEVER been treated in such a manner before, especially after paying the expedited entry fee willingly.\n- The main EDM floor was so incredibly packed, we couldn't see Calvin Harris when he finally came on stage around 1:30am. We ended up leaving since there was nowhere to stand, nowhere to dance, and nowhere to sit.\n\nBottom line: beautiful club, the little you get to see of it. If you come early and are a group of only girls, entrance is easy but don't expect hospitality or service from the people who work the entrance. Even if I had the $5k to buy a table here, I'd refuse to come back, simply because of the way they treat people here."

1,"WOW! The wife ordered the chicken and black bean combo con queso and I got the sante fe chili and rice. We also ordered and split 10 hot wings. The chicken and black bean combo con queso is boneless, skinless rotisserie chicken served over our herb rice and topped with queso which I have to say after tasting it my wife threatened to stab me with her fork if I tried to get anymore. The sante fe chili and rice was homemade beef chili served over rice and topped with our queso sauce. Man this stuff was stick to your ribs goodness. The wings were the type we loved which had a crispness to them and the sauce was divine. They have other sauces there to try which are also very yummy. We had a wonderful time there and will most definitely be back."
0,Insipidly sweet big frosting on top of  stale cake. Pretty to look at - but stop there. I wish they were closed when I went by on FLW Blvd. \n\nService was less than uninspired
1,"I would definitely have to give a 5/5 stars for MGM based on my experience here.  I booked a complimentary  room through myVegas (facebook game that gives real Vegas prizes).  Upon arrival, I noticed the extremely long line of people waiting to check in.  This was at 6:00 pm too!  I waited for about ten to fifteen minutes until I could talk to a representative to check in.  I started to chat it up with the person that was helping me check in.  I asked him if he had any complimentary upgrades available; perhaps a larger room.  I was expecting him to say he did not have anything available because the hotel seemed so busy.  He asked me to give him a minute.  A minute passes and he tells me to hold on some more.  He leaves the desk and comes back five minutes later.  When he comes back, he tells me he has upgraded me to the a grand towers' suite room!  I was in shock that he hooked it up, because I had tried the same thing at Aria, and she shot me down rather quickly.  After that, I gave him a $20 and darted to the room.  \n\nThe room itself was all the way at the end of the 10th floor, which is good, because all the good rooms are at the end of the halls.  When I opened the doors, I was greeted with a living room with a table, couches, chairs, lamps, and a flat screen t.v.  I then opened the cellular shades with the panel on the wall, and was amazed by the fantastic view of the many hotels and casinos on the strip.  After that, I walked into the bathroom and found his and her sinks, as well as a tub, and a separate shower.  After making my way past the bathroom, I found the master bedroom.  The view was not as spectacular as from the living room though.  However, there was yet another t.v., as well as a table.  This was definitely one awesome room.  \n\nAs for the hotel itself, parts are outdated, and other areas have been remodeled.  I think it is a hit and miss regarding their rooms.  I have read horrible reviews, and others being very positive.  \n\nAll in all, I had a very good experience for my first time staying here.  Thank you kind sir for upgrading us for free, even when we already had a free room.  It was greatly appreciated!"
0,negative 5 star... store #313 (underwear store in the premium outlet). \n\nworst service and they forgot to apply 20% discount. for an over priced underwear. most of the time you can find the same product at ross and marshalls. dont pay for their over price crap. \n\nthere were three associates working and none helped until i had to call their attention. they were having a great time having inappropriate conversations while at work.  now i called saying they forgot to apply the discount and now i have to go in the store so they can give me money they owe me.. \n\nstore manager is fred- ill be talking to him in the next couple days..
0,"If I could give a ZERO, I would.  We had the prime rib last night and it tasted awful!  In fact, it tasted old.  The food is definitely not worth the money.  The only thing good about the experience was the service.  I was with someone that has been going to this restaurant over 30 years and they say they have never tasted such bad food from this place...yes, even their food tasted just average or old.  Perhaps quality control isn't what it used to be?  I think this will be the last time for me."
1,"This is a great place to make a quick stop for coffee, snacks, or bathroom--not listed in any order.  I am impressed how clean the areas are always kept.  \n\nIt's an easy off/on from the freeway.  It's not my normal gas up place, but it's a super stop for me.\n\nThere's a not a whole lot to say about a Petro Center except they're pretty darn good!"
0,"I think honesty is sometimes the best policy.   We had a backyard block wall that had to be destroyed and a gate put in its placed.  I called First Impression in mid April.  They looked at the project, and gave me an estimate for construction of the gate.   They said they'd give me a call for the estimate on demo of the block wall.   It is now mid june, and haven't heard anything from them.  I then had Great Gates scheduled for an estimate 3 weeks after First Impression.  They provided a detailed estimate, I went ahead with the project and they've been mailing me updates.   Needless to say who I will go with for our $10k+ front double iron entry door project.  It won't be First Impression."
0,I ordered a breakfast burrito and a latte TO GO.\n\nThe burrito was delivered in less than 5 minutes. After that I sat and waited an additional 10 minutes for the latte. There were 4 people waiting for coffee when I ordered. \n\nI get it that they take their coffee seriously here but 15 minutes for a latte when it's dead?? \n\nBurrito was ruined/inedible because the potatoes were basically raw.
1,"On my monthly trip around the state of Arizona I tend to stay in Goodyear once a month.  I keep finding my way back to Rudy's.  They don't advertise gluten free but do have a lot of choices for any allergies.  Ask at the front desk they have a laminated allergy menu,  including dairy,  soy,  gluten and sulfites too.  Food is great.   I have tried the ribs,  sausages,  brisket,  potato salad and the cole slaw.  They have real food and always fill me up.  I have never been disappointed here.   I love the Chandler location too.   Will happily return."
1,"I have been in the LV  since December 2013, and I still love this station! My wish is that really dig into the crates and play some stuff that hasn't been heard in a long while! Examples: slave, New birth, I heard a kc and the sunshine band song that noone played in ages and I heard it on 88.1. Yes, I have discovered the other station! I still love this station but Tuesday and Thursday is 88.1. I know you guys can step it up."
1,"excellent bartender! nice place. the food is a hit or miss, some is good some is not, most of the specials, stay away from. get the menu food, it's much bettter, but still be choosy. the bagel sandwich is a must have breakfast sandwich! and the chicken parm sandwich special is a must stay away from not good sandwitch at all! but go try this place, it's cool. and go to the bar, you'll usually get excellent service especially if it's Bill!"
1,"Came for lunch today with a friend.  We both wanted at least 2 rolls and didn't want to go broke paying for them.  Quality was good. Service was a little slow.. there was only 1 waitress hopping between all of the tables, and they were all filled up by the time we were done eating.\n\nWe both had AYCE for $19 with an iced tea each.  With tax it came to $22.11.  I ordered a 911 roll, shrimp tempura roll and a spider roll.  All 3 were very good.  Wish I had saved money for tempura ice cream.  I'll be coming back for dinner which is $22 for AYCE with my husband one night in the future."
1,"So we don't normally wait until 5 for dinner so it is really hard for us to make it to Tuck Shop.  Thankfully, we were off this past week and were able to finally go on a Friday evening.  We showed up at 5 and we were pretty much the only ones there for a while.\n\nBig positives for having the baseball game on in the bar & for our waiter being pretty awesome.  I had seen in a tweet that they had a BBQ pork sandwich that I just had to try and it was really the only thing on my mind.  All of the nonsense about sharing and tapas was completely lost on me.\n\nWe did order what amounted to fried cheese sticks.  They were okay.  They were made with fontina cheese and the sticks were pretty good but the sauces just didn't do it for me.  One of them was even pear-flavored.  Ugh.\n\nThe wife also wanted to try the mac & cheese with \""lobstah\"" so we got an order of that.  It was pretty good but was served too hot.  I know that sounds weird, but the cheese was all runny when we got it.  It wasn't until we were about finished that it turned into a creamy mac & cheese.  Too bad.\n\nAll of those complaints aside, I really didn't go for that stuff.  I went for the bbq.  Considering I had tried about 3 different bbq porks over the previous three days, I was beginning to consider myself an expert on the stuff.  The Tuck Shop bbq was wicked good.  It came with sweet potato fries that rivaled Fez (they were even cinnamon-sugary too).  The sauce was a bit spicy and really wasn't needed considering how juicy the pork was.  Really, it was great.  It was a special though, so don't show up looking for it on the menu.\n\nFinally, we finished out our meal with a German chocolate cheesecake.  I'm not sure why I ordered this; I hate German chocolate and I can't eat cheesecake...but I ate some of it anyways.  It was so good.  Really one of the better desserts I've had.  \n\nTo top this all off, I had ordered some lemonade which was actually really good.  I guess they make the syrups there in-house and, while not a traditional lemonade, it was pretty damn good and had free refills.  No complaints there.  Next time, I'm getting the ginger ale."
1,"A very nice traditional French bakerie & deli. They have fresh baguette, rolls, desserts, cold case with cheeses, pates, and duck confit. \nWe got a very nice cheese and spinach quiche. They boxed it up with string. Great customer service and wonderful quality."
0,"travelodge would have been the same but a lot less expensive experience. not worth the money i spent staying here i was there jan-11-jan 14. the rooms were smelly, a huge watermark on the ceiling from the room upstairs. check out time isn't till 11 why did a hotel employee check in the room at 9am. decor was awful i saw dusk & cob web everywhere. hotel halls felt like cardboard, elevators were all scratched up like a homeless person lived in it. my view was of a underconstruction pool, an huge bird poop on the window. what am i paying a daily hotel fee $18 per day for? mistake mistake.. the ony good thing about this place is the buffet deal they have with excalibur two buffets $35 all day. but that also has its down side youhave to make your way back to where you were to eat, or stay in that area an wait till your hungry. i could not for the life of me find a cocktail waitress."
1,"Are you ready for this?  My car was making undiagnosed noise from the brake system on an intermittent basis.  I called this company after reading Yelp reviews.  Kris told me to bring it in now if I had a couple of hours.  I did.  It was less than an hour when he came to tell me that from a safety stand point, all was OK.  If I had any other problems just to give him a call.  NOW! the shocker.  There was no charge.  No charge!!.  They have a new customer for all my auto needs in the future.  I also noticed a $15 dollar Smog check feel was standard.\nIn times of really poor service in so many places this was just a delight. Thank you Kris and the staff.  I'll be back."
1,Went here last night and I'm still thinking about my meal!  Hands down best vegan place I've ever been too! Can't wait to come back when I'm in Tempe.  I'm from NY and haven't found anyplace that comes close to this place! Yum!!!
1,"The salon has recently come under new management, and all I can say is how great it has become! I booked a 50-minute Swedish/Deep Tissue Massage last week and it was one of the best I have ever received. The atmosphere in the massage room is so quiet and peaceful it's like you're in a completely different place! The therapist found knots I never even knew I had and got me to relax more than I have been able to in a long time.  I also have frequent headaches that no amount of Advil can help with and within the first ten minutes of the massage, he had my headache gone! I will definitely keep coming back for massages at Kharizma Salon and Day Spa! :)"
0,"I came through this dive while pub-crawling amongst friends. As we lined up at the bar to order beers and grub -- the bartender's muttering under her breath \""oh shit.\"" should have tipped us off to the piss poor service that awaited us. Apparently they're not accustomed to seeing a group of ~12 people waltz in this dump. Go fig'. Mind you, we were very accommodating, and considerate of the surprise rush we created. However, when they served our table separately and completely forgot my food, I was forced to demand a refund. They're lucky I wasn't a complete a**hole and demanded the portion of the tip that I already paid toward my food order.\n\nSure, if you're looking for a very lonely dive all to yourself and a /few/ friends, this might be your place. But for us, it was a complete and utter disaster.\n\nOh, did I mention the incessant flies throughout the establishment? Yeah, not cool."
1,"I told myself that on my next trip to Vegas, I was gonna try one of the nicer buffets on the Strip. My husband & I stayed at Paris, and it was a choice between Wicked Spoon and The Buffet. While I was intrigued by Wicked Spoon's mac and cheese bar, we went to the Bellagio.\n\nWe waited in line for about 45 minutes on a Monday night. It was worth the wait. The prime rib was awesome; the Kobe sirloin was even better. The cold shrimp was fresh, and the pasta had lots of flavor. Even the sea bass was good, and I never eat sea bass. I tried four of their desserts: my favorite was the tiramisu. The only thing I didn't like much was the shrimp in the paella, but that's a very minor quibble. \n\nOverall: great food, our server was really nice, even when she forgot my water, and it was definitely the best buffet we'd ever eaten at (at this point, anyway). It's definitely worth the splurge... although the Friday/Sat. prices seem a bit steep."
0,"Staff is poorly trained and bad attitude. They charged me the wrong price on my item and claimed it didn't matter what the menu board said, the register had a different price. When they finally agreed to refund the $1 difference, there was no apology, Just a look of \""how dare youdesire to be charged the correct price.\"" Food was so-so."

I don't have a lot to say but feel like I should add something brief as it was quite enjoyable!\nMy dining partners had the tasting menu but as I am not a big seafood fan I went with a few choices off of the regular menu (including the fois gras and a pork belly dish for my main course (seems that it's no longer available)).  Everyone was very pleased with the attentive service - they even covered up our plates with these silver covers when we went to the bathroom.  All the food was very delicious, I loved every part of my meal.  If it weren't for the multitude of other top foodie choices in Vegas, I would definitely visit here again.  I hope to return someday!  Oh, and yeah, the wine tower thing is pretty cool too...."
1,"The food = Amazing. \nThe Ambiance = dark, cozy and intimate.\nService = Cool, but not very impressionable from what I've experienced.\nDrinks = great cocktails and great selection of pitchers of mojitos and sangrias.\n\nCome here for cocktails with friends.  Great place for a date night with the lover.  Celebrate something special here.  Compared to the other location on Paradise this place in bigger, better and convenient since it's in my area.  \n\nFavorites: \n-Chorizo and clams = 5 star\n-Stuffed dates wrapped in bacon = 5 stars\n-Veggie empanada = 5 stars\n-Petite filet = 5 stars\n-Shrimp ceviche = 4 stars\n-Carmel flan = 4 stars\n-Red Sangria = 5 stars\n\nTRY ALL OF THEM! You will fall in love with this place."
1,"Nestled in the middle of the Town & Country shopping center is Pizzeria Bianco. There weren't any signs telling you that it was located there so I just happened upon it with some help from great Yelp friends. With all the word of mouth I'd. Heard about this place I was excited to try it.  \n\nWe met some friends there around six and didn't have a wait to be seated. Being seated at the only round white table there and the short chairs made me feel like I was eating at the little kids table at the family holiday dinners I had as a kid.  The place itself was a little small but they make good use of their space.  The place felt cozy and like it was your second home, with a few unknown strangers dining with you.   Our table though was located a little too close to the door and wood fired oven.  \n\nThe wait staff was very friendly and answered all questions promptly. She was even able to provide a recommendation on menu choices.  I really like it when the wait staff knows their menu. Although we had to request the bread and oil. The pizza was your typical thin crust fire baked pizza. I ordered the rosa pizza which had onions and pistachios. A very yummy and interesting combination.  The only downside to the evening was the menu itself. There are two pages devoted to wine beer and spirits but only one for food options. There were only 6 pizza options, 2 pasta choices and a few salad options."
1,"Freakin awesome, for Vegas.\n\nRooms are top notch.  Best in town.\n\nRoom service is marginal at best.  Don't order breakfast if you have to be anywhere before noon.\n\nFitness center is very nice.  Spa is AWESOME."
1,"First time here and so far the waitresses are nice and attentive. My drink came as soon as I placed it. It's about 2 pm and it's not too busy. The decor is cute, I don't know why I like it. Food came out fast and it looks pretty good I'm gonna demolish this! Ok the pork belly is really good. The bao is warm and soft and the pork belly is crispy and the flavor is yummy. I ate it so fast I forgot to chew. This peanut lodged in the back of my throat is totally worth it! :) pot stickers are done well. Overall I'm really happy I picked this place for lunch."
1,Came in late on a Wednesday night about 30 min before closing. This was not my first choice as I was hoping to try some authentic French montreal food. Unfortunately most closed by 10 pm. \n\nIt was late and I didn't want a big meal. Server suggested ribs or a salad but these were fairly large portions so I went with the appetizer portion of chicken tenders and an iced tea. The ice tea came in a very small glass probably less than 6 oz. it also tasted like what you get from a Lipton or nestea canned drink which is horrible. At $3 it was not a good value. So I didn't have high expectations for my chicken tenders. Boy was I pleasantly surprised!  The tenders were not dry and came with plenty of fries to complement. It was definitely an above average dish. \n\nKudos on the chicken tenders but thumbs down on the ice tea. Thanks for staying open. Server was also friendly and courteous.
0,"This motel has good cheap rates, but you get what you paid for, the motel has been remodel, they gave the lobby a modern look. Front office was very friendly and when we checked in we were approaching our room and there was a strong smell of marijuana and our room was way down the hall it gave me the creeps, so me and my husband went back to the front desk and they gave us another room, this has been the first and last time we stay at this motel. The only best thing about this motel is that Ellis Island restaurant and casino is right next to it."
1,"Dear Vig Hater,\n\nIf you don't like going to places with snobby, \""Scottsdale\"" patrons, don't pick a restaurant/bar that looks trendy, has trendy menu descriptions, and describes itself as a \""modern tavern.\"" If you want something more laidback, find yourself a local spot with a more casual feel and leave the Vig alone!\n\nChristine\n\nDear Christine,\n\nIt's definitely possible that a trendy place draws a crowd who either is or considers themselves trendy, but I have another problem with the Vig: it's in a sketchy neighborhood! I don't feel comfortable coming here at night or parking next to the check cashing place. \n\nVig Hater\n\nDear Vig Hater, \n\nThe area around the Vig borders Arcadia, considered one of the nicest neighborhoods in Phoenix. I wonder where you live that you consider this area \""ghetto.\"" If you have an aversion to check cashing joints and Circle Ks, I strongly suggest you never make the field trip to Pizza A Metro.\n\nChristine\n\nDear Christine,\n\nBut isn't the food at the Vig not that great?\n\nVig Hater\n\nDear Vig Hater,\n\nThere, I'm going to have to meet you in the middle. My veggie sandwich (called \""The Vigan\"") with a side of sweet potato fries was really well-prepared, but I can see some of the other dishes being more amusingly-named than well-executed. Since this place is only two minutes from my office, I plan to go back for happy hour or dinner. I will definitely update when I do. \n\nChristine\n\nTO BE CONTINUED..."
1,"Last week, I came in late...an hour before closing...with a battery problem.  Seeing that I was in a suit, an employee named Enrique H. offered to help install the battery.  Additionally, he was extremely polite and very helpful.  Working nearby, I have been to this store on several occasions and never once been disappointed with the quality and courtesy of service...really, it is outstanding!  Will return often."
0,"So disappointed! I ordered one meal + sides for pick up...the total should've been around $26 according to their online menu. Somehow the total came to $39?!? The prices were completely different...not to mention the markup because they were out of chicken and substituted brisket. Unfortunately the food didn't make the increase worth it. The ribs were fatty, cornbread was dry, and the pulled pork was bland. One redeeming item was the Mac n cheese. I'm kicking myself for not questioning the pricing when I picked up the meal, but it's water under the bridge."
1,"I love that Japan is a world of nonsense and absurdity. I fully embrace things like a restaurant only playing ABBA. And if that is what you are looking for, then Tokyo Japanese Restaurant completely delivers on that front. The sushi and other dishes are all solid, but nothing really blew me away. And for that reason, if it was not for the great and friendly service (and the ABBA), I would give this joint three stars. The service was so spot-on, with all of the staff willing to help out on anything you may need. We went with the all-you-can-eat menu, which has a great variety of apps, dishes, and sushi. At $27 a person, it is a fairly decent deal, and let's you order at will. Insider Tip: If you are the height of a normal American male, watch your head on the hanging lanterns."
0,"I wanted to like this place, a local gastropub, what could be better? It started well, good cocktail for me and the husband had wine. Nice selection of both--not your average lists. Then we ordered the cheeseboard--and was happy with not only the amount of cheese but the meats as well. Here's where we should have stopped and walked away. I would have given it 4 stars at that point. But then we all ordered dinner--bad choice. I ordered the chicken dish...was supposed to be stuffed with Brie and apples, don't remember finding either, and after a few bites in, found the chicken wasn't cooked all the way. Yikes! The sides were nothing to sing about either, some lettuce with a little dressing, and some cooked spinach. For $15 I would have expected more. Everyone else ordered prime rib, which was a small cut, and had nothing fancy about the sides. Lastly, we ordered the ice cream: salted caramel. When they said Salted, they meant it! I think they forgot the caramel. Was really bad. They did take off the charge for both my raw chicken and the salt ice cream, but that left a bad taste in my mouth....literally. If you go---stick to happy hour or a late night drink and appetizer with friends! Those were decent--and the staff was very friendly."
1,"I have used GYMO twice and they really went out of there way to make things easy. I think I speak for just about everyone when I say moving is one of the most miserable ways to spend a weekend. It's stressful, time consuming, the constant fear of something being broken, having to call and inconvenience friends and family for help, and if you are like me your body is sore for a week afterwards. GYMO relived all those negative aspect that go along with moving as soon as I contacted them.  I am a guy who typically doesn't like hiring other people if it is something I can do on my own but after my experience with GYMO I won't consider renting a truck and doing it myself ever again. Once you see how efficient and safely they move your belongings it becomes apparent this is a job that should be left to professionals. \n\nI highly recommended GYMO."
1,"We are glad we decided to stay at Apex International.  We stayed for two nights and since this was our first trip to Edinburgh, we didn't really know what to expect.  We picked Apex International because it was in Old Town (where we wanted to stay) and the price was very reasonable.  \n\nWe arrived via an over night sleeper train from London, so we actually arrived at the hotel really early, like 8 AM early.  We didn't expect to get a room until after 3 PM, their check in time, and had just wanted to leave our luggage at the hotel so we can tour around town.  But the receptionist desk clerks were super friendly and looked for a room for us.  In fact, they took several extra minutes because they said some parts of the hotel is under renovation and they wanted to make sure we are not disturbed.  So though we weren't expecting to get a room that early, we certainly were very appreciative that we did.  It really helped to get to relax in a room, refresh a little, before going back out to tour the city.\n\nOur short stay at Apex International was a very pleasant one.  They hotel clerk asked if we needed any directions or help with any attraction booking.  Every time I asked them a question, ranging from where to get stamps to leaving our luggage after we checked out, I've had really pleasant and friendly staff members.  \n\nWe did feel a bit hot in the room (and this was toward the end of November) so we left the window slightly opened and cooled the room a bit because we couldn't find the control to turn the heater off.  It's probably more of a personal preference because we usually like our room very cold.  Since we only were staying there for two nights, we didn't bother with getting maintenance to come.  Other than that, our room was very spacious and the bed comfortable and we'd definitely consider staying here again if we are to travel to Edinburgh in the future."
1,"Tasty stuff! I had tacos and menudo, and was not disappointed. Prices seem fair.. especially if you order a daily special-"
0,"Sky Harbor is overrun with Burger Kings. Been to a few of them and they're all the same, pretty much. It's just like any other Burger King, which we all know is the king of burgers. But this one is in an airport. That makes it so much more exciting!"
0,"Food is usually good. It is loud, get a booth if you can so you can hear the person you are with. Don't depend on much service and you will be happy. It is a bar like atmosphere, lots of TVs, the games are on, people are yelling, kids are yelling, don't plan on going there to chill out and all is good. Tried this place for a second time on Saturday again got a table next to a screaming kid. When they cleared the table the they flung food at us.  I am not sure if they just employ young people that just don't care or if the noise is so loud it makes them all crazy. I was so stressed out from the noise I put on my headset and listened to music....Never again!!"
1,"Carnevino is a great steakhouse at a great property in Las Vegas. I was suggested this place by a good friend and it lived up to the hype. All courses were excellent, from the calamari to their in-house made peanut butter in the peanut butter torte everything was spot on!\n\nI had the New York strip which was bone-in and prepared just right. The meat near the bone was very flavorful and the waiter encouraged me to pick it up and eat off the bone caveman style!\n\nMy girl ordered the filet which I had to try on principal. The cut was also flavorful and melted in your mouth.\n\nFor sides, we had the mashed potatoes which comes with a fried-egg folded in to the dish, the eggplant and brussel sprouts. All of which added a great and flavorful compliment to the meat.\n\nFinally, the dessert was an unexpected cap to a great meal so I highly suggest trying to peanut butter torte.\n\nOur server was Julio and his helper was Michelle (I believe); both very knowledgable and added to a great experience.\n\nAlso, one must remember this is an Italian steakhouse so they also serve many pasta dishes and other meats like veal and lamb. That said, the cuts of beef may seem limited compared to other places.\n\nOverall, I put Carnevino on the same level with any other steakhouse in Vegas.\n\nThanks,\n-Matt-"
1,"First time here during the summer. I came during the night, wasn't as packed as I expected. The service and food was served fast. The burgers itself were amazingly delicious. Definitely worth the money and trip there. It's cheap and the place was clean, the food was fresh and it had a friendly atmosphere."
0,"Is it possible to give zero stars?\n\nIf so, I would.\n\nMy friend and I had comped day passes to check out the spa, and decided if we liked it, we would stay and get a massage and pedicure.\n\nWe left after 10 minutes.  First of all, check in was completely unprofessional.  The locker facility at my LVAC location is nicer than the women's changing room here.  The outdoor hydrotherapy pool was closed, there were 2 bugs in the steam room, the showers out by the plunge pools were closed, and about 6 of the workout machines were out of order.\n\nWe got of there quickly and decided to go to Red Rock next week, which is one of my favorites.  I'll let you know how it goes, but ANYTHING would be better than Aquae Sulis."
0,"Thought this might be fun to try on a our trip to Vegas but I would definitely give this a miss. We ordered a lot of the dumplings (not great, and I know dumplings!), plus some noodle dishes, a soup (bland broth) and the Mongolian lettuce salad (the vinegar was overpowering and the sauce gluggy, as if it was out of a bottle).\n\nWe then had some tacos and these were much better (especially the carnitas and duck tongue). The Cosmopolitan seems to be full of hen's weekends so the restaurant was full of big bridal shower groups, not our scene."
1,"If you love Mexican food, I totally recommend this spot. The food is amazing and the service is great. \n\nThe first time I came here I wasn't sure if I'd like the food and plus it was a Friday night, at least the wait wasn't too long (about 20 min) and hey it was happy hour. \n\nWhen we sat down, the server approached us and introduced herself and took our drink orders. I wasn't too sure what to try because they all seemed delicious. I ended up ordering the Ribeye Tacos...YUM! My cousin ordered the tamales and I had a little sample...totally worth trying.\n\nThe second time I came here I tried the Quesa Tacos because the server said it was one of the best items on the menu and I wouldn't be let down. He was right!! I ordered the Quesa Tacos with carne asada with a side of queso rice; I totally recommend trying it and trust me you can probably share because the tacos are pretty filling and the rice is amazing. \n\nThe third time I came here I tried the shrimp tacos (grilled), yeah I don't recommend it at all just because it was salty and just not that great. However, my cousin ordered the Empanadas and had a little bite of it and it was really good. \n\nBTW if you check if you get a free fried ice cream, so make sure you check in and show your server because dessert is a perfect way to end your meal."
1,"I've ate here three times in the past two weeks for lunch and have to say I LOVE the food.  Excellent service, reasonably priced full meal lunch specials with soup, crab puff, spring roll, rice and main course for under $5 (even the Shrimp dishes are under $6)\n\nI'm going to check out the dinner there soon.  I loved their Hot & Sour Soup and would recommend any of the Prawn lunch specials or the Cashew Chicken.\n\nFor your local neighborhood Chinese sit down meal, you just can't beat it for the quality, price and service.  At least that has been my two friends and my experience over multiple occasions.  My friend who lives in the neighborhood has ate here many times and recommended it to us.  Thanks, Ian!"
1,The atmosphere in this restaurant is truly authentic. The experience is a once in a lifetime opportunity. The food was great. The dancer was amazing. The wait staff friendly. The music divine. The owner amiable. Everything was perfect here. My only complaint would be the price which without a Groupon would be much to pricy to frequent too often. Go here for the experience of a lifetime
1,So glad there is a location now in my area. I have loved 5 Guys since I was first introduced to them on the East Coast.  4 starts because they are pricey for burger and fries but will be returning
0,Do not use this lady... She is not trustworthy. We were supposed to have invitations sent 6 weeks prior or the big day. We could not get a hold of her and when we did it was excuse after excuse. Finally the invites went out three weeks prior to wedding after several mistakes.
1,Came in here at about 3am. The STL was pretty chill and nice-- not like a lot of the other ones. My roomie needed some ROCKSTAR to drive back down to Tucson and thank god for this Walgreens. :D
0,Poor customer service. Unhelpful staff. Not ready to help customers find things they are looking for. Seems like they don't care about customers.
1,"This place is insane. I once ate here weekly for a month. I couldn't help it. Everything I've ever had here has been amazing. The ice cream bars, the banana tempura fondue, the banana split latte, the BALT. Everything. It's all amazing. While the service is sometimes a bit off, it never matters. As long as the chocolate is there I don't care. The restaurant even LOOKS like chocolate. There are pipes all around leading to the bar which has large tubs of milk, white, and dark chocolate. I've wondered if anyone has ever stupidly tried to break those pipes open. \n\nP.S. If you're going to come to Max Brenner, you MUST get something with chocolate in it. It makes me sad when I see people come in and order just a salad and a water. It makes me want to force feed them chocolate. Come here to indulge!"
1,"The place is 15-20min away from the main strip.  A traditional sushi restaurant that also has a $26 all-you-can-eat menu.  Overall food is very good, really enjoyed it.  Many dish were heavy on the sesame oil, but I love sesame oil so that was fine.\n\nThe GOOD: (what I liked)\nOyster shooters - puny but sweet/succulent/excellent.\nSoft Shell Crab - batter fried cruncy delicious.\nSweet shrimp - sashimi tail & fried shrimp head good.\nScallop hand roll - scallops, mayo, topped /w masago yum\nSpicy Tuna roll - it's very good luv it.\nBaked mussel - juicy, excellent.\nMasago & Ikura - small eggs/ large eggs.\nShrimp/Veggie Tempura - (the usual)\nEdmame -  (the usual)\nDessert - green tea ice-cream /w mango/strawberry mochi. Yummy!!\n\nThe BAD:\n-fish were sliced paper thin, and too much rice on the nigiri sushi.  Seriously this is just a waste since most people are not going to eat the extra rice anyways.  The thinness of the cut also impacts negatively on the overall taste/mouth feel of the nigri.\n\nThe UGLY:\n-took foreeever to get our food.  Apparently they had too many customers that day and they were short staffed.  I hope this is a one time fluke as the server apologized repeatedly. \n-many items were out of stock.  Seriously we showed up around 6:30pm yet they were already out of the good stuff like uni, giant scallops, clams, torro.. WTF\n\nNOTE:\n-everyone gets only one order of sweet shrimp & uni\n-each order of sushi comes in 2 pieces.  marking 6 orders = yup u guessed it, 12 pieces."
0,"Took two watches with a Quartz movement here to replace the batteries. The salesperson explained, in wierd used car salesman mannerisms, that the watch would be \""perfectly opened\"", the battery \""perfectly replaced\"", and the watch \""perfectly closed\"", to which I did not reply \""what other f-ing way would you do it?\"".\n\nOne was done well. However, on the other watch, it failed. They offered to send the watch to the service center. I was reluctant because the watch was fine just a day ago. Instead I replaced the battery myself and found the battery isolator had been removed causing a short in the battery. I replaced it with a makeshift and the watch now runs fine.\n\nI would leave one star, except the first watch was serviced well, and they were nice."
0,The restaurant lobby was just dirt. \nTables tops sticky.
1,"Great place, great staff! Got a simple mani for only $12 which is cheap and my friend got a full set of sparkling purple nails and that was only $30! Not too bad if you ask me! Would love to come back another time!"
0,"I guess I shouldn't have high expectations for a chain, but I was quite disappointed in this place. Went for happy hour with some friends who apparently like coming here (not sure why though). \n\nAlthough I will say that the service was awesome, the \""good\"" ends there. \n\nThe food, meh. We had some apps including calamari (kinda tough), spinach dip (I've had better), and the avocado rolls (the best out of the 3). Not super impressed with any of it. \n\nThe drinks, they were made well, but at $4.75 for WELL on HAPPY HOUR - it really didn't make me very happy at all. \n\nNext time I will go somewhere else for happy hour where the food and drink prices really do make me happy."
1,Very good bagels and sandwiches!
0,"We drive 25 minutes every time we want Qdoba. The last couple times our food has been great, but the service sucks. Employees are rude. They don't great you with the typical banter. It feels a lot like we are inconveniencing them. Not sure it's worth the drive anymore..."

1,"I love Dr. Carlsson and his staff!  I just got my third pair of glasses from him recently and each and every pair has been perfect.  Being a progressive lens wearer they can be tricky to prescribe.  \n\nDr. Carlsson takes his time with patients and very thorough. He is also friendly and highly knowledgeable and professional. We tried several pairs of contact lenses last year before deciding that my eyes were too dry to wear them for long. He even took me outside to test distance!  Who does that at a mall store?  \n\nAs for the staff...they are truly amazing.  All are courteous and sweet!  When I walk in the door it's as if they are expecting me and know me by name. I never feel like I am intruding on their day which is what I get from many other retail stores.  Keep what you're doing ladies!\n\nEyewear selection is GREAT.  I have purchased cool designer frames and their prices are in all ranges. I never feel like the staff is trying to up sell me me either.  No pressure sales is shopping happiness!\n\nMy only suggestion is could they please be open on Saturdays, or at least one Saturday per month like my dentist???  This is not a deal breaker for me, however.\n\nBottom line, go here if you want personalized, friendly service in your eye care. I know I will be going here for years to come!"
0,"Sushi is decent.  Service could calm down a little.  As soon as I am done with a dish, a waiter jumps out of nowhere to ask if I am done with the dish.  The constant interruption of a waiter asking to take an empty plate really kills the mood.  No kidding...as I am \""finishing\"" a plate of food, three waiters with 2 minutes asked if I was finished with my plate. NO, I am not.  Was there a shortage of plates?  Jeez."
1,"I would highly recommend this store without a moment's hesitation! I am totally an amateur to cycling but from the moment I walked in with questions and bike issues, the staff was incredibly helpful. They never made me feel bad for not knowing what I was doing. They have been so encouraging and their knowledge of all things bike related has already helped me while I'm out on the road. Plus! They're always cheerful no matter how busy it is, and you better believe they are going to go the extra mile (haha pun intended) to make sure your bike is in tip-top shape. Every time I bring my bike in there for something, they're looking it all over, up and down to check parts of the bike I didn't even know existed. Amateur, remember? My point is I really trust their knowledge, honesty, and commitment to the customer. Case in point: I'm writing this because I was just in there and Cindy spent over 20 minutes helping me get my bike fitted to me and didn't even charge me, so I thought i would give back by leaving a good review. Thanks Giant!"
1,"It's hard to find a non corporate coffee outlet in Las Vegas, but I found this place on Flamingo . Good coffee , not just a conversation piece. I ordered the Mocha, much better that I would have expected from a drive in. No pastries offered here, but a good choice of hot and frozen coffees."
1,This is a great little theatre. I have been to several theaters here in Charlotte and this is very similar to most. It has a great reception area for a drink before the show. I think this waste first time sitting in the balcony. I was on the right side and there were definitely parts of the stage I couldn't see. But over all it was a great experience.\n\nThe parking lot near the theatre was full so we parked at the 7th street station which was only $5 because no other events were going on.  It was only a block away.
1,"Blue 32 is my favorite place in town to watch a game (other than my living room). It's the best sports bar food I've had in the area, the booths are really comfortable and there are a ton of high quality HD TVs. I've been there for Oregon football games, which are always fun (except when we play an Arizona school), as well as Arizona basketball games and the NCAA tournament. I've also been there randomly when I'm craving their boneless wings...\n\nOne of the best memories I have in AZ was at Blue 32 watching the Sweet 16 game this year between Arizona and Duke. Seeing the roof blown off by all the U of A fans was pretty special...It reminded me of the fanaticism that I see in Oregon for Duck football. That's what's so great about Blue 32. It's not 100% crazy, but there's always a good energy going, with the occasional freakout moment when Derrick Williams throws down on what seems like the entire Duke starting 5...\n\nAs far as food goes, I love their boneless buffalo wings. They also have good onion rings and fries, and their burgers, sandwiches and salads are also pretty good. They have a great happy hour with cheap appetizer options (cheap boneless wings!!!) and good beer specials.\n\nThere's ample parking and outdoor seating as well. There isn't a bad seat in the house because they have so many TVs. Regardless of where you're sitting you'll be able to watch what you came to watch. If it's really busy, service gets pretty slow, so keep that in mind if you end up here during a big game. Overall, Blue 32 is a great place to come for good food and drinks while you're watching your favorite team."
0,"The doctor's have lots of credentials, but our doctor didn't have great bedside manner. Never once did our doctor try to get to know our daughter. We felt like we were just another paying customer, get in, get out.\n\nThere use to be a young lady that worked in the front office that was friendly, but she is no longer there. Other than her, the nurse assistant was always friendly and another lady that works in billing that is always smiling and friendly, but out of all of them that is it. They all appear to hate their job.\n\nWe took our daughter in because she was sick and they ran a strep test on her and told us that we would get our results in 2 days. They charged us at the end of the visit and said that they would call with the results. One week later and still nothing. We called and they said that they were going to figure out what happened with the results.\n\nNeedless to say, we will definitely not be going back."
1,"Definitely one of the more crowded spots we visited during the weekend, but they have the space to accommodate it!\n\nThere were different levels/rooms playing different types of music as well as an outdoor area.  We mostly stuck with the hip hop room - but it soon became uncomfortably crowded so we ended up chilling in the outside area by the end of the night.\n\nOverall good music with plenty going on so there was something for everyone."
0,"Noisy. Crowded. Mediocre food.\n\nI also call their cleanliness into question. Upon attempting to use a mustard bottle at our patio table, a piece of dirt/napkin/dried-out-mustard had jammed the tip of the squeeze bottle. What I thought was just thick mustard exploded all over myself and my wife when whatever was clogging the end was forcibly ejected from squeezing it.\n\n+1 star because the waiter was kind enough to bring towels wet with soda-water for us to clean ourselves up."
1,"I don't think there is a better dinner value anywhere in Charlotte than the Bento Box at the Cowfish. A yummy roll, a little burger slider, those great sweet potato fries, and my favorite - the cucumber salad! What more could you ask for???\n\nI also really liked the different 'flavors' of edamame and the seared sesame tuna appetizer is delicious!\n\nThe Cowfish is always reliably good. And on a nice evening, there's no better spot than the patio.  The Cowfish is also always reliably packed, so be prepared for a wait!"
0,"It is unfortunate that I must give the restaurant one star because our food was good and we had an awesome bartender.  The hostess was very friendly also. \n\nThe bad part...\n\nI had a restaurant.com gift certificate, Not a COUPON, to use specifically for this restaurant. I've had a lot of problems and misunderstandings with restaurant.com this week so I specifically asked them if I could use my certificate for alcohol and they told me that this is one of the few that you can because they did not specify otherwise. There was nothing that stated that it could not be used for alcohol like my other ones. This was basically a gift card.\n\nNumerous employees got involved in our situation. One guy said no, then a girl said yes, the a rude girl said no...then the manager got involved.\n\nTo make a long story short...the manager refused to let us use the certificate for drinks. She said that it is NC law that alcohol can't be discounted...not really sure what that means. Restaurants and bar run specials all the time...is that not discounting alcohol? Again, I had a certificate not a coupon so there  was no discount involved. It was just a lame excuse that she made up. I was so pissed....almost ruined our evening.\n\nOur bartender was terrific, he needs to find a more reputable restaurant to work for."
1,"I found this restaurant by looking at the list of top 25 restaurants in the Charlotte Magazine. We came in on a Fri afternoon, to a very busy restaurant. We were greeted and it took about 5-7 minutes to seat us. Considering the crowd, we ordered our drinks and food. The place looked clean. Menus were simple. (Mgt needs to hire another waitress.) The sweet tea was good. I ordered a Cuban pork sandwich with kettle chips. My wife ordered the salmon and mashed sweet potatoes. Food was tasty. Value too. Overall, a good (not great) experience. The blackberry and peach cobbler was really good!"
0,"I was in Las Vegas for a business convention and arrived at the hotel midday on Friday. Originally, I was given a room on the 15th floor, but when I tried to turn in for the night at around 11pm, I was awakened by a group of shrieking hyenas in heat. Startled by the notion that I had checked into the local zoo and not the Hilton, I went downstairs to the front desk. On my way down, I was shocked to discover that the mild, classy hotel I'd entered earlier that day had transformed into a meat auction, where both the goods and bidders were walking advertisements for Ed Hardy and the discount section of Forever 21. After a brief chat with Ray during which I explained my bewilderment and my necessity for sleep in order to conduct the back-to-back meetings I had planned for the next day, I was given a different room, far away from the cattle auction. While this made my trip bearable, the disappointments from this so-called Hilton did not end.\n\nOn Sunday, I went down to the taxi stand at 10am for a cab and found myself in a line ten people deep. I waited over 15 minutes for a taxi. I refuse to believe that mid-morning on a SUNDAY is Las Vegas' rush hour. Apparently, the valet service wanted to sell a party bus to the unsuspecting guests, and a slew of cabs suddenly appeared only AFTER the Hilton charged $10/person to a party of 7 to rent a limo. Thanks, dude with glasses for making us wait in the heat while you lined your pockets. Truly, a class act one would generally expect from an establishment as well known as the Hilton corporation.\n\nIf you're a 20-something with poor fashion taste and questionable judgment in the opposite sex looking for a regrettable one night stand, this is the hotel for you. Otherwise, spend your hard earned money and precious vacation time somewhere else."
1,"Came here looking for a decent breakfast in Vegas, and was not disappointed.  \n\nI had the chicken fried steak and eggs, with bacon pancakes.\n\nThe CFS had a good texture.  The gravy was good.  The eggs were a little underdone for \""Over Medium\"", but that's up to interpretation.  But enough of this.  This is a pancake joint, so let's talk about those.  The bacon pancakes were very good.  They had bacon in them, and on them.  They were springy and resilient without being tough.  Not too soft or hard, but just about perfect.  They were flavorful, and very tasty.  \n\nThe service was good.  The waitress pleasant.  Everything was pretty quick.  The cost was decent.  Were I a local, I'd probably come here often.\n\nAbout the only thing that I can ding them on, and the reason this isn't a five star review, is that the coffee is not great.  It's on par with the other places I've been in Vegas, but not great.  I'm a coffee snob, and can't handle what tastes like something that came pre-ground in pre-measured bags."
0,"We came here on a Friday night for dinner. Although my expectations were high from reading all of the good reviews, ESRG's underwhelming quality wasn't even close to what I would expect of a 4+ star establishment. It was a disappointing experience.\n\nThe overall design and ambiance of the restaurant is nice. Clean and modern feeling. The service is satisfactorily friendly.\n\nFor dinner we ordered an oyakodon bowl and a robata and sushi combination. The miso soup was okay, but had no seaweed in it. Not awful, but miso soup should have seaweed in it. Next came a spinach salad with a touch of vinaigrette on it. Extremely boring and not tasty.\n\nThe oyakodon bowl was okay. The skewers of grilled chicken and fish I received with my combo dinner were drier than beef jerky. The nigiri slices were cut too thick. Although I appreciate the generosity, it's not fun to chew on a slice of salmon that's too thick.\n\nA fairly unremarkable sushi restaurant. There are many far better sushi establishments with slightly more reasonable prices."
1,"This place is a gem. The Butter Bars are the best ever, not too rich so it makes your stomach ill, but perfect taste and 10 miles after i left wished i would have gotten more. Chocolate filled was best ever too."
1,"Great dance music, but you have to be able to handle a crowd!!"
0,"I am a thirty eight years old. I just moved here from Nevada and am using my passport as temporary ID. I did not assume I would need it to buy sex toys. I was refused for having an obviously legitimate but expired ID. At 38 years old. Fuck this place with a hammer. It is genuinely creepy, requiring an intercom entrance, has threatening signs posted in the parking lot and generally feels like it is the first stop for newly released ex cons. No thanks.\n\nAnd why are all sex shops now sorry excuses for aspiring potheads? Can I now load up on bath salts and have a psychotic break while simultaneously working out the kinks in my new 50 Shades of Grey faux S&M discovery set? I could.\n\nOr...\n\nI can just go to A Woman's Touch and not feel like I need a Silkwood shower upon exiting."
1,"Came here on a recent trip to Las Vegas based on a recommendation. I thought it was a bit pricey especially since the fries are almost $4 for a small portion. \n\nThe cheesteak was pretty good. but I don't have much to compare it to being that I am an LA native, and I have never been to Philly :( \n\nMy bf did have to add a little salt to the steak meat, he said it needed more seasoning *shrugs*\n\nWould I return to Pops when I visit Vegas again? Yes, I would. I want to try the green bean fries."
1,"Liz is amazing! Such a wonderful person and business owner! The way she treats her clients is unheard of now a days. I highly recommended that if anyone is looking for a great groomer, puff and fluff will treat your beloved pet like royalty."
1,"This is a fun treat shop to go to. Everything is sweetened with maple syrup! It give the gelato a unique taste that reminds me of a sweet pancake breakfast. They also sell other maple syrup \""enhanced\"" products like body lotion and liquid soap. Those didn't appeal to me as much. Go in for the treats and you will be satisfied. It's a bit touristy but it's still a genuine store with a seemingly unique flavor!"
0,"I have no idea how this place got 4.5 stars. Their food is possibly some of the worst food I have ever had. Ever. And that's pretty bad, as I'm not super picky. I've been to two of their locations and both times I was completely unimpressed.\n\nFirst time I had a burger. I requested it rare, and of course it came out well done. Like damned rubber. Anyone knows that once you go rare, you don't dare...go...well done. Ok I was trying to be funny and I failed, but you get my point. And the food came in some crazy picnic-type containers. Shit you'd see if you bought it at the Fair or your neighbor's BBQ.\n\nSecond time was a salad. Trying to be healthy!!@#! The \""greens\"" were pretty much ALL iceberg lettuce. REALLY you guys? REALLY? Too expensive for such a lousy salad. If I wanted to munch on what was basically water I would've ordered a free water! The one I created myself at Old Country Buffet tasted far far better. \n\nThe only thing it has going for it is decent drink selections/prices and a nice bar-like atmosphere. But tons of other bars have that too AND good food to boot. Like Santisi Brothers. Yeah, count this place out.\n\nOh, their logo is kinda nice. Makes me think the buffalo just drank Red Bull though."
1,"After an evening of nonstop Vegas-style partying, the only words I managed to utter from my dry raspy voice the following morning was...water please!!!\n\nIn addition to replenishing my body with much needed liquids, I was feeling mighty peckish, as well!  After much deliberation, our group decided on a calm & relaxing sit down Saturday brunch at Thomas Keller's Bouchon. \n\nLocated on the 10th floor inside the Venetian, the restaurant embodied what I've come to expect from a fine French bistro. The vibe was chic & refined yet relaxed and unfussy.  There were comfortable banquettes throughout the main dining area as well as outdoor seating in the patio area. We were subsequently seated inside. At 12:00pm, the sun was beaming from the patio, so our location filtered the intense light perfectly, which suited me and my solar sensitive eyes just fine. \n\nComplimentary house made jam was magnificent! The jam is freshly prepared each day and depending on the chef's mood, a different flavor variety is served. Today, he was feeling strawberry, which is my personal favorite! They served us an Epi baguette to share and it was fantastic, as well. Warm, buttery crust with perfectly chewy texture. Coupled with the soft butter and sweet pucker inducing jam, it was a match made in the stars.\n\nThe entrees were orchestrated perfectly as we didn't have to wait long at all.\n\nChicken n waffles - The waffles were made with bacon n chives and sourdough batter. It was airy and crisp with a lightly sweet flavor and a savory finish. It was so good i almost forgot to use the syrup!\nThe chicken was roasted perfectly and it was insanely moist & tender! The chasseur wine sauce was rich and flavorful with an alluring aroma. Some of my guests enjoyed the savory flavor so much they poured the irresistible sauce over their waffles, too!\n\nPork belly was fatty and incredibly flavorful and juicy.  Accompanied by the creamy hollandaise sauce, it was absolutely delicious!\n\nCorned beef hash was phenomenal! Well seasoned pieces of corned beef mixed with all the traditional fixins that will impress any die hard corned beef hash purist!  Trust, this was far from canned! \n\nShort rib was tender, the fontina cheese was fragrant and the whimsically tiny jingle bell peppers added a pleasant little kick to this fantastic dish!\n\nBeignets were served fresh out of the oven but they were quite dense and tasted more like doughnuts IMO Overall, they were very moist and with the added raspberry preserve filling, they added a sweet finish to our savory entrees.\n\nOur service throughout the meal was very consistent with coffees, water, and juices always filled to the brim.\n\nBy the end of the meal we were absolutely stuffed!  But I didn't mind at all :D\n\nMy friends and I had a wonderful time and it was great feeling totally replenished and revived with good quality food that was masterfully prepared with fantastic service to boot. The strong coffee didn't hurt either!  I'm not quite sure if this particular location was ever awarded a Michelin star but IMO Thomas Keller deserves praise for a dining experience that was unpretentious, comforting and very enjoyable!\n\nWhen we all left, I was sated, 100% refreshed and ready to take on the world, well at least another round of partying :) \n\nHey, it's Vegas for crying out loud.\n\nHappy Eats!"
0,"I've tried all the Pin Kaow locations and they're not the same as the original on Rainbow and Lake Mead. Back about 18 yrs ago there wasn't much asian food options in Vegas. You may find a few tucked inside strip malls or by grocery stores.\n\nWell this one was in a strip type plaza, very small maybe sat 20 or so people but it was the best Thai food in that side of town (Summerlin area? it wasn't called anything then. )"
0,"Ok, this place was really weird. I wanted to like it, but it's very expensive and kind of confusing.\n\nWe got there about 10 minutes before the last call for breakfast orders. Our waitress confirmed we'd still be able to order breakfast. She handed us like four menus, explained nearly every item on each one, and almost all of them had a catch (something missing, etc). Then we got a second waitress who took at least 15 minutes to get to us. We were not allowed to order breakfast.\n\nThe food wasn't bad by any means, but it wasn't anything special."
0,"Went last nite.  VERY noisy, not a romantic date nite place for sure.  Fun loud atmosphere, lots of spankings, lots of alcohol.  The food, just so-so.\nProbably an ok place for a drunken party with friends, not the place for a nice meal."
1,"Where I come from, while having a shabu shabu you might as well drop your wallet into the pot so expensive is the experience.\n\nHanashima hits the spot on all fronts. \n\nFirstly, it is a very informal setting and elegantly minimalistic. High stools, a long counter and an individual burner for each guest are really all it takes for shabu shabu, no bells and whistles added.\n\nSecondly, it is incredibly well-priced and they make a perceptible effort to keep their prices down. In the two and more years I've been a patron, the prices haven't changed by a digit.\n\nRecession bit them too, so today instead of ice cream PLUS iced coffee for dessert, you get one or the other. Additionally, if before prices included tax, today the tax is extra. It is still a bargain.\n\nThirdly, the service is efficient, polite, cheerful and fast. I would go to Hanashima just to have the waitress smile at me.\n\nFourthly, the menu is simple but the meal is filling and involves a variety of courses. The extra sides you can order make the customisations almost endless.\n\nEven ethnic food sceptics appreciate the straightforwardness of Hanashima's approach and the sheer quality of their food. I've seen it happen first-hand.\n\nOther reviewers mentioned another website that lists Hanashima (restomontreal). After reading the reviews on Yelp, heading over there for the vouchers can actually offset the sales taxes (10%). (I hope this doesn't breach Yelp's terms).\n\nHanashima is a spot to keep in your books due to its perfection and its location. In the heart of Chinatown, it is close to great Chinese bakeries where you can get an extra dessert and bubble tea.\n\nI also recommend Hanashima for a cheap and no-strings-attached date, or for post-important-introductions dinners. The counter seating doesn't require guests to stare at each other for the meal's duration, the crowd, decor and food provide great converation starters and the gentle broth's bubbling fills in the necessary moments of silence.\n\nA relaxed meal in an unusual setting without the pressure of it being too unusual. Vegetarians are catered for with the huge veggie combo, meat-eaters are spoilt for choice, seafood lovers will delight in the seafood combo and everyone will have a great time at an excellent price.\n\nGet the regular portions, splurge because here you can!\n\nReserve whenever you go: I saw it fill up pretty fast on both weekday (sometimes) and weekend nights (always)."

0,"I ordered a happy meal from the drive thru for my son and there was a large cockroach dead in the box.  I went into the store and was told that I must have put the roach in the box, that they did not believe that they served me a meal with a roach in the box.  I've filed a formal complaint with the health department, and also with McD's corporate.  If there's ever a reason to stop eating fast food, this was my reason..."
1,"He said... I'll take u to wherever u want to go.. You pick... I said Cibo!!!!!!\n\n\nI had very high expectations for this place because everyone is always talking about it and telling me how amazing it is. I finially got a chance to try it out for the first time this past weekend.  \n\nSo we ordered the prosciutto pizza.. I wasn't that impressed as I would hope to be. I felt like there should've been more on there. Maybe some basil, veggies, mushrooms? Something? It was just a pizza topped with some prosciutto.  I also got my favorite type of red wine. Pinot noir. Delicious. I definitely love their wine here. \n\nIt really is a perfect spot for a date. Super romantic. Disappointed about the pizza we got but I'll definitely come back to try the others. =)"
1,Great decor and experience at the bouchon each time I've been here .... \n\nGreat for brunch which is why most people go here but also great for dinner \n\nCroque madame is amazing for brunch \n\nFor dinner.... \n- sea bass was good except the sauce was slight on the salter side \n-the chicken was super tender and the sauce complimented well\n-the lamb was pretty good and amazing ! Texture was just perfect \n-foie Gras in a jar was good it was tasty and paired well with the slight salt .... but I actually really liked it with jam it off setted some of the saltiness\n\nAwesome service !\nAaron Pana manager and our server Danny surprised our bride to be with a a box of macaroons .... she really wanted them so the manager walked over to the bakery and got some macaroons it was amazing with our coffee
0,"Waaaaaaaaay overrated. Here's the breakdown; half decent fries, very greasy burgers, sausages in a hot dog bun, and a handful of fatty mayo based dipping sauces. None of this is exceptional. And you WILL leave this poorly ventilated restaurant smelling like grease. that alone is enough to stay away."
0,I called and didn't even bother leaving a message after reading the reviews. If you advertise that you are open then you may want to consider answering your phone. You just lost another customer.
0,"This cvs pharmacy must be a top contender for THE SLOWEST pharmacy in the world. I have spent more time waiting in line to drop off and pick up prescriptions here than I have actually being at doctors' offices. Just today, with a car full of small children, I waited 40 minutes in the drive through (with only 2 cars ahead of me) trying to pick up a prescription. When you actually pull up to the window, you can see the staff laughing and joking with each other as they tell you to \""hold on just a minute!\"" And continue to talk to each other. Interacting with customers though is serious business. No more laughing or smiling, just serious give-me-your-info-NOW and let's-hurry-this-up-so-I-can-get-back-to-my-friends tones in their voices. \nBut seriously. They are ridiculously SLOW! Usually (at other pharmacies) you can get a prescription filled while you wait. Unless you are shopping in CVS for a couple hours, don't count on that here. I'm pretty sure they have a minimum of 2 hours to wait. I've never been told it will be done sooner than that. I have been told I may want to come back the next day....\nI wish there was another pharmacy that accepted my insurance closer to where I live. I would never set foot in or near this one again."
0,I am a 34 year old man who went in with my wife a few days after I renewed my license I wanted to try one of there new mixed drinks but when I was carded me a 34 year old 6 ft 300 lb man was carded and toled because me license was expiered  that the would not serve me. The 34 year old man so we left and I never plan to go back.
1,"Probably the best pizza I have ever eaten, and this is my opinion and i have been to mang pizza and wings places. From my freshman year at la joya till now, i have been coming to this place for the past 7 years and i still plan on coming.\n\nTheir Hawaiian with medium wings and their ranch is by far the best!"
1,"By far one of my favorite BBQ joints in AZ! I love me some BBQ but am also all about the sides. If I go to a BBQ place that has terrible sides, no matter how good the meat is, I most likely will not return. The meat and sides both need to be phenomenal for me to be satisfied! Famous Dave's gets it right with both! Ive gotten several meats from here (I go here a lot) and all have been great. These include the Georgia Chopped Pork, the brisket, the country roasted chicken (I think this is actually my favorite), and I definitely cannot forget about the sweet water catfish with remoulade and sweet chili sauce (Comes in second). Ive also tried a number of the sides and they are all awesome: mac and cheese is by far my favorite cause its creamy and has sweet corn and jalapenos in it. So different but some of the best mac I have ever had! Their potato salad also rocks. Its not sweet potato salad but its flavor is out of this world! Also great are the Wilbur beans and the firecracker green beans with bacon! YES BACON!. About the only side I am not fond of is their fries. I find these little steak fries to be mediocre at best. Additionally, most of the meals are served with a corn muffin which is sooooo good. Make sure you ask for honey with this. So yeah, this place makes me pretty happy each time I go here. One of the best things about it is the price. You can get a 2 meat combo with two sides, corn muffin, and corn on the cob for 13.99! That's AWESOME! Now on to a couple of things that could be better. They are not always consistent with their meat. The hub has stated that their Brisket is very inconsistent and sometimes is out of this world and other times a little dry. Same with the chopped pork. Also, sometimes the service is extremely slow and not very friendly. Lastly, the desserts could be better. Being a total bread pudding connoisseur, I order it wherever I go that they have it if I have room. Got it here once and was not impressed. It tasted more like cake and the maple sauce on it just wasn't my thing. If you want great bread pudding, hit up Charlestons. Also, I think Famous Daves uses the same cake in all their non chocolate desserts. Last night when I ordered the mini strawberry shortcake, it looked the same as the bread pudding but with a strawberry sauce instead of the maple sauce. Bread pudding is not cake so it should not be made with cake! Also, strawberry shortcake should have several strawberries in it rather then just a little slice with a thin runny strawberry sauce. But to each his own, this is just my opinion and some people might love their desserts. I will admit that their chocolate brownie sundae is pretty dam tasty. Anyways, if you are looking for great BBQ and sides at a great price, this is your place!"
1,"I was surprised that I haven't written a review for the Yard House...weird. \n\nWell to sum it up, this latest visit to the Yard House was for a close friends Birthday Dinner. I was only expecting five people or so, but she reserved almost 20 some-odd seats!!! So good to know that the Yard House does take reservations in advance for such a huge party.  The party didn't start off as planned since the birthday girl was nearly two hours late for her own party!! lol. However, thank goodness for the large LCD TV screens plastered on every inch and corner of this place, we were able to kill the time, starting with some drinks and enjoying Sunday Night Football at the same time...so it all didn't go to waste :) The beer selection is AMAZING! They dedicate a whole two pages of the menu just for the beer, I've also seen Beer Floats and I have yet to try one. If you don't want to spend full price on alcoholic beverages, they have Happy Hour from 10pm-Close. \n\nThe Yard House...its an interesting restaurant. The ambiance in this place is...well....AMAZING!? ha ha. It's weird, you sit there at your table and the lighting is dim and serene, yet at the same time, with the LCD Screens and the bar smacked right in the middle of the restaurant, it's also like a pub! So...like a high class restaurant/Pub/Sports bar/Lounge? Does this make any sense? Because I'm just typing away and totally going off subject..........\n\nFood! I usually start off with the Calamari, the baby-squid type, not that O-ring type! Yum Yum....and my main dish is always the Crab Crusted Swordfish on Wasabi Mashed Potatoes. Absolutely amazing! The swordfish is cooked just right, every time I have ordered this dish, and not once was the fish over cooked. Its pretty pricey, $23.00 (give or take), but the portion is well worth your money! :) However this time I decided to try something else and a bit lighter. Since i filled my body with a lot of alcohol for the night, something big would get me sick so I decided to order something small. So I figured an appetizer, that's small enough right? I ordered the Ahi Poke Stacker which was $11.95. Ahi Poke is cubed raw tuna tossed in a mix of soy sauce, sesame seed oil, onions, limu, green onions. I grew up on this stuff, so I was quite curious of the Yard House's recipe. I was VERY satisfied. When I received my plate, first layer was ahi poke, then a layer of \""fried something\"", next topped with seasoned sauteed Carrots, another layer of  the fried \""crispy something\"", topped with more poke. It was light, refreshing, and absolutely delish!!! The taste was just as amazing as its presentation. :) My new favorite dish! Don't forget to finish off with the Kona Coffee Sundae for dessert, it's quite big, so you can share with a friend or significant other! \n\nUsually with big groups, taking orders could be tricky. It makes sense for a group of 14, to assign two waiters to take orders. After that experience, unless the two waiters can communicate good, its not a good idea. Problems such as taking double orders (esp with drinks..) not cool! But it was all squared away with no problems. Other than that the waiters were on their game and totally cool!"
0,"Having met the man twice and finding him quite the entertaining character, I decided to try the restaurant inspired by him. Oscar Goodman. The (formerly) happiest mayor on earth. And former mob defense attorney. He and his image are quintessential Vegas. I had to try his steakhouse. \n\nEntering with a coworker at 8 pm on a Monday night, we were seated right away. Service can only be described as short and surly. From the hostess to the two servers we encountered, I consistently got the strong impression they were looking at their watches in anticipation of closing time. A stark contrast to, say, Vic & Anthony's Steakhouse over at Golden Nugget (see separate review). \n\nThe menu is mob-inspired, consisting of names of gangsters you'll recognize. I went with the Spilatro's Steak with garlic mashed potatoes. It may not look like much from the attached photo, bit it was actually quite good. \n\nThe restaurant is adorned with photos of Oscar and his career. I think the theme works fine here, and the location is great. It's in the area formerly occupied by Firefly, directly at the West end of Fremont Street. The dining area over looks the Fremont Street Experience. It's an excellent view. \n\nAll in all, the food was good. The theme was fun. But the service not so much. I'm always deeply disappointed when a place gets so much right and then just drops it all at customer service. How do other places like Vic's get it right consistently and places like this don't? I think it starts at the top. Carefully screening the right personalities to hire and then training and evaluating them. Consistently. \n\nOscar's needs to make an attempt, here. And until they do, the servers will bring down the house. This may be why there was so much open seating at 8 pm during Spring Break week. \n\nI sincerely hope they do bring it around because I'd like to see this place survive. If enough people point this out to them, maybe they will."
1,"The boyfriend and I were looking for a good pho spot around the area that was delicious yet reasonable in price. We've been to Viet Bistro since it's closer to home but for their quality, the price didn't match at all. I checked out this place on Yelp and saw really good reviews so I thought this would be our second place to try. \n\nAs everyone knows it's been deathly chilly outside so we wanted some nice hot soup to warm us up! \nAs soon as we walked in we were warmly greeted by a woman, and she told us where to sit. She offered us hot tea in which we gladly accepted and gave us our menus. \nThere were a few people in the restaurant, wasn't too packed.\nAfter a couple minutes a friendly man came and took our orders.\nI ordered the #1 pho combo which was like $7, the bf ordered #3 which was like $6, and also we ordered some spring rolls which were $3. \nOur orders came out quick and I noticed that the spring rolls were freshly made! It was delicious, and the peanut sauce was good as well. Not as thick as the usual sauce I've eaten before but good enough. \nThe pho bowls were huge  My boyfriend who ordered the #3 was quite surprised at how big his bowl was considering its price. \nThe soup was delicious and warmed me up, the meat was scrumptious and the noodles were perfect. Not one strand was soggy! \n\nThe man who took our orders was great, he was very friendly, always checking up on us and other customers asking how we were doing.\nThe restaurant itself was nice and clean, cozy and had a homey feeling."
0,"My friend told me that this place was ok. I wanted to try it out for myself. The food was not great at all. It was all very bland tasting, the pho, Thai dishes, all of it. We wanted to try the papaya salad, but the lady who makes it was not there that day. I don't think I would come back and I would not recommend it to others. I only gave it two stars because the service was really good. I guess when you go to an Asian restaurant and there are no Asian people eating there, that should've been another clue to go somewhere else. The only pros I can think of are the cute name, cleanliness, and good service."
1,"My boyfriend, a friend and myself checked out Kabuki's happy hour on a Friday afternoon. It was surprisingly... dead. I think there was one other table. It got a little bit more busy later but still surprisingly slow for a Friday, I thought.\n\nTheir saketinis are sooo yummy. First, I got the creamy peach and that was very tasty.. sweet but not too strong. My second drink was the Fuji Apple saketini and that was.. kind of strong and it didn't taste like Fuji apples.. my friend said they put apple puckers in there.. that was all I could taste pretty much. I tried my friend's mango chu-hi (a sochu drink) and it was good.. kind of weak, but she said there is mango puree in there. yum!\n\nFor appetizers:\n-Spicy Tuna Salad ($4.95 HH) Spicy tuna on top of spring lettuce, shredded cucumber and radish sprouts. Good stuff, but I just don't like the ground up spicy tuna.. I like them in chunks!\n-Sesame Chicken ($4.95 HH) \n-Salmon nigiri ($2.50 HH) \n-Vegad Roll ($5.95 HH)\n-Agedashi Tofu ($3.95 HH) \n\nThey still have reverse happy hour, I think starting at 9pm. It used to buy select items and regular price and get the second item (in the same category) for a $1 but I think they did away with this. \n\nOverall, their food and happy hour is good. I'd say regular price, they are kind of high. But that could be due to being located in a popular shopping center.. but who knows. Will be back :)"
0,"We stayed here this weekend. When we booked we let them know we had children. They assured us the pools would be perfect for them. Well, that could not be a bigger lie of they tried. The pool was so over packed with drunk people that the lazy river doesn't even move. One man even pushed my 8 year old under the most intense waterfall I have ever felt. Luckily my 25 year old saw her in time and pulled her out from being trapped in the current. When I told management, they said there was nothing they could do, that they have a routy crowd because of the concerts they host... So why did you originally tell me this is the perfect place for kids? Also, why does a child drowning not alert the sleeping lifeguard? Oh, and why is their response to my child drowning, \""I can comp you a couple drinks at the pool tomorrow?\"" Are you kidding? Why would I go back to pool where my child almost died? You should also know the Signature's team claims there are not a part of the MGM even though they are called The Signature at the MGM Grand. What a joke. Don't got here. Way over priced and not safe at all. \n\nAnother thing- you're only allowed to park 1 car at the hotel. They tell you if you have 2 to go park the other one at the MGM even though they claim not to be connect."
1,"We went here for a toddler-level 'hike' this weekend and I can't believe that in all my life of living in the Valley I haven't stopped here to enjoy this park.  I'm almost embarrassed to admit that!  In my defense, I have hiked up to Governor Hunt's white pyramid tomb that overlooks the Phoenix Zoo, which I *think* is still technically park of Papago Park...no?  But this time I was on the side of the park with the buttes and I've definitely never been on this side of the park before.\n\nIt was very pleasant and the brisk weather was great for outdoor exercise, and ensuring no snakes.  That no snakes thing is a BIG plus in my book.  \n\nThe paved trails all seemed well maintained and stroller friendly.  The unpaved trails were even perfect for my large wheeled, jogging stroller, but no bueno for some tiny wheeled, umbrella stroller.  The sole picnic ramada area I saw at the base of the buttes was very large and well kept too.  \n\nI liked how clean the park was and how you can experience a very basic outdoor hike while still being in the city with a full cell signal.  In fact I saw someone rappelling down the side of the one of the buttes and numerous people enjoying the cool weather on the bikes; it's nice that people can do that right in the center of the Valley. All in all, it made it the perfect place to take my baby daughter for her first little 'hike' so she could wander around and pick up rocks and see the view of Phoenix, but if needed we were a mere 20 minutes from home.  \n\nThe only complaint was that I didn't see any public restrooms at the entrance to the trail by the parking lot, just a water fountain.  By the time we were leaving all that water I drank back there on the trail had gone right though me, and I would have even welcomed a smelly porta-potty.\n\n\nOh, and I saw that some oatmeal brain had carefully bagged their dog's crap and then left the little bag of dog crap laying on the ground by the trailhead.  This was the ONLY litter I saw, by the way.   This begs the question of the person that left it, why even bag your dog's crap if you aren't then gonna throw it away in the trashcan a staggering 50 feet away??  Are you attempting to preserve the poop from disintegrating and decomposing in the natural elements by leaving it in that little baggie for all of posterity?    Or perhaps you have a butler that follows you around and picks up the little baggies of poop that you leave everywhere?  \n\nTHAT must be it.  You are a lucky person to have such a clean up service...  Idiot."
1,"I am a fan of True Foods and wish we had more Sam Fox restaurants in Houston. I had the kale, sweet potato salad and am now trying to replicate the recipe on my own because it was delicious! The patio was nice and the decor is great here."
1,"I met Susan a few years ago when I was drawn into her space at a yoga festival and I bought some beautiful clothes. \nEverything I bought is still in heavy rotation, I often get complimented on her designs. \nShe's always is always available if you want to follow up."
0,"Their chips and fries are good.  We could've had more to choose from if the menus were all in the same spot.  One is by the door, the other is behind the counter.  Where one would figure a menu should be.  It was our first time there so we ordered.  Then saw a hotdog,...asked the girl at the counter where it was on the menu, and she said it was behind us.  Hmmm... of course the menu would be behind us.\n\nAlso, when we were there, there was no ice.  I asked the girl if there it just needed to be refilled, but she said just to wait until it makes more ice.  What the heck???\n\nCashiers could be a little friendlier."
0,"Based solely on the previous reviewers good experience with this landscaper, I decided to give him a call. He was very nice on the phone, however he never showed up at my house to take care of my yard. No phone call, nothing. Either his business is so incredibly booming right now, or his phone and vehicle were swallowed up in a space-time vortex. Regardless, he successfully lived up to my expectations regarding landscapers."
0,"We were handed menus and after ordering, then the waiter informed my friend that the item she ordered would take over an hour to cook because we went there for lunch but that item was a dinner item. Shouldn't there be separate menus? Or at least indicate on the menu that the item is a dinner item. \n\nWaitress got her face too close to my face for my personal comfort. \n\nFood was good but had too much butter and salt -- couldn't even finish my asparagus because it was swimming in butter or oil... Way to make a vegetable unhealthy! Lol \n\nOn the plus side, the salmon was tasty and moist. The gluten free bread was satisfying and crispy. \n\nAll in all, okay food but plenty of room for improvement in both preparation and service."
1,"Opium was one of the regular nightclubs I visited when I first moved to Edinburgh and I was still young and impressionable. For some reason I have fond memories.\n\nLet me get a few things straight. I don't regard Opium as some dark or brooding bar where bad ass punks go to rock out. No its a place where teenagers and students would like to be, rock out. I should also say that this place always seemed to smell a bit to me. I know that's not that unusual for a late night drinking spot, and others disagree but I thought I should point it out.\n\nAnyway the key to Opium is to not take it too seriously. The bar downstairs plays an impressive range of rock, increasingly more classic rock and pop rock \""emo\"" stuff, the latter of which you will just have to put up with. Upstairs is the small dance floor where you can boogie on down (shake your head a lot). This place is definitely best enjoyed with a large group of friends who can laugh past some of the \""dark\"" facade and get some classics on the juke box going.\n\nThere are cheap drink deals throughout the week. It can get quite busy on a Friday and Saturday night, considerably less so on week nights."
1,Good quality food. Free WiFi. HiTech iPads for placing orders. Will e-mail or text receipts. A little pricy for a fast food bistro.
1,"The best place to support when you need to get quality food, toys, or accessories for your pets!  The store owner is always knowledgeable and always have treats for your dog if you bring them in.  She is always willing to help me find just what I need and usually has samples of different types of foods.  Prices here are great and it's a very nice addition to the Lakeside neighborhood."
0,"Came here for a birthday dinner and found it average. Nice decor and fun seating and bathrooms. But for the price I just wasn't blown away. It kind of annoyed me that our server when asked about something kept saying, \""It's so great, it's my favorite!\"" Really? The whole menu is your favorite? Every wine on the wine list is your favorite? My father order a ribeye that looked like a NY strip and said something to the waiter.  He argued with him for like ten minutes.  My father worked as a butcher for many years.  Trust me if he said it wasn't a ribeye, it wasnt.  I wont be back."
0,"Called Caesars palace, and they referred us over to the quad. Payed 350 a night in a room that had no windows, and looked like it was stuck in the 80's. Greatly disappointed with what was promised at least decent room turned out to be something worse than a hotel 6. Nice it was on they strip, the only positive experience out of this trip."
0,"The Peppermill defies description.  Refined tackiness.  Utterly Craptastic.  Could it be that a Flamingo exploded in this place to give it the outragious pink hues?\n\nAll kidding aside, the best thing about this restaurant is the decor.  It screams cheesiness and vintage Vegas, with its faux neon lights and the veritable faux forest.  When was the last time you saw a deciduous tree in the middle of the desert?  I love the decor, and make sure that I always step into the lounge, open 24 hours a day, to see the fire and water fountain as well as the cocktail servers in the evening gowns split up to...here.\n\nNow to the substance.  Peppermill is an institution.  It has been around seeming forever, and had a scene from \""Casino\"" filmed there with Sharon Stone.\n\nThe food is average, at best.  It is also overpriced.  The place is best on its breakfast foods, in my humble opinion.  The omelets are huge, but again, overpriced.\n\nThe appetizer sampler platter is good, but overpriced.  Oddly enough, the onion rings on the appetizer platter are different than the onion rings as a side item.\n\nI recommend this place for drinks in the lounge, and for breakfast on the weekends if you are staying on the Strip.  The place, while overpriced, is still cheaper than the buffet.  And more fun.\n\nAre you noticing a trend here?  I will hit you over the head with it one more time...overpriced."
1,"This place is pretty cool on the inside but the food is awesome. I had a cheese burger and I couldn't even finish it, that surprised me"
0,"I got there 15 mins after they opened and they were already really busy. The woman that did my pedicure did it in less time than anyone around me and I had to go home and fix it. I asked her for a two color french and she said that she couldn't do it it was \""too hard\"". She did the worst job ever.There is ONE really great person there VICKI and I will only go back there if she is available. SOOOOO disappointed."
1,I really enjoy the games. It is a good family outing. We went on a might when they had fireworks which were set to good music and were fantastic!  We have been going to games for quite a few years and they have improved the food somewhat.  I got a Chicago dog from one stand that had some gourmet dogs. We also tried some loaded nachos that were not bad. Love the hecklers on Thursday dollar beer night!
1,"We thought it was great. Went on nat'l tequila day and it was super busy. But everything we had (margaritas, 2 tequila flights, shared fajitas for two) was excellent. Atmosphere was wonderful. Looking forward to going again."
0,"Took a chance on this place because Pho 87 was closed.  Bad idea.  A bowl of Pho here costs $8.  Ok this is Vegas and this place is open 24 hours.  Someone is going to have to pay for the overhead costs of keeping this place open around the clock.\n\nService was fast to take our order and bring the menus/water.  Then things went downhill from there.\n\nI ordered #1 (egg rolls) and they were burnt on the sides.  Ok, I am so hungry, I will eat anything at this point.  One bite and ewwwww.  Why it is sour?  Other people took a bite.  Sour?\n\nTurns out the meat in the egg rolls was spoiled and they still served it!  I can't believe a place that is open 24 hours would pull this stunt.  We are not drunk!  No one in our party drinks.  We can tell what good Vietnamese food is suppose to taste like.  But if the customer can't taste it, why waste it?\n\nThe Pho is mediocre at best.  Nothing to brag about.  Do yourself a favor, just keep driving, just keep driving,  Keep driving.\n\nThen they tried to use a BS excuse and claim the egg rolls was not at it's best but still edible.  Not at it's best?  IT'S FRICKEN SOUR and you CAN KILL SOMEONE!\n\nThe only plus was that my bro was constipated from eating too much at the buffet.  Not anymore!  Plop, Plop, Fizz, Fizz, oh what a relief it is.\n\nYou pay at the end and it's only CASH only!"
1,"Yep, visited only a couple of days later for lunch with co-workers.   We all had to be there before it opened at 11:30 or else we'd never have enough to eat.  There was a line before it opened and there were always at least a few people who had to wait either at the entrance way or outside at all times.  Also important, your whole party has to be there or you won't be seated.\n\nAnd yes, yet again the tonkotsu impressed.  I love it!  And this time I ordered the extra chashu.  That meat in that delicious broth is just perfect.  Maybe one day I'll be compelled enough to order at refill for less than two bucks, but trust me when I say that one bowl is perfect and hits me in the right spot.  This might become a regular stop for lunch, of course provided I get there early enough."
1,"Read a review about the place and decided that we had to try it. Since we were going to the M resort, we figured it would be a good time to try. It was the best decision we ever made. Even though it is a ways from the strip, it was well worth the trip. The prices were amazing for the quality of the food. \n\nNever would have imaged from the outside of the place, what we found on the inside. We were extremely surprise. Nice size bar with a large variety of wines along with a number of different beers. \n\nAs far as the food, I order the lobster ravioli and my boyfriend order the chicken saltimbocca both were full favored. Amazed at the quality of the food. After trying these two items, we are definitely planning to come back to this location to try more of the menu. This place could easily be placed inside one of the high end casino/resorts on the strip. The food was that great. We had eaten at a number of the high end restaurants on the strip and feel that this particular place could not only compete with them but would surpass a number of them. \n\nAt the end of the meal, our waiter brought us a complementary slice of the their in-house made cheesecake which was over the top delicious. We were stuffed after the dinner but the cheesecake was to great to not eat the whole piece served. The cheesecake was served with strawberries in a strawberry sauce and some chocolate sauce on the other side of the slice which complemented it very well. \n\nWe most also give extreme remarks to our waiter, Chris who made us feel welcomed and did a wonderful job of serving us. He took extra steps in making sure, we were well taking care of during the whole meal from the time we entered the place until we finished. We could not ask for anything more."
1,super big store which i love! Employees are so nice and always ask if you need a bra measured or need help! dressing rooms are big. semi annul sale is awesome here. is farther from my house but thats not too big of a deal since i dont just go to scottsdale fashion square just for this store! is pricey thought which is sad because if it were somewhat cheaper i would shop here a lot more often!
1,"We've been taking our Shih Tzu to Tails A Waggin for over two years.  We had tried a couple of other groomers in Henderson before and just weren't very satisfied.  At one place I came back to pick up our pooch and he was in a cage on a shelf barking like crazy, probably because he doesn't like heights.  Both places just didn't seem to really care about the job they had done or about our pet.  \n\nWe have nothing but good to say about how our pet is treated and groomed at Tails A Waggin.  They do have a few small dogs who are loose in the shop but our Shih Tzu loves that.  Usually, our pet is put into a separate small cage on the floor that still allows a little interaction between the other dogs.  We've never seen any issues between dogs in the many times we have gone to Tails A Waggin.\n\nJim or Cindy always confirm how we want our dog groomed when we drop him off.  It usually takes just a couple of hours before we get a phone call that they are finished grooming him.  Our dog loves going there and he looks so cute with the colorful handkerchief they put on him afterwards."
1,"Great location to get to, good service and very prompt with the food.\n\nLove the smash fries, bbq bacon burger with fried egg is delish. Try the oreo shake which is always a winner. The truffle mushroom burger is also a great choice. This is above the in n out burgers and is as good as the expensive gourmet burgers at half the price.\n\nPlace is very clean and friendly."
0,We valet parked our car at Caesars to see Rod Stewart in concert.  The valet stole my Giants baseball cap that I happened to toss into the backseat.  I figured the hat was black and the car seats were black - you could barely see it.  But nope!  GONE!  You'd think they would hire a higher class of personnel.  Glad it was only the hat I left in the car.  Jerks.
0,"Be careful using a credit card here.  Michael the bartender charged our credit card incorreclty TWICE!  I had to file a dispute with my bank.  If I go back, I will only pay cash!  It's too bad, with money tight these days, you have to watch very closely."
0,"This place was so packed on a Friday night we have to wait an hour and half for a table. No, we didn't show up at 8 p.m. we strolled in around 5:30.\n\nWe bought some drinks while we waited for our table but they were way too expensive. We played some pool while we waited but it was too crowded to get a good shot off. We finally left after two hours because our table wasn't ready and the other group we came with had been seated and started eating.\n\nDon't go late at night."
0,"I miss Incredible Universe. I gotta put that out there. \n\nThe building that is now Frys electronics was a place called Incredible Universe, and it was a spectacle to behold. The place was amazing and vibrant, brimming with possibilities of what is and what could be in the tomorrow land we were all looking forward to in the world of electronics. Everything was testable and displays of the amazing technology of the day was available everywhere by friendly cast members. \n\nAs a consumer, we were ensconced in the world of the future and everything seemed like it was in reach of us all. Here is today and it can be yours. Well, that's how I felt as a high schooler going to shop for Cd's and things there anyway. I don't know if Incredible Universe was profitable, but who gave a shit? I liked that place. And I miss it. \n\nThat dream is gone. We are left with a carved out sterile version of what was a beautiful store. A haunted wasteland of products available only to those with the strongest constitutions to endure the adversity that is shopping at this place. The staff survives it all with you. \n\nI cant blame the staff for being as binary as they can be. The place  seems to be more of a term being served than a workplace or job opprotunity. The holidays are especially painful looking for the staff and I am sure they are spending most of their days remembering times long ago when they enjoyed the holiday season. Before the dark times....before the empire...\n\n Going to work must feel like a constant struggle for survival. I feel bad for them come holiday season and I understand if they are not feeling the holiday spirit. \n\nanyways, yeah....Frys is the best place to buy batteries and a few things like blank DVDs and such. You can find good deals on the PC games for sure. They are so cheap you cant pass up some of the tittles. It is just not a fun store to negotiate thru. The checkout line feels like a processing line more than anything. \n\n\""Register number 45 fucker...NEXT!\"""
1,"Classic Wisconsin food - cheese & sausage plate, cheese curds, local brews,etc.  Love to take my out-of-town guests here."
0,"Sorry, this was way too expensive for what you got. Our waitress was also a bit misleading when we asked her about the size of the tacos(we asked because we'd been to a place the day before that served happy meal size tacos for way too much.)-she said they were big and filling. I'm now wondering if she said that tongue in cheek cause they were tiny and looked like appetizers. \n\nAnd what's the deal with rice and beans that everybody spoons off from a communal plate, for chrissakes gimme my own plate and make it look appetizing instead of a goopy mess in the middle of everyone. \n\nMy friend got a no frills burrito for $14(nothing else) and a $8 margarita , and also felt ripped off.\n\nI gave it two stars because the hostesses were fun to talk to and the 2 mini seabass tacos I had ($13 with nothing else) were actually amazing. Still wouldn't go back or really recommend the place. Too bad the prices and portions were a joke."
1,"Great pizzas with a nice variety of toppings.  We get the mediterranean and love it.  Have also tried the smokehouse and cheese, both were very good.  Would like more sauce on the pizzas, but otherwise, super!"
0,"My mom and I were waiting for massages next door and decided to grab a bite here at Chopstix.\n\nThere wasn't too much that was special about this place. Since it was during lunch time, I ordered the Chicken Broccoli Lunch Special. What I appreciated about my food is that it was made with lots of garlic! Yum!\n\nThe environment was rather... drab. Though the booths and chairs were all clean, but it felt like they designed the place so that customers are encouraged to want to take food out instead. \n\nAfter I left, I realized they never included my egg roll with my lunch special! For that, I give them 2 stars instead of 3!"
0,"Putting aside my complete \""what what WHAT the crap\"" level of shock that anyone feels the need for four shots of espresso... my friend and I get pedicures right across the parking lot so once in a while we stop over for drinks. Today we went over,  the drive through was backed up which is pretty typical but there was only one person waiting at the window so we got in line. The person nearest the window had clearly finished ordering and was waiting for drinks, the person in the window looked at us several times and continued to go on with her conversation asking the person what their biggest pet peeves are about working at a Dutch Bros. Hers incidentally are having to open or close with new hires who she said are \""like totally incompetent\"". Two stars for sub-par, over priced drinks and a serious lack of customer service."
0,Don't go.. really poor service.  Sat and waited for 25min to get a beer no such luck.   The servers just kept walking by me like I was invisible.   I could understand if they were busy but I was the only one sitting in my row.  I just don't get it.   Told the manager and then left.
1,"I really like this hotel. The rooms are definitely modern and up to date. Bathrooms are clean and marbled. Beds are comfy, inviting, and looks new. Updated amenities. The suite was spacious and enough for at least 4 people.\n\nThe pool was amazing. They have a normal pool, a lazy river, AND a wave pool. I am in love with the wave pool! I spent most of the time in the wave pool, and when it's turn off, I'd grab a beer and lounge in the lazy river. There's also DJ/ MC the last time I stayed there, so it was entertaining as well."
0,The viognier was great but my salad tasted like someone poured 10 lbs of salt on it! Go here if you like your food super salty.
1,"Don't let the outside of the this establishment fool you- a great local bar with really great food! My husband and I were shocked at how good the food was and the price tag did not break the bank. The portions were generous and there was a really wide selection. \nLoved that this was a more laid back atmosphere- I didn't like that our waitress also worked behind the bar. Since we were sitting in the dining room, she had to man the bar so she didn't have a lot of opportunity to check on us. But overall a great place to have a quiet affordable dinner with the family and still get very high quality food. \nTry the appetizer platter \""All In\"" - amazing!! Chips and salsa + 2 sliders + Chicken tenders + Buffalo wings + Mozzarella sticks!! WHAT?!?! 3 - 4 people could share this easily."
1,"Love TR! Probably because it is new there were hiccups.  Very busy for 3:30 on a Saturday.  Our server disappeared on us for about 20 minutes.  We had to pull another over to get us refills.  Wait was not too bad.  Food was good.  I ordered 1/2 BBQ chicken and initially they brought me the 2 small boneless breasts.  Quickly rectified though. \n\nI debated 3 Stars, but I will go with 4 on our history, TR."
0,"The waiters are pretty hot.. well not all of them but many.. the food is so so.. service, if I had bigger boobs I think the service would have been better.. would not return.. I wake up to a hot man every morning so I have no worries about checking the waiters out again."
1,"One of my most memorable dinners I gave had...ordered the 5 course prefix that is a must do. The service was impeccable, dinning room was very nice...."
0,"This place is starting to show it's age.  The casino and lobby/registration areas are in dire need of a make over.  The rooms have recently been upgraded and I'm not a fan.  The pepto-bismol pink in the bathroom almost burned out my retinas.  And the frosted sliding glass door on the bathroom?  Bad idea. If you have to go to the restroom in the middle of the night, that light is going to seep into the sleeping area and not be very diffused.\n\nThe location on the strip is great though.  It's easily within walking distance to just about everywhere."
1,"For a local lunch spot, this place is great. The food is always excellent, and the servers are very friendly. The prices are incredibly low, making it one of the best deals in town.\n\nService is sometimes a little slow, but that's a small price to pay. The place could use a little \""sprucing up\""... it's a little dated and run down."
0,"Below par diner food. Fried zucchini is all breading and no zucchini. Anything fried always comes dripping in grease, I know, I know it's diner food but it doesn't have to be so greasy it makes you physically ill. I'm a big fan of blt's and there's is pretty poor. Small portion with very little meat and dry bread.\n\nBesides the food, the service is so so. Last time I was in I asked for a lemonade and the waitress forgot it, asked for mayo and there was none on my sandwich, and this was on a slow day\n\nWith eat n park down the street and Pamela's not too far away it seems you have much better places to get you're grub on. I'm giving it one star because I can't see myself ever coming back or recommending the place to anyone else."
1,"This is the spot to be early afternoon when you're in Pittsburgh. Any Pittsburgh sports clothing you are looking for is here for a decent price. The farmer's marketing is the reason I visit the Strip. I have found strawberries for $1! You can't beat those prices.\n\nThere are also boutqiues and other markets to browse through. Parking can be kind of a pain, but it is always worth it! The stores typically close early, but there is some nightlife. The Altar Bar, a popular music venue, has bands playing most nights."
1,"Convenient, cheap, fast and great for a meal on the Strip!  \n\nDon't expect a packed meat sandwich and a carnivore's favorite sandwich, but a sandwich that is simply good when you're hungry and want a clean meal!\n\nI got their Original, which was aye okay!  I love drenching my sandwiches with mustard, so I did that with the Original!  It was then bomb diggity.\n\nAlso, this sandwich place is opened around the clock!  What a perk!"
1,"The Espy is a delightful wee bar situated just off Portobello beach.\n\nIt looks nice, the food is nice, the staff are efficient and they have a variety of beers on tap (a couple of which I hadn't even heard of).\n\nI was attracted to this place purely by the peculiar but charming shape of it. It peeks out near the beach and looks a fair bit more upmarket than some of the more traditional pubs on Portobello's High Street.\n\nIt is, however, very laid back, from the prompt but chilled out service to the general vibe of this place. Best enjoyed on a rare sunny day after you've dipped your feet in the sea and fancy nipping off the beach to grab a cooling pint or wee cheeky glass of wine."
1,"I love seeing all these quality spots coming to Highland Park. As the neighborhood I grew up in, HP has always been a great area, but spots like Park Bruges are really making it a destination.\n\nI stopped in for brunch and was pleased to see a brunch menu with varied choices as well as a prefix option.\n\nLike it's sister location, Park B offers great food, great service and a great atmosphere - Pretty much all you could want in a neighborhood restaurant."
0,"Another horrid burger experience in Vegas.\nHow hard is it to get a fresh made in house burger?\nImpossible in Vegas it seems.\nKGB is hidden in the back of Harrah's wit ha bar in the front.\nThere was an older couple waiting in front of us forever, hosts and waiters hushing by, completly ignoring them.\nI had enough and we grabbed menus and sat down since there was barely anyone there eating.\nFInally when a waitress came I asked if they make the veggie burgers in house, nope they get them frozen.\n$14 for a boca burger, no sides, really?\nAND shitty service to boot, screw you and off we went again."
0,"Some of the reviews seem dated and it appears the show may have changed up a little since changing venues over the past few years. I just stopped in this week at the Sakes Theater in Planet Hollywood (a bit of a trek past the V theater). It was a 4pm show and it was not very crowded. Theater is small but at least a GA ticket seat still was pretty decent.\n\nFull disclosure - I did get in at a discounted price so can't complain too much. Still, the review is based on the show, regardless of price paid. Since I had a GA ticket, I waited in the long line around the corner as other reviewers had mentioned.It didnt really bother me as the line was not all that long. I also did not see any pre-show like some reviewers mentioned. The first thing I saw upon entering (and getting my photo taken) was the AGT video clip from Nathan's days on AGT. My comment has less to do with showing the video clip but the poor quality of the video and the screen that is way up near the rafters. It is a small screen and the quality looked like a film clip from the 50's. Really in this day and age with a 16:9 aspect ratio, Ultra4HD quality video, that first impression was an omen of things to come. The sound was bad, the video horrendous and quite frankly seeing the hoff and brandy as judges just reminds us how long ago that he was on the show. Plus when you consider that the magicians/illusionist on the most recent season blows away Nathan's act, well...\n\nThe tricks alluded in other reviews like the disappearing acts are accurate. Not too impressive. Music makes it up tempo so I didnt fall asleep but it doesnt mean I was wow'ed. In fact that is what I would categorize the show -- it is missing any kind of \""wow factor\"". He also did the typical prediction in the locked box trick that copperfield does as well. I wasn't impressed with that either. I wish all magicians would just get rid of that old and dated trick.\n\nThe show also included the comedian with the masks tricks and making them do these embarrassing things and popping a balloon.  Again not a magic show and it does kill alot of time along with the upfront video so yeah, this show doesnt come close to an hour long.\n\nYou are handed a card at the end of the show to review them on tripadvisor but I wonder if Nathan or anyone else takes these comments constructively and make appropriate changes to make the show better. With the discounted tickets and small audiences I wonder how much longer this show can last. Moving from theater to theater is already indicative that it has no staying power. If you can get a cheap ticket and need time to kill, take a chance but dont expect to be wow'd. Not the worse but definitely could be improved. I will check back to see if future reviewers indicate whether the show has changed for the better."
0,"If you are a Chinese food junkie like me, try another spot. This is the kind of place which gives Chinese food a bad name. Over-fried, greasy and downright tasteless. I had the Kung Pao combo.... the Kung Pao sauce was a gelatinous mess with everything from zucchini to bell peppers thrown in. It was actually hard to tell where the chicken was hiding. The \""alleged\"" fried rice was still in the shape of the ice cream scoop when it arrived. The \""fried\"" rice had fused into a starchy ball. And did I mention the egg roll. Hmmm, maybe I did't because it was one bite......and off to the trash."
1,I love the Wynn. I love the buffet. I love the plethora of desserts offered at this buffet. I love how the food looks and taste fresh despite it sitting in a steaming warmer for countless ppl to poke at. I also love that its around $25 for me to go up countless times for hot/cold/salty/sweet items until I feel my pants start to burst. \n\nWynn Lunch Buffet...HOORAY!
1,"Made 6:00 dinner reservations.  Arrived at 6:00 and requested to sit outside since it was a beautiful night and the hubby and I had never seen the show.  They sat us outside just in time for the frog and this was just the beginning of one of the greatest meals of my life.\n\nWait staff was extremely attentive but never overbearing.  We asked the sommelier for a recommendation for a red wine between $80 and $100.  He didn't give us a look on the price point, stayed within it and recommended a GREAT bottle of wine. We started with the foie gras - which was amazing and a BIG piece.\n\nHubby got the filet, I just ordered the wedge salad and told them I would have some of husband's steak and lobster mac and cheese.  Again, no look, just great service.  Took our time before the La Reve show, got to see a few incarnations of the outside show, had a great time and a great meal.\n\nIt is expensive but ABSOLUTELY worth the money."
1,"I've had the jalapeno bacon stuffed pancakes, they're to die for every bite is hot and sweet...we've never had a bad meal and always recommend it!"
0,"I've had excellent meals at another location, so I stopped by this location recently when I was nearby. The order takers were young and looked bored/unenthused. Loud and at times offensive dance music was being played through the house speakers. When an order was ready, the server didn't have a very loud voice and often looked frustrated that nobody could hear her call out the names.\n\nWhen my food finally arrived (the spicy chicken plate) the chicken had been overcooked and spiced unevenly. The noodles were good, and so were the vegetables -- still a good value for your money considering the quantity of food -- but this is not the place to have a quality relaxing meal. Overall it reminded me of a high school cafeteria with dance music. I will eat at the other location if I want this food again."
1,"This is the most authentic Thai restaurant in the US outside east Asia! We started with beef satay and as the peanut sauce and beef hit my taste buds it took me right back to Bangkok. Followed up with some fried tofu with an outstanding sweet chilli sauce. The crispy duck in Penang sauce was unbelievable... the truly crunchy outside and soft meat was unexpected. The chilli rating from 1 to 10 was an added plus. I like slightly hot -spicy and a chilli rating of 6 for the Panang chicken was just enough to make it uncomfortably good! Lastly, the mango and sticky rice was perfectly done, ripe mango with warm pudding like, slightly coconut flavored sticky rice. The beauty of Lotus is the subtle seasoning that differentiates the ordinary form the extraordinary. Portions were generous and service was very good. Don't be put off by the strip mall entrance... or the price ($70 with tip for two) as it is really \""Thai\"" food."
1,"Why 5 stars? \n\n\n\nThe Vibe\nI have tried several different Crossfit  gyms (aka Boxes) and I must say that CrossFit Haboob has been the first place where I feel like home. The hardest part about getting into a new place to workout is feeling comfortabe, like your not being watched/judged by every person in the joint which from my experience in the Tempe/Scottsdale area seems to happen quit often. Not here. Right from the get go everyone at Crossfit Haboob was welcoming and supportive and that really made me feel comfortable which in turn gave me confidence to really let myslef get into the workout.\n\nThe Coaches\nThe coaches are great. I have issues with mobility and form on certain movements and Sean and Ben have been very helpful and supportive. Taking time to work with me on an individual level during each WOD (workout of the Day) when it came to a movement I needed improvment on. Never codesending and if you go to them with issues they will help you find a solution to make the workout work for you. Probably the best part is just how friendly they are, which sets the tone for the entire place. At Crossfit Haboob you feel like you are with friends right away.\n\nThe Price\nI am paying half of what I was paying at another box and I get to workout more each week. Other places charge twice as much for 2-3 workouts a week.\n\nThe Community\nHaboob does things I have not scene other Boxes do before when it comes to making it a community you feel part of. They hosts events, encourage their members to participate and provide a social aspect for the gym. It makes you feel like you are part of a club rather than just a member/number at a gym. \n\nSo Crossfit Haboob is getting 5 stars for being a chill, welcoming box that is really fun to be a part of and also has some awesome coaches at an affordable price....AND last but not least they will let you put your ipod on if you are not feeling the music that day.\n\nDo not get me wrong, the workouts will kick your ass."
0,"I was so excited to try El Burro because I like the round corner so much. Well it's sad to say I do not feel the same way about this place. I had the shrimp burrito, the contents were soupy. As u could imagine it was very sloppy and runny. I ordered chips & guac as well. How could you go wrong there. I got home and opened the bag to see the chips were drenched in oil. I mean like everytime I touched a chip my fingers were glistening! I will post a pick of the bag of chips an 2hours later. i love homemade chips but they need to lay these out in a draining bin before they bag them. Very disappointing. Maybe the were just having an off day, but I don't know if I will gather the courage to try again."
0,"One thing you can't deny about this place is that it's in a great location - right next to Uni, George IV Bridge and only 5 minutes walk from busy South Bridge.\n\nFor that reason I've been a handful of times for a drink after lectures with friends and I have to be honest, it's location is the only reason I'm giving it as many as 2 stars! The drinks aren't that cheap (\u00a33+ for a pint), and on the one occasion I had food there it reminded me of school dinners, if I'm completely honest!\n\nThey do offer 20% off food/drinks for students and NHS staff, but compared to the multitude of cheaper and better bars less than a stone's throw away, it's not enough to make this place stand out.\n\nA friend of mine convinced me to go and give this place another try, and so we went to try their new promo lunch menu for \u00a34.95... when we got there and found that there was a choice of a grand total of 3 dishes to choose from, we decided not to bother.\n\nI haven't experienced the bad service that so many other people mention in their reviews, that is one thing I should say in defense of this place. But it's still not exactly somewhere worth rushing to."
0,Minimalist happy hour.  Bartenders rude (and it was slow- early in the afternoon). Ran our tab on the card to hold the check without asking if that's what we wanted to do. Chicks in bikinis on the street trying to get people to come in.  Prices too high for strip district beer.  Smelly.  Upstairs looks like it's a club at night.  Rough crowd started to come in as we were leaving.  Good for a quick beer and that's about it.
0,"Sometimes I will occasionally venture into this Dollar Store.  It's right next to Fry's so it's very convenient!  It is very small, but I only go here for cleaning supplies so I'm not on the hunt for much more.  It's fairly clean and it's for some odd reason very quiet throughout the store.... \n\nFor a Dollar Store it's honestly not that bad and it's in a great location.  When I need a new plastic broom I will return here :D"
1,"This dominos always does a great job on my pizzas. Sometimes we pick up instead of getting it delivered and The people who work there are friendly. When we get it delivered, the drivers are always nice and the pizza hot. I usually get pepperoni and mushrooms or salami and mushrooms and the ingredients always taste fresh."
0,"Airport location, Monday, 6am.  10 minute wait just to be seated, when the restaurant is 1/4 full. 10 minute wait to be served, at the bar.  20 minute wait until the food came, right as I decided it had taken too long and I had to board my flight.  Absolute garbage.  Never again."
0,"Horrible service!! Three of us ate here this past Sunday, 11/20/11. Our server, I think his name was Tony, took our order without explaining that the entrees do not come with rice. That alone is not too bad and we dealt with it. The problem is Tony never checked back with us the entire time we were there! We had to order the rice from a different server. We also didn't have any soy sauce on our table which all the other tables did have. Again no one stopped by our table so we could not ask for a bottle of soy sauce so we just had to take one from a different table.\n\nYes the food was pretty good, but overall this restaurant is totally not worth the price!($17 for three glasses of iced tea?! Our overall bill was $75.) There are plenty of other great restaurants on the Strip where you will get great food and excellent service. I will never go back to this restaurant!"
1,"My family and I have been regular patrons of this restaurant since before yelp even existed!! The owner, Hiro-san, is the friendliest man ever :)  When I was a little girl he would used to carve me flowers and animals out of carrots in his spare time to keep a bored kid in an adult's dinner party happy and occupied. Now that the restaurant's so successful he has barely any time to make it in and out of the kitchen! But he never fails gives us a huge grin and welcoming wave whenever he sees us.  The staff here is so friendly that when I walk in the doors I always feel at ease.  It's the same feeling as returning home to food and an experience that I KNOW is going to be amazing and satisfying.\n\nNow on to the food...my family and I come to this restaurant AT LEAST once every month.  Since this place is a must-go whenever we have guests visiting, and we've had numerous guests visit us this past month, we have been to HIro's once every week!  Even with all the frequent dining at this restaurant for so many years, we're never tired of it because it is JUST THAT GOOD.  The food is authentic (as I already knew but again confirmed by my visiting friends from Japan) and the quality very fresh.  The following is a list of our favorites:\n\n- miso soup- no explanation necessary :)\n- spicy tuna roll\n- catepillar roll- ADORABLE looking and everyone whose had it swears it's delicious.  I believe them but I don't eat eel so I've never tried it.\n- toro- excellent quality!!\n- hiyayakko- cold tofu with bonito flakes paired with scallions and ginger.  Pour some soy sauce over it and you have a light, healthy, but tasty appetizer.\n- nasumiso- miso glazed eggplants. You can't go wrong with this one, trust me.\n- hamachi kama- yellowtail collar.  The meat is so tender and the sauce they have with it totally makes the dish.  Be sure to squeeze some lemon on it as well!\n- dynamite- a seafood mix baked in a special sauce.  This is a dish you won't see elsewhere.  It's very rich but also very unique.\n- halibut carpaccio- raw sliced halibut with sliced scallions and tomatoes.  They pour hot oil over it to half-cook it.  Kind of Italian-Japanese fusion, and very creative!\n- zaru soba- authentic Japanese soba noodles. Refreshing and perfect for a hot summer day.\n- green tea ice cream- if you're feeling up to desert, definitely give this a try.  Green tea is my personal favorite and it's actually hard to find good quality ice cream in that flavor!  Their GT ice cream is definitely NOT the cheap gross ones I've unfortunately purchased once at a supermarket...\n\nThat should be enough to get you started! There are so many more great dishes I could list but these are the ones we always come back to :)  Branch out and give everything a try! This would be the place to try new things because you can be at ease knowing that anything you order will be of a certain caliber. We tried the sesame roll for the first time yesterday and it was surprising, creative, and delicious.  :)\n\nHopefully my super long, and way overdue review of this restaurant will convince you to go try it out, or even just try some new dishes!  Now go make your reservation...I promise you won't be disappointed!!"
0,I'm a sushi fan and heard this was the best place in the city. If that's the case then Montreal sushi is in trouble. The sashimi appetizer was good but nothing to write home about. The Sushi was average and the maki - which I understood to be their specialty - was over-done - dipper and fried and then poached and seared and sauced (I exaggerate but u get the picture). And it was over priced..\n\nTwo stars for good service  and nice decor.
0,"I'm just gonna have to stop and call this place out.\n\nFirst, I typically love $2 tacos. I'm all about that. But this place is scum.\n\nWe waited in line for 20 minutes. Not because the guy was helping another customer...no he was replacing cheese that didn't need to be replaced. It was like half full. Second,  after he replaced the cheese he stuck some in his mouth and started eating it with his gloved hands. After the cheese he decided the ketchup bottles needed replacing too. All the while me and everyone behind me are watching this guy and getting more and more pissed.\n\nAfter we called him out on that to change his gloves after sticking it in his mouth he decided to be a jerk and stick the hottest salsa they have on our tacos. I asked for mild, not suicide hot. Couldn't even eat my damn taco.\n\nI am so pissed."
1,"Great Food & Great Service all for the Perfect Price.\n\nKiss the Cook offers you the small town feel of your local breakfast cafe but with this country hospitality through the nick-knacks and woven baskets for sell. The menu offers the basics of any small town brunch style restaurant and for the quality, I'd say the price is unbeatable. One of their trademarks seems to be their small muffins, and I'll admit they are pretty darn good! Not the only thing I'd come here for by any means but defiantly never have a problem eating the ones they sit in front of me ;)\n\nOne thing to keep caution for is the wait. The parking lot is rather small and the restaurant is much smaller.. so even on a typical weekday for brunch you'll find yourself waiting 30 minutes or longer"
1,"If you are looking to celebrate an occassion with a bang, and want your friends, families, or co-workers talking about that awesome cake you just bought, buy a bunt cake! Want to get in good with the big man? Get a bunt cake.\n\nI think their presentation, taste, and creativity of a bunt occassion cake is genious! The presentation is very clean and whimsical! The taste is wonderful, and the cake is sure to soft and spongy. My favorite part is the frosting-thick, creamy, and sweet. Reminds me alot of that nice frosting that is glazed on a Starbucks Lemon Loaf cake (excluding the lemon flavor of course). It just pairs so well with any flavored bunt. Suggestively, get the red velvet or chocolate. It is sure to win the hearts of others.\n\nOnly downside, it is pricey. I assume because of the quality and excellent presentation. If you're crafty, try making one yourself, but if you prefer to avoid any chance of disater, buy a bunt! Even sample the miniature ones! It's sure to win your heart."
1,"The Trader Joe's chain is my all-time favorite grocery store, and this particular location is no let-down.  \n\nIf you are unfamiliar with Trader Joe's, do yourself a favor and VISIT NOW!!  This place is reasonably priced and all the food is both delicious and healthy.  My favorite part?  Free samples!  Always available and useful because you can try new products without having to purchase them first.  \n\nAnother great things about Trader Joe's is their wine selection.  I have pretty much stopped buying wine anywhere OTHER than TJ's, because it is so cheap for the quality.  My favorite is the Santa Barbara Chardonnay for $3.99/bottle.  That's right.  $3.99.  Even cheaper is the legendary \""Two Buck Chuck,\"" assorted reds and whites by Charles Shaw for $2.99.\n\nOther food favorites:\n-Laughing Cow cheese is VERY low calorie at 35 calories per wedge.  Trader Joe's exclusively carries the Bleu Cheese variety.\n\n-Pimento cheese spread is not very healthy but is very tasty.  \n\n-Cheese crunchy things are like Cheetos but not as fattening.  Very tasty.\n\nCan you tell I like cheese?  \n\n-Low calorie and delicious frozen Soba noodles.\n-Assorted hummus.\n-Great deals on frozen fish, easily thawed and grilled.\n\nAnd much more.  Go explore for yourself!  Bring a reusable shopping bag and register to win $50 worth of groceries, given away weekly.\n\nAnother great thing about TJ's is the staff.  They are always very friendly.  Sometimes their cheeriness is alarming, but I generally appreciate it."
0,"Their standard excuse for everything.....we are undergoing renovation.  When it comes to having no working light switch in your room and the over head towel bar falling on your head in the shower that is NO EXCUSE.  These rooms should not even be rented out.   (Especially at $100 and $190 a night) In addition, there was no available hotel parking for hotel guests (not even valet parking) and the bell hop that was supposed to help us with our luggage (before driving the car  to Ballys to park) never showed up.  Try asking to speak to a hotel manager......after 10 minutes they are still on the phone (probably avoiding speaking to angry hotel guests)."
1,"When here after seeing it on food network.  The country potatoes and steak omelet with a side of bacon is what I had along with their honey lemonade.  Food was great and service was pretty good.  Everyone was super friendly, it just gets so busy that the work crew can't attend to everyone all the time.  I would definitely go here again.  Probably one of the best breakfasts I've had!"
0,"Been a local supporter of this business since 2007. Have seen it grow through the years. Happy to see the owners are doing well enough to expand, sad to see the lack of employee happiness-they all look miserable to work there, and the big guy making pizza on Friday and Saturday needs to be cross trained on how to work the paging system when he puts out pizza. We ordered our pizza at 8:12, and didn't get it till 9pm because the guy didn't page. Just let it sit there and get cold. After 15 -20 minutes of doing nothing with it, he set it under heat lamps in the kitchen while he closed the pizza line down.  Starving, I finally went up and asked the cashier. All she said was \"" your pizza isn't out yet? That's weird.\"" Greatest guest service ever.  I asked another lady closing the gelato down, and she said \""here's a pizza in the window, it must be yours.\"" No apology-nothing. \""We have been having trouble with our pagers from time to time.\"" No lady, your pizza maker is working with half a brain! I was too hungry to ask for a refund or ask for a remake-so I ate it-semi warm. They were clearly understaffed for a Friday night-I can see how the owners save money on labor costs.... it's really sad to watch a company get too big for it's britches. Seems they have forgotten about all the locals who supported them to get where they are today....there is a new olive and vinegar shop that opened up in the mall where I work-gonna support them a bit and see how I'm treated. Extremely disappointed."
1,Very great service and variety for both my toddler and I.  I heard the owners really put heart and soul into this business. Superb local!\nVery great service and variety for both my toddler and I.  I heard the  owners really put heart and soul into this business. Superb local!
0,The staff here were vultures. They kept sending different people after me to try to talk me into something I wasn't asking for and didn't want. I wouldn't even consider going back. People like that need to find different jobs because they are giving dealerships and car brands a bad name.
1,"Your standard gas and mart.  Very clean!  As some of you may know, the road from Phoenix to Las Vegas is fairly devoid of services for much of its length.  So, while driving in the dead of night, spots like these are oases.  Drinks, chips, gas, and bathroom, all with friendly service.  Thanks!"
0,"I picked this restaurant for my birthday dinner with my cousins. I'm attracted to 'made-to-order' restaurants that can accommodate someone with a severe dairy allergy, but unfortunately I chose poorly. Let me caveat by saying that the rest of my family had an amazing meal here. The atmosphere is cute, the server was very sweet and accommodating, but sadly the chef was sloppy and careless. After explaining my dairy allergy, the waitress brought me my dinner. After two bites, I felt a tingle on my lip and proceeded to fork a piece of penne, which had a long string of cheese attached to it. The waitress was extremely embarrassed and apologetic & took my entree to the kitchen, where the chef denied that there was any cheese in the dish, but begrudgingly made another one for me. The second round tasted awful and was missing the shrimp I had ordered, but at this point the rest if my party was almost finished eating, so I just let it go. The waitress was nice enough to take he shrimp off my bill, but not the entire dinner. I mean they only almost sent me to the hospital. In any case, this is a nice restaurant but steer clear if you have any dietary restrictions. Made to order? Not so much."
0,"Walmart is a horrible company and this location definitely meets the bad reputation Every time I go in there I have an issue . Items incorrectly placed on shelves and they won't honor the prices that are listed, disgusting floors and areas, customers walking around in their bare, unsocked feet. This last time they wouldn't even honor a two dollar coupon from a manufacturer that actually lists Walmart kindly as caring their product (I alerted the manufacturer that they would not honor their coupon). I strongly suggest you boycott Walmart. If not them entirely, at least boycott this location!!"
0,"New here, many years in Minnesota.\n\nHas a few tables but I think they are working more to the take out.\n\nA clean unassuming place with neutral colors.\n\nA somewhat limited menu. No lunch specials.\n\nI understand the need for pricing, but with that I feel too high is the current prices.\n\nOne orange chicken, one chow fun and one pot sticker of the crispy kind.\n\nI believe the pot stickers were deep fired. They were decent in flavour.\n\nChow fun was plentiful, but lacking in nuance, or in other words bland. The noodles seemed more like a basic wide egg noodle to me. I brought it home to spiff it up. \n\nThe orange chicken was too plentiful and was spicy with a definite orange flavour with white rice. \n\nThese items were served as is, no ad on such as one would get with most lunch specials.\n\nThe young lady who took the order and brought it to us was very enthusiastic and cheerful while answering all of our questions.\n\nI really do not know if I will be back simply because I have had better food at a lesser price.  \n\nI hope you and others try it and find it to your liking because I want everyone to succeed"
0,This meal was a disappointment for my husband and me. The service was not great. There were a few larger parties and we were left hanging a few times. It seemed like we were a bother. \n\nThe beet salad was yummy and hubby's filet had good flavor but lacked in the presentation. I liked the flavor more than he did. It looked blah. \nWe asked which side was a good one and went with the hash browns. What a waste! They were straight out of a freezer with a little topping. Not what we expected. \nThe prawns were good. \nGreat wine selection with some very affordable options. \n\nNot sure we would go again...\nI would rather get a cab and go to nearby Capital Grille.
0,"I feel bad having to give the Venetian only 2 stars.  The hotel was amazing.  The rooms beautiful, clean and comfortable.  The service was top-notch.\n\nBUT...the scent they pump through this hotel is so overpowering you can literally taste it.  I asked the front desk if a perfume bottle broke or something and they proudly told me it was their signature scent, \""Seduction\"" (translation=cheap old lady perfume).  It is pumped through the air ducts.\n\nKnowing what we do now about chemical fragrance products being toxic ...I can't believe they continue to do this.  It's in all parts of the hotel, even the restaurants.  When I left the hotel my hair even smelled like it.  :(  \n\nI really did love the Venetian, but this made me not want to spend my time there or come back."
1,"The margaritas are very good although presentation could be better.  We shared the tuna nachos as an appetizer and it was very good.  I had the new mexican spiced rubbed pork tenderloin and highly recommend it, extremely rich and flavorful!  My girlfriend had the roasted \""hacked\"" chicken and it was also excellent.  As a side we both recommend the roasted corn with grilled cactus, lime and cotija, it stole the show!  In my opinion the greatest side dishes ever!!  Phenomenal food Bobby!  I will be eating here again!"
0,"Over the last 5 years or so, I've eaten lunch at Dilly's Deli a couple dozen times. The location is excellent, as it is near my office, and the interior d\u00e9cor is clean, modest, and charming. The music seems to vary, but on today's trip, it appeared to be a mix of oldies and jazzy easy listening. While I've never had to wait for a table to clear, seating can be limited during lunch hours. The service is friendly and quick and the menu offerings plentiful and interesting. Vegetarians will find a handful of options here, though it is likely you can request to omit meat from any sandwich or salad. \n\nCarrying Boar's Head ingredients is a plus, however the way their sandwiches are assembled and the ratio of ingredients used simply doesn't work for me. Oftentimes, I find my sandwich has a bulge of deli meat in the center and much less (and sometimes none at all) toward the outer parts nearing the crust. It has been my experience that the wraps are not treated this way, though the only wrap I've tried (Mexi) lacked flavor and tasted processed. \n\nI've eaten one salad at Dilly's - the Greek - and, while it is tasty, I discovered a dead fly in it halfway through and haven't ordered a salad there since. \n\nAs other reviewers have reported, the soups aren't as piping hot as I'd like, though the variety and additional \""daily soup\"" is appreciated. \n\nThe bread is deliciously soft, warm, flavorful, and large - ideal for accompanying a soup or salad. If you're accustomed to filling up on a sandwich made with normal-sized slices, I suggest ordering a half sandwich so you can sample a side of soup, salad, or dessert as well. All sandwiches are served with a pickle spear.\n\nThe cookies and brownies get 4 stars on their own.\n\nToday I gave Dilly's another shot and ordered a new menu item, the Red Bird, on wheat. Personally, I'm not a fan. The Blazin' Buffalo, Dilly Bird, and Smokey Mountain boast far better flavor combinations, IMO. Also, my pickle spear had a hair on it.\n\nDilly's is a bit pricier than its nearby competition (All whole sandwiches are $6.99), though a reasonable price if shared.\n\nOverall, this is a higher quality sandwich shop than Subway, Blimpie, and the like. Unfortunately, the fly and hair experiences combined with the bread/meat ratio issue guarantee I will not return."
1,"Got here relatively early to hopefully get in without having to wait over an hour like other people at the back of the line.  How they choose to manage entry here was so strange that night.  Basically even if you're near the front of the line you won't be let in so easily.  If you know a promoter or tip one of the bouncers you'll get in a lot quicker.  I figured we all tip the bouncer $10 to get us in quick and had him on the line, a friend in the group said wait and in the end we paid $40 a head to get in anyway.  Didn't have a problem with paying this much since it was my first time checking out XS and had won some money anyway. \n\nAfter that, excitement starts to set in after walking through the side entrance to enter in with the awesome outdoor pool landscape.  Secondly, the awesome quality of the sound system which is smartly hidden into the architecture and landscape.  Probably cost them millions for this incredible acoustic setup.  Found out this place is like 40K sq. ft. which is probably the biggest club I've been to.  And yes they have a number of tables on the island area of the pool, which can be useful.  Just make sure you're gambling before you get your drink on.\n\nThe drinks aren't insanely expensive like I've heard they might be.  I remember buying like four shots of patron for like $53 including tip.  Dance floor area is cool but too tight with how many people are there.  Lounge areas are good and the pool view is sweet everywhere. Honestly, I can see why this place is the one of the best clubs in the US but supposedly it's losing its luster as newer Vegas clubs open up and compete."

0,"This review is strictly for Relish Burger Bistro located at resort by golf club. I visited there on 6/28 during happy hour for my friends birthday. We had a reservation from Open Table yet when we arrived it did not matter. Lots of seating available. We were told to sit anywhere and different servers came to us inquiring if we had reservation with slight attitude. Why do it matter if the place was pretty empty? Waitress took time to take order and our table was not bused whole time there. Food was mediocre. Mostly the happy hour menu is limited. We only ordered that menu for food but drinks were off both menu. Drinks were pricey and the non-alcoholic sparkling rosemary limeade I ordered was $9 and had zero limeade. Alcoholic drinks were good but pricey at $9 - $12 each. Waitress seemed annoyed, disinterested, and fake. We decided to split our check evenly by giving our credit cards and cash and she said that was too complicated. So we all waited for new individual checks. Had she asked or seemed engaged in party from start that could of been addressed. Service was fair, customer service was lacking, taste & cost was poor to fair. Not a place I would return to....."
1,"I've never had a bad meal at this restaurant. The quality and consistency is excellent. The owner is the head chef, And will come to recognize you if you are a repeat customer. The ordering and seating routine is a little unusual. You stand in line and place an order and then get a number. Only then are you supposed to sit at a table. This does make sense since people cannot just sit at a table when there's a long line of people waiting to order. Just an FYI. The crapes are simple, but always good. I usually get the tomato and cheese and add an egg. The coffee is okay. I only wish they opened a little bit earlier."
1,"An air traffic controller strike in Jamaica almost cut short my honeymoon. A US Airways employee worked for 3+ hours to get us there the next day. Only because of her is why I like US Airways. Normally, I can't stand any airline or airport."
1,"Stopped in for a quick lunch with my Mom and found the place to be quite remarkable. We were greeted warmly and told to sit anywhere. Ordered up tacos, two each, chicken, pork and carne asada.  Street taco size and very tasty. Mom had tacos as well and as this was just a way of killing some time we did not sit for a full meal. I will be coming back, soon as time allows to experience more of this wonderful little shop. Had no trouble parking right in the driveway. I asked inside and was told it would be alright."
1,Great place to have a casual meal on the strip - -two outside levels that overlook the strip plus the indoor eating area also-- your choice! \nGood show inside at dinnertime also.  Dancer who goes down the volcano and into a blender!  I have eaten off the menu and all  is good!  Get the conch fritter appitizer !
0,"Okay.. the good first: my partner really, really likes this place. It's the only pizza he eats, and pizza is pretty much his favorite food. He usually gets the thin crust/well baked sausage pizza, sometimes the deep dish, but for him, no complaints. So that's nice! \n\nThe bad: God, I fucking hate this joint. I don't like pizza, but their menu is big enough that when we do order in, I can try and get something new. Half of the time, they'll screw the order up. (Did I want a chicken parm with pasta? They send the sandwich. Did I want the chicken parm sandwich? They send the pasta.) Usually when this happens they'll send someone to fix their mistake - we've had quite a few times where they completely forgot half of our order - and that's pretty good of them. They always seem polite about it and service is fairly prompt.\n\nBut honestly the food isn't that good. It's greasy and bland and if I wanted mediocre Italian food, I'd make it myself. I'd say we go here once or twice a month, so this isn't a one-off thing - if  you like stuff that's bogged down with oil and cheese, great. If you want to taste what you're eating, well. Go somewhere else."
0,This place sucks!!!! It took 45 min to get a ford ranger cleaned! And there was only 6 cars in the entire place! Staff were all joking around and goofing off instead of cleaning the 6 cars on the line! Vacuum job sucked and the interior window was just a smear of dirt! I will never come back here!
0,"Worst place I have ever lived at.. The office said is very unprofessional, shady, and do not care about their residents. I WOULD NOT recommend living here.. Justine doesn't even know anything about the industry and is dumb founded about everything. When she first gave us our apartment, she gave us a handicapped one.... We were not going to live in a handicap apartment. Then she told me that an actual unit would not be available for another month so she made a stay in another apartment until our apartment was ready.. Tony the maintenance Guy is constantly buying drugs off other residents which one instance I witnessed it. The buildings are very pretty and has a lot to offer, The landscaping is phenomenal and the pools are wonderful. But in order to make more money for the company and to have the business grow I believe that you need to weed out some of your staff members because they are the reason why people are submitting their 60 day notice. I signed a year contract and I am being kicked out of the apartment by management because of my dog that I have which don't forget he does have a paper from my doctor stating the fact that he's my service dog."

0,"Might have been better if McDonald's burgers came with guaranteed entry to Tao's nightclub.\n\nDescended upon Tao with a bachelor party for a bachelor party-sized spread and activities.  Tao the club was buzzing, and a deal including dinner at the restaurant and bottle service in the club for about $150/pp was actually a pretty solid deal.\n\nUnfortunately, Tao's food is nothing to write home about.  Essentially P.F. Chang's with even more offensive interior decor, Tao's \""Asian\"" food is basically designed for the lowest common denominator - the Midwestern palate.\n\nSpring rolls were okay.  Potstickers were okay.  Crispy orange chicken came straight from the cauldrons of Panda Express.  Soy ginger salmon was okay - the udon was a bit unruly though.  Desserts were excessive.  What the hell were they thinking with a chocolate-filled egg roll?  A bite guarantees an oral blast of too-sweet chocolate, versus that same blast recreating a chocolate necklace on your clubwear.\n\nBut yes, we did get to skip the Tao line.  Maybe a solution would be to pre-eat elsewhere, then just drop the money for nightclub purposes and save yourself the culinary dishonor."
0,"I still haven't changed my mind much from the last time I was here but they have changed a few things. You can now add a steak for $5 or 1 lb of crab legs for $6 to your $6.99 buffet. \n\nIt's the standard Vegas buffet, pretty small with so few choices, they do have charbroiled hamburgers and sausages. But they got rid of the hand scooped ice cream & now have the machines which really sucks that was the highlight of this buffet. \n\nThe prime rib was par roast part rubber. .The  chicken and tacos were good overall its not bad for $7, but still I usually only go when it's comped on my players card.\n\nThe service is non-existent here-get your own drinks and they hardly come around to clear plates. However they did redeem themselves at the end with some good coffee."
0,"The MGM group is pretty stingy. I stay at the hotel, spend lots of money at the casino, have M Life membership, and they still hit me up for $10 to get into the Cathouse.  I get up there and there are only about 20 people there. It wasn't a terrible place, but come on guys $10 for that really? There are lots of better bars/clubs around with no cover."
0,"I would not go again. Parking was an absolute nightmare. \nThe value for money was just not there, and they had no where to sit or be shaded."
0,"I'm going to start this off with this...$6 for an order of string fries!!! There is a thing called know your customers and this place has not heard about this. If this restaurant was in Scottsdale it would probably work well. But this is at 7th st and Thunderbird. Prices here are outrageous. Burger, fries and a drink is about $18. I'm not exaggerating prices either. My wife ordered the 5 cheese sandwich and it was bad. Just a huge blob of cheese on some bread. Extremely flavorless cheese log. I will not be back to this place and really want my $40 back. \n\nIf you notice, the only good reviews on this restaurant all refer to the owner Joe so these are all his friends and of course they are going to give a 5 star review.\n\nHeed my advice and go somewhere else. $6 for a side of fries!!!! I still can't believe this."
1,"There are two places in the valley that you should definitely write home to mom about when it comes to wood fire oven pizza. \n\nThis is the other one. \nThis is the one however that you can get into pretty much whenever you want. \nThis is the one that you know has better pizza than 99.9% of the rest of them.  \nI would come here if I didn't have all night to get some really first class pizza.\nI would bring someone here to give them the experience anytime.\n\nLocated in what most would consider the fringe of the ghetto... It certainly is a bit out of the way. This small pizza place has limited parking and seating for maybe 20 people max in the entire place. What it lacks in space in certainly makes up for in taste. It's BYOB too if you are into that type of thing... (There is a liquor store with a bad selection next to it... but I certainly would recommend stopping somewhere else).\n\nYou need to stop in and have one of there BIG pizzas, for me it set a new standard somewhere in my brain. All the quality of something authentically Italian sans all the hype. Prices are reasonable. Owner/staff world class... Tiny... but I have gotten have there a tad early no problem just sitting down... \n\nTheir crust seems a bit mushy I will admit so a fork maybe in order. All and all one of the best places for Italian and pizza hands down."
1,"It's a little pricey, but you get so much lobster. I like that they let the lobster do the talking and it's not too heavily seasoned or globbed with mayo. The bread was perfect, too. All-in-all, I really enjoyed it and have no idea what people are griping about. Fries were excellent, as well!"
0,"Went to get some food before the airport at this little Mexican spot. The bartender was friendly and greeted us. \nOur waitress came out and asked if we wanted drinks but wasn't listening to us as we ordered. She had a really bad attitude when my friend said she'd like her soup first (sounded like fast) so the waitress goes, \""we'll try as fast as possible but i can't rush anything, what else do you want?\""\n\nAfter the food that came, the beans smelled like sweaty old shoes, the burrito was cold, the fajitas had two pieces of chicken. Yes we counted, and took a picture but lost the phone before I could post. Our bill came out as soon as our food came out. Repulsive service and equally repulsive food!"
1,"We come here often. Great coconut chicken soup! Not a fan of the Pad Thai - too sweet.  Everything else is excellent.  You can take the kids, but  I would say after eight its an adult atmosphere."
1,Great customer service!!! Will return!
0,"So after reading the reviews, I was ready to be blown off my seat. That did not happen with the burger(s) sadly.\n\nThey made us wait 2 hours, thinking it might be shorter time we gave it a chance. The staff is not friendly add they don't even have the Decency to give out snacks while you wait. With a pregnant wife and a 2 year old we waited because we wanted to have these amazing burgers yelp recommended. Yeh their average at the best.\n\n2 hrs later when out seats were finally available we were seated. Our friends ordered the shakes before the burgers. I didn't because I wanted to eat the burger. In hindsight I should have orders the shake instead. The shakes have actual chunks in it. I tasted the shakes and they were nothing like I have had before... So the place should be called shakatory.\n\nWhen the burgers finally arrived, they lacked flavor and substance. Mildly juicy. Again the standard was the 4 stars. Unfortunately the burgers disappointed. At least the meat burgers. Te chips sucked really bad. Don't be shamed into tying the fries it the chips.\n\nIf you want VEGE burger though... That's another story. The best place for a vege burger period.\n\nLong story short for a meat burger place it's a flop. Try a 5 guys instead."
0,"I thought the PGA Superstore was a good place to get clubs re-gripped atleast, since it is hard to get service on the floor to get info about clubs.  The conduct of the man who does the re-gripping is horrible.  I would know his name but his name tag was turned around.  I was happy that the man could do this process in an hour, I returned an hour later only to be ignored, then questioned about what clubs were mine, he helped someone else that came to the counter.  I received service once I said I was heading out to my car, the clubs were finished and behind the counter the entire time.  Just a schrewd bitter man that can't multi-task and hs zero communication skills."
0,"CHEAP! STINGY! MISERABLE! \n\nAfter all day of walking around on the Strip, I was starved. We found Fleur by chance as we explored Mandalay Bay. My BF wasn't very hungry, so he chose something from the \""small plate\"" section of the menu, which, as it was explained to us, was similar to Tapas style. Since I was very hungry, I ordered \""slow cooked salmon\"" from the \""large plate\"" section of the menu. When the orders arrived, I was shocked to see that my \""large\"" plate was no more than the \""small\"" plate my BF ordered. It turned out to be a thin section of salmon, laid out on top of  6 slices of cucumbers, with sauce. After I devoured the salmon, I was still hungry. So I thought, \""ok, then I will order dessert.  That should fill me up.\"" So I ordered \""Brownie Lollipop.\"" When that arrived I couldn't believe it either. Four little lollipops... and nothing to do with Brownie really, mostly mousse. You have to understand, that after all day walking around, I NEEDED CARBS! I looked at the menu again, and saw in SMALL PRINT, that bread is available upon request, but with a charge of $1.25. At this point I didn't care, so I called the waiter over, kind of voiced my complaint that the \""large\"" plate was no larger in portion size than the \""small\"" plate, and asked him to bring me some bread. He said, the bread is dinner roll with olive oil on the side. When he brought it, he was not kidding, when he said \""dinner ROLL,\"" because it was ONE dinner roll, with olive oil on the side. I had to laugh out loud, because it was SO stingy and miserable. The night before we went to another restaurant at another casino resort, and they brought lots of bread, free, and their price was no more expensive. \n\nSo no, I don't recommend this place at all. Spend your hard-earned money somewhere else for better food and treatment. Plenty in Las Vegas!"
1,"Just recently went up ti visit the lot in the hunt of a reliable, and decently fast car. I ended up spotting a beautiful Mustang they had. Upon inspection, the car was very clean and kept in good shape. Other than a light rain from earlier that day, everything was in shape. We meet up, and they were extremely friendly! They made the test drive seem fun, while keeping it professional. The paperwork took a bit, but overall shorter than most other locations I've been at. Our entire experience there was awesome and friendly! The car drove back home with no problems, and hasn't experienced one at all. I really recommend GreenLight Auto Sales!"
0,"I only write reviews if I have excellent service or terrible service. The few times I've got my nails done, it's been average service. The usual. 2wks ago I thought I'd try the oh-so-popular almond shaped nails. Pretty nice. I come in today and I get the male owner to do a fill and fix a broken nail. The male owner was obviously too preoccupied to concentrate on my nails. He got up 14 times! Yes I counted. And did an absolutely horrible job on my nails. Crooked almond shape, sharp edges, globs on clear polish, air bubbles, and you can see my nail under the black power!!! I'm debating on going back in and have the original guy redo them."
1,"The fancy is in the food!  This by far was the second best chinese food I have had (other place was in China Town in San Fran).  I ordered the Sesame Chicken and it was just the right flavor, and crispy and not doughy.  Very nice quality food."
0,"Stagioni needs extensive work to get on the level with Barringtons or Good Food. The service perhaps needs the most work. Went this past Saturday, and servers were exhasperated and inconvienced. Not really what I was expecting from this restaurant group or after waiting a month to get a reservation. The servers need more training. We only ever got water 1 time, and once we finished the small decanter, we were never refilled in two hours. Certain parts of our order were forgotten/our server didn't appear much at all. \n\nThe layout and seating are insane. They could do without atleast 5+ tables. Particularly in regards to the tables on the perimeter (the two tops)--I could hardly get into the booth to sit down because there was less than a foot clearance on either side. This restaurant is doing too much for a space this small. All of this could maybe be overcome by outstanding food, but it was really just okay (not on the level of Barringtons at all although the price points are a bit lower). There was a small piece of plastic in our appetizer. Writing this review so that they can get control over the service paricularly if not re-envision the layout."
0,"Save your money and spend it on a reputable food truck like slidin thru. \n\nFor the money that you spend here, the quality of the food is terrible. \n\nPlus the owner like to single out groups of people."
1,"I would've given it 5 stars, but when I first walked in and sat on their really nice patio, for about 10 minutes the wait staff completely ignored me. I ended up sitting at the bar, and the bartender took my order right away.\nThe food (5 stars): I ordered grilled chicken with quinoa and it was delicious!\nOverall, definitely a repeat."
1,"See my other reviews on this chain. Great selection. The reality is you won't find sales. However, you're really not spending that much more than if you went to another quality grocery like Harris Teeter, except this place is even better. \n\nPS the parking garage at this one is extremely tight. Proceed with caution."

0,"This chapel is ghetto and incompetent. They charge extra fees for stuff, and charge WAY to much for pictures and your not allowed to take your own pictures inside the chapel, which is bogus since your paying so much to get married there, in our case have your vows renewed there. They also CHARGED us 50$ to have my dad marry us! Why? Who knows, its not like they had to do anything extra to have my dad stand up there. We also went back the next day to buy the overpriced 90$ dvd of the marriage, waited an hr and they still could not find it, had to leave and they said to come back later cause they were open till midnight. We came back around 930pm and THEN they decide to tell me, after waiting another 20mins, that the dvd guy LEFT FOR THE DAY!  I asked if they could call me and let me know if they find it, since they said they record all the weddings yet my mother in law clearly heard them say they werent recording ours and we dont get a dvd, they told me no they could not call and never gave a reason which is all bull. They have crappy customer service and RUDE incompetent people on their staff."
1,"We had to talk our way in at closing time, and we're glad we did.  As a large group eating family style, we had the chance to try a solid cross section of the menu.  All dishes were excellent, especially the panang curry.  The extensive wine list is a bonus, and the server's recommendation of German riesling was spot-on.  Be a bit careful with the spices - their \""medium\"" is anyone else's \""ultra-hot\"".  So nice to find a hyped restaurant that lives up to the hype."
1,"The first time I came here I was dissapointed.  I thought it was too hoity, too pretend fancy.  I've subsequently been here at least ten other times and have been so taken with the food that I think this is the best place to come when I want a relaxed deconstructed meal.  The flavors are all there, but the presentation and use of ingrediants is always surprising and a delight.  Everything from the bread to the dessert is amazing.  I will say that you'll have to spend a bit, but it is worth every penny.  The restaurant is airy on the inside, even though it is in the same parking lot as a Safeway next to a nail shop.  But once inside, you'll think you are in a restaurant in California, like a mini vacation!"
0,"I've been to Margaritaville in Key West. I've been to Margaritaville in Jamaica. \n\nHell, I had the distinct honor to do a shot with Jimmy Buffett once. Damn right I'm going to hit this Margaritaville while in Vegas.\n\nI ordered a burger, it was alright. I had two island lagers, they were fine. The bill was a little stupid. There was a cover band playing for about 5 minutes when we sat down for dinner. Because of that, it added another 10% \""entertainment\"" tax to my bill, on top of the regular sales tax. I asked my server that if we had waited 5 minutes, would we still have been charged. She laughed, and shook her head.\n\nRight on. Would have been nice to know that before we sat down. To add insult to injury, they didn't even play any Buffett while we were there. \n\nIf your coming to Margaritaville to break your Buffett cherry for the first time, skip the Las Vegas destination."

1,"Post Offices are places where I usually grumble about having to go to, but this location is the one that I grumble the least about visiting. It's all about the location. If you're coming in from the South it's easy to get off the highway right before the tunnel and be at the Post Office. When you get out of your car you get a free view of the McCarran air traffic. Hey, there's the Virgin Airways 747 again! And dang it's loud and it's big cause it's just right across the street from you!. You have easy access to the outside boxes to drop and go, and they pick up the mail later than other PO's do. And if it's tax time, this is THE PO to go to if you want your taxes postmarked in time and want to do it as close to midnight as possible...and maybe pick up a brief TV appearance in the process. \n\nIf you go inside and the counter is open service is usually fast. And yes you can get passports here. I've had a PO Box here and was very pleased with the service and support received. Overall I consider this location to be the best PO in Vegas, hands down. \n\n4 Stars based on almost 2 years of frequent visits."

1,"One of my favorite spots in Charlotte to share a beer or a bottle of wine with friends, or just to kick back after a long day at the office. Though it has hundreds of bottles to choose from, Vintner is SO much more than just a wine market. You can also get lost in their diverse selection of craft beers, including the nearly 20 they rotate on tap. And the appetizer selection, while not extensive, is enough to provide a tasty accompaniment to any drink. \n\nI absolutely LOVE that Vintner's is just a short drive from us in South Charlotte, and plan to be back MANY times in the years ahead!"
0,"We went to Eggspectation after a recommendation from the concierge at the W Montreal.  Our requirement was simple... breakfast within walking distance.  \n\nOver the food was fine and really not the main reason for my low rating.  While it wasn't spectacular, portions were good and it was tasty... just not great.\n\nNow let's talk about service... simply put... SLOW!  There seemed to be no sense of urgency despite a line of people waiting for seats.  Our waiter was pleasant but terrified and absentminded.  Honestly I'm not sure it was an issue with his ability or the fact that the place seemed severely understaffed for a Sunday morning.  The whole place seemed like a perfect candidate for one of those takeover shows that works to turn a bad business around with a few easy and logical steps."
0,"Excellent food but horrible service. The first dishes were brought out after about 15 minutes of ordering, but the second round of dishes were brought out one hour after that. We were still hungry but did not order more as we did not want to wait for another hour. No apologies or explanation was provided for the delay. \n\nThe wait staff did not seem trained as they removed the plates before we were done without asking us if we were done. \n\nWould not come back and would not recommend, even though the food was good."
0,"Worst hospital ever! Keep driving! \n\nA pair of scissors fell off the counter and punctured the top of my foot. I was dropped off at the hospital and I was bleeding really bad, like bleeding through my wrap and my foot was covered in blood. I was hopping on one foot to get to the desk and they just watched me. There was no one else that they were helping so I felt like they should have got off their a** and brought me a wheelchair. I even asked for a wheelchair and they still didn't bring me one. They gave me paperwork to fill out and I had to hop back and forth to the desk to fill it out and then bring it back.  As I waited with the 2 other people in the emergency room I started losing feeling in my foot.  I once again hopped back up there and told them that I couldn't feel my foot and up through my shin. I asked them if I should be concerned by this and they just stared at me like I was interrupting their conversation about them hating their job.  I then started experiencing terrible pain which seems odd when the foot is numb but it happened. When they called my name I told them that I couldn't hop anymore across the lobby in my flip flops, plus the hopping made my hemorrhaging foot hurt worse.  The lady actually rolled her eyes and had uptight body language while she was trying to help me get in the chair. When they took my blood pressure I once again expressed the concern about my numb, yet in pain foot and she didn't even respond. I was finally wheeled back to the Dr and the Dr said she would give me something for the pain. They did give me a tetanus shot and to my surprise brought me my discharge papers. I refused to sign them until they cleaned the wound. I had to ask them to wash all of the blood off of my foot and I asked if they were going to bandage it up. The guy walked out not saying a word and came back in with a band aid, stuck it on and walked out.  He then returned with discharge papers again and a script for some pain pills. I asked him how I was going to fill that at 12am because I had a foot that I couldn't drive with. He told me \""at a 24 hour pharmacy.\"" Duh! My point being that my foot was numb but in terrible pain, still bloody and he expected me to hunt down a pharmacy? He finally brought me a pain pill to get me through the night and I never did have to fill that script he gave me because by morning I had lost all feeling. This happened in April, it is now October and I STILL have no feeling. When I read my home care instructions the paper totally said that its a concern if I experience any numbness with a puncture wound and to inform them.  \n\nNot to mention, I was sharing a room with a lady that had bronchitis and when she was taking her breathing treatment the tube kept popping off of the oxygen because they had it set too high.  She kept yelling for help because of this and she couldn't breathe but they ignored her... We were both pressing the nurse button and they just kept talking and laughing out in the hall. I even had to yell out to them so they would come and help her. They seemed so irritated that they had to come get this lady's breathing treatment squared away once more. God forbid anyone in the emergency room actually need help. This is absolutely the worst of the worst for hospitals. Honestly, whether you have to drive further to a different hospital or go to this one... You are still risking your life but I bet you would have better chances elsewhere."
1,"Well, I have learned a basic rule about Mexican restaurants, if it's crowded its good (Or it's happy hour). I got nervous right off the bat, I chose this place the parking lot was almost empty and it was about 12:30 or right in the middle of what should be the lunch rush. We were seated right away in a nearly empty restaurant. From there I can say good chips though they say award winning chips and salsa, but the salsa tasted like El Paso out of the jar. The rest of the meal was outstanding. I had the Green Chili con Carne burrito enchilada style lunch special with green chili sauce on top. It was an amazing taste sensation. The beef was not shredded but more like tender stew meat seasoned to perfection and the beans and rice were pretty good too. My wife had the shredded beef taco lunch combo, She said it was good but about average for her. She really liked the chips but was not impressed with the salsa either.  I liked the novelty of the shirts they sell there, but in my circles I couldn't think of a time it would be right to wear it they say \""Excuse me, It's the frijoles\"""
1,"Ordered a grilled chicken salad and sangria.  The dressing on the salad was very tasty.  Shared some tapas with my sister- the brie/apple/almond combo was delicious. Great ambiance -- dim lighting, friendly wait staff, and a wall dedicated to wines alone.  Live musician playing cover songs on acoustic guitar - phenomenal.  In addition, they held a wine tasting and I got a little lesson on wines! Hope to come back again the next time I am in town"
1,"I love Los Cardos. I first discovered it living just over the road from it, and not being one to turn down Tex-Mex, I became a fan. The portions are big, the food is tasty, and the ability to customise your meal down to a tee is a big selling point. That and the prices are really reasonable, you'll get much more for your buck than from most other takeaways. Another great thing is that the packaging is eco-friendly.\n\nPersonally I like to get the quesadillas, and dip it in Extra Hot salsa, with a little sour cream (good that they don't charge extra for this, although there is a charge for guacamole). My boyfriend's a fan of the burritos, which are huge. I've even got a jar of the Roastin' Red in my cupboard.\n\nThe food is great, but I can't bring myself to give it 5 stars.  Firstly, the Just Eat menu does not have the full menu - it's missing the tacos. I really enjoyed being able to have one chicken, one steak, one carnitas etc but no more. Secondly, the most recent quesadilla I got was cut into two very thick slices rather than three slimmer ones and as a result much more difficult to eat. And thirdly, because I moved that wee bit too far away to go and collect it and instead rely on delivery, I'm not able to use my loyalty card anymore (I did ask). When I lived over the road from it I was racking up stamps like nobody's business, but now the card is sitting in my purse unused. Boo. I appreciate it's difficult to verify how many stamps someone has before you order (do you bring free tortilla chips with you just in case they're about to receive stamp five?) but I feel a little like my previous loyalty is wasted. And I want my free tortilla chips!"

Very poor Customer Care and a very bad place for Tennis lessons.\n\nStaff is clue less and Management does not care too. I STILL have not got my money Thiefs !!"
0,"Poor management, Darrin, the store manager obviously has little management skills and cares little about repeat customers. Hires incompetent managers that treat customers very poorly and allows extremely long lines. Managers that don't even train employees in basic customer service skills. Can walk through the store on Saturday and not be acknowledged at all."
1,"I just went back there with a friend for Monday lunch. Since she had never been here before, and we were both starving, we decided to order 3 items and split them: soup of the day, grilled mozzarella kabob and salmon davida (yes, again, it was that good). \nThe soup was tomato based, with cauliflowers and some other veggie, with a slice of toasted french bread with spread. It was delightful, and the bread's spread was slightly tangy, enough to kick off your appetite.\nGrilled mozzarella kabob came with a \""head\"" of romain lettuce, also grilled; big enough as a salad entree. The whole dish was drizzled with olive oil and balsamic vinegar. \nSalmon davida (refer to previous review)\nAdam, our waiter, was outstandingly friendly and got our items split in half without any hesitation. Love this place!\nP.S: good for small group"
0,"Just came back from that festival. I don t want to be bad. We are from Europe. This is a real joke. Between charlemagne ( 8th century), the elephants, and the renaissance it is almost 600 years between!  You pay 20 dollars for what! Park your car maybe in rocks!.you must pay everything inside. 1 dol to 6 dol at least. Just for rides. Family of 6. It hurts!. + food(awfull) drinks( I am not sure they put any alcohol in the cocktails($6 each). Go once and never go back. Good luck!"
1,"Very clean, fresh toppings"
0,"Pumpkin Spice. Red Velvet Cake. Friggin NUTELLA. These are the flavors I love the most...if any other froyo joint made them. I have passed by this place many times with my girlfriend, and always meant to stop in due to the sign outside advertising the red velvet cake flavor (my favorite dessert). I finally stopped in the other day to try some. I got some of the red velvet cake and nutella, and my girlfriend got the pumpkin spice. The toppings are irrelevant, because those are standard fare among froyo stores and hard to screw up. \n\nFrozen yogurt, on the other hand, is apparently very easy to screw up. If you like their base flavor and are only adventurous enough to enjoy slight variations on it, go right ahead. But if you're expecting the flavor you get to, well, taste like the flavor you get, you're SOL. Pumpkin Spice tasted like the base flavor with a very slight hint of pumpkin. RVC tasted like the base flavor with a slight hint of cream cheese and chocolate. Nutella tasted like the base flavor with a slight hint of nutella. Due to my high hopes, their flavor could all be summed up as the flavor of sadness. I would recommend just about every other froyo joint than this one."
1,"This is my favorite chain steakhouse in Charlotte.  Excellent food, much better price than Sullivans, Ruth Chris, Chimas...  The house martinis are all good. The seared Ahi Tuna is a must, the chilli rubbed delmonico steak, Baked potato is salt rubbed ust right, mushrooms, and the creme brulee cheesecake for desert.  Make sure you call ahead or you will be waiting.  BTW, the one on Rae Rd is better than the one in South Park."
1,"SETTING: A group of us went here after a long night of dancing and having fun. It was about 3:00 AM on a Friday night (& July 4th weekend!)\n\nAMBIANCE: Spacious! There was plenty of room in between tables. Other guests were there, but it wasn't crowded. There are also some booths for extra-comfy seating.\n\nDISH: All 6 of us got the Steak & Eggs special. For the $6 price, it filled us up nicely! Some of us couldn't finish all the potatoes or bread, because they give a generous amount. They handed the bread separately in baskets and some of us actually forgot to get our bread, but we were full by the time we realized we didn't eat it.\n\nSERVICE: Service was friendly and he came by often to give us updates about our dishes.\n\nOVERALL: I'd come here for late night munchies again!"
0,"I give it 2 stars for bring open on Sunday, but it's really only worth 1 star.  The employees are nice, but everything is computerized and it makes me think that they work on commission.  They tried to sell me things I had previously purchased and they kept lowering the price by a dollar and saying \""so now do you want it?\""  I just came for an oil change.  I expected to be told about what else needs to be done, but other places which actually care about the user experience will print you a list of needs and their prices.  That would have been respectable instead of trying to intimidate you with a computer.  Hahaha, don't even try it buddy:/\nI ended up waiting about an hour and a half to even be seen, but when I called the girl told me I could get an oil change right away:/. When I called I asked to make an appointment.  This place is like a snake.  I. Wouldn't necessarily blame it in the employees, I'd blame it on jiffy lube.  I do NOT recommend coming here unless like me, ur oil is in sure need of change on a Sunday:("
0,"We tried to eat here. I don't know why Paris thought it was a good idea to have this as the only place to get food in their nearly 3,000 room resort after midnight on New Years. On top of that, it looks like they didn't bother to fully staff it so a good number of the tables were unused and many that were being used stay uncleaned. We waited in line for about a hour, partially because they were letting all the Platinum and Diamond members in before everyone else. After a hour in line we were near the front when a group stormed out of the restaurant and told everyone in line to go elsewhere since they had waited 45 minutes for their food and were leaving since they had still not gotten it. This caused everyone in front of us to leave so we ended up at the front of the line, although we were still not seated since there were still Platinum and Diamond members waiting in the express line. After a second group left and told us the same thing (food taking forever to come), we too decided to leave. We waited a hour in line for nothing, although I guess it was better that we left since at least we were eating a few minutes later at another casino. Horrible planning on Paris' part."
0,I had finn this please a couple times when I was driving down tatum boulevard. so I thought that I would give it a try. 25 min wait for a sandwich on a thursday night...and the food is average at best :(
1,"Great food, the lemon roll is my absolute favorite. Fantastic environment. Love that we sat at the bar and got to enjoy talking to the sushi chef. Limited wine but the food makes up for the lack of drink menu. Great experience:-)"
0,"What a dump!!!!  A 6 Motel compared to this place is the Ritz Carlton!!!  Where do I even start?  The interior grounds are acceptable, they are pet friendly and the price is very reasonable... outside of that forget about it!  The cleaning people don't vacuum the carpets, the bathroom floors are disgusting, old paint on everything including on the windows,  the deadbolt on the door would not lock properly, to flush the toilet I needed to hold down the handle until everything had vacated the bowl, I checked the bed before getting into it (to see if anything might be living between the sheets) and finally, my dog would not lie on the carpet... she stayed on her mat!!!  It reminds me of a Slumlord owner that plans never to put one dollar back into the property.  The location should be gutted and completely remodeled... or just demo'ed."
0,"Yes, the Westin still has $3 craps during happy hour, and $5 craps during all the rest of the time. But nevertheless for experienced craps players this is a terrible place to play. The reason: the dealers are not very experienced and there is no pit boss sitting at the table, so that the 3 dealers are continuously carrying on a conversation with one another. The dealers are inattentive and screw up frequently. If you like playing multiple points and are depending upon the dealers moving your come bets to your points and moving your odds to your various bets, it is hopeless. When the dealers make mistakes (which is frequently), they will slide your bet back to you (that should have been on the point that just hit) and say \""sorry, I didn't year you\"". The frequent mistakes they make are never resolved in the player's favor, but always in the house's favor.\n\nUntil they get a permanent pit boss watching over the poorly trained dealers, this is a terrible place to play craps."
1,"Reserved a room at the HardRock for my roommate's birthday and stayed there for 3 days, 2 nights at the Paradise Tower. Our room was very spacious with a lot of closet and drawer space (for 4 girls...!). Shoes, shoes, shoes. Lots of mirrors too! Another plus for a room full of 4 girls.\n\nThe bathroom had a beautiful dark red rock-damask design (weird combination right? but it works!) My only complaint about the bathroom was that the modern design of the showerhead made it have a lot less pressure than one would want -- it barely took the shampoo out! Looks nice, doesn't function as it should.\n\n+1 for room service & the cleanliness of the overall hotel\n\n+1 for the sun-blocking curtains that let us sleep well into the day!\n\n+1 for carrying out the Hard Rock concept so well \n\n+1 for the two really good clubs in the lobby. Packed & poppin. Strong drinks. Best DJ I've ever heard - played a whole chain of the best West Coast songs! Find a recruiter walking around though that will hook you (girls) up with free entrance as opposed to $20.\n \n-1 for charging us $45 for moving the mini-bar dollar shots. If you trigger the sliding sensor for more than 45 seconds, it does an auto-charge to your room bill! We contested this with the concierge and even told them to go back up to our room to confirm the dollar shots were still in place because there was NO WAY in hell we were going to pay $45 for 3 bottles of DOLLAR SHOTS."
1,"The most amazing sushi meal of my life! Come here ready to splurge, but know that it will be worth it. First off - the view of the Bellagio fountains is spectacular! Second - the service is absolutely incredible and Third - the food and drinks can't be beat. \nDefinitely need to try the PopRocks Roll! We had several different small plates and they were all so tasty, but the winner was the roll that came with Korean BBQ Rib on top. They also have some craft Japanese Beers that were super delicious and the perfect ending to our meal."
0,"The restaurant's web site shows that it opens at 11:00 a.m. That is incorrect. We arrived a bit after 11, and that, in and of itself, was a trial. Then, we waited...and waited. Finally, a bit after 11:30, the gate was rolled back. Second in line, we asked for a table by the windows (remember: empty restaurant). The er, um, \""hostest\"" told us that THOSE seats were only for groups of 6 or more. By the time we left, 3 of those tables were occupied (out of about 10), all with parties of 4 or less.  Our waitstaff was attentive, as was the person who filled the water glasses and actually brought out the food. Both orders had been left under a heat lamp too long, and the one order, a pizza, was less than warm. The other order had much to be improved. We will not be returning, nor will we suggest it to out of town guests."
1,Super good food and staff it's extremely friendly. Love coming here every time I'm in the area.
0,It was Laosy.
0,"Like all Fox restaurants (except the new Culinary Dropout at Scottsdale Waterfront), this resturant is just ok, but not great. Starting with the decor, the restaurant is light and airy, with huge windows and lots of patio seating, which is nice. However, the decor reminded me more of a yacht club in the Hamptons than a spot in Mexico. Another big plus is that the hostess (who was friendly and upbeat) gives you a white or black napkins, depending on what you're wearing. I know this seems like a small thing, but if you've ever been given a white napkin while wearing black pants, you'll know the anguish it causes.\nTo the food: As I said above, the food is good not great, but like all Sam Fox restaurants, its overpriced. Its not offensively bad, but its not Arizona mexican. There is just no excuse for serving mediocre Mexican food in Arizona, and this is the reason why I would not recommend Blanco. There are tons of great places in this city to try for upscale Mexican food- Barrio Cafe, and Gallo Blanco are my favorites. The salsa was the worst offender. Serving salsa that tastes like Pace Picante canned salsa is not only unforgiveable, but sets the meal off on a bad foot.\nTry again Sam Fox."
0,"Went to Jimmy's for lunch and walked out with a lunch bill of $74 for TWO people.  There was NO alcohol on the bill. Ridiculous.  To top it off, we waited for 15 minutes for someone to wait on us, and that was only after I finally got up and spoke to the manager.  It wasn't even at peak lunch crowd, in fact, it was about 2pm and we were the only people in the restaurant other than a group of ladies who had been there for some time.  I ordered an appetizer of chicken pot stickers and 6 pieces of sushi.  My business partner ordered a gluten-free meal of salad and shrimp.  Why my bill was $74 I will never know. I guess I should have been more observant.  Won't make that mistake again.\n\nI want to add, this was the Jimmy Wan's on Freeport Road, not the location in Seven Fields/Cranberry TWP.  I've always had good service in that location, although it's still pricy there as well"
1,Small and cozy shop :) Me and my bf enjoyed a great couples pedicure  on Sunday 11/23.  The ladies took their time  on the pedicures and really made it a relaxing experience . The lotion massage at the end was the best . \n Basic pedicure does not include paraffin feet dip but does include  a green sugar/salt scrub . Would definitely  try again .
0,The food was ok. The service was horrible and slow. We got two burritos and we're disappointed in the size for the cost.
1,"Really great pizza, lower prices than other local places, other great food, hole-in-the wall :) Do it!!!"
0,"I was quite excited going to this restaurant for the first time. Absolutely the worst experience I've ever had at a restaurant.\nUpon entering we were instructed to go back outside and wait outside in the cold for a table to clear up. There is plenty of room inside the restaurant to wait. The way they have organized their tables clearly takes up unnecessary room and makes it difficult for the waiters and waitresses to get their jobs done. The store is not ideal for groups since seating is so awkward.\n\nAfter waiting for around 10 minutes for a table in the cold we were disappointed once again by the menu and then by the food itself. The menu is fairly limited has some specials and the traditional ramens. I ordered one of their special ramens and when it came to the table I was SOO disappointed because it looked nothing like the photo on the menu. The taste is also mediocre at best, very salty, full of msg. No unique flavour at all. Compared to even a chain ramen store like ajisen it would pale in comparison. \n\nWhen asking for the bill it was hard getting the attention of the waiters and waitresses and when I did receive the bill they had a very rude attitude. The waitress rolled her eyes and did not give any remarks at having a good day or thank you when receiving her tip.\n\n2/10\n\nI have since visited again and things are not much different, the food itself is still mediocre at best but now they also have all you can eat toast. Not sure how that really relates to ramen."
1,"I have had my son, who just turned three, at GVCS for about a year and a half.  His first teacher, Ms. Jamie, was awesome! If I would've written this review at that time, I would've given it a 5 stars for sure.  However, other teachers have not been that great. The biggest problems we have had are with diapering and toilet training.  \n\nHis current teacher decided she no longer wanted to use the binder where they are supposed to write down information like when the kids use the bathroom, what they eat, etc.which was frustrating because we never knew what was going on.  I will say that when I brought this to the directors attention, she immediately had the teacher start using it again.  It feels like a lot of the work we have done at home in regards to toiling is not supported at school.  He can be at home for a week and not have a single accident, but when he gets to school we are told he didn't pull his pants down far enough and he peed on them.  I don't know if they are leaving him alone or what is happening.  Also, the main teachers leave around 3:30 and the people who close never know what is going on with the children.  I have heard this from several other parents also.  \n\nTo get the best out of this place, pick your kid up by 3:30 or only care about your child being alive when you pick them up.\n\nI love that they do \""chapel\"" every week and take turns preforming, even the little ones.  They also do great Christmas programs including all the kids, even babies. \n\nI never fear my child is being hurt, which is the most important thing.  The other things are nit picky."
1,"I think this is the best Chinese in Charlotte.   Unfortunately, they let their manager  and some of their staff go AND changed what was a very good menu.  However, they will still make you about anything off menu.  Servers are friendly, food tasty."
0,Service could have been better. Curry nothing to remember. Sushi was blah. Katsu seemed like it was leftovers that was re fried. Was really hoping it would be great spot since I live so close by but I won't be returning.
0,"Absolutely disappointed.  When your primary product is pizza and your menu is fairly limited you need to work hard to set yourself apart the crowd.  Unfortunately for me, Grimaldis fell flat on its face from an experience standpoint.  While my previous experiences have been average my latest encounter left me regretting my choice.  This evening I ordered a pizza to-go which you would think would be a simple uneventful task.  Not so.  My son and I stood waiting for 5 minutes before someone even offered to help us without any other customers waiting ahead of us.  Then we watched as the manager proceeded to pull each of the two girls who were handling take out orders away from their job to discuss some errors that had apparently occurred during their shift.  Mind you, this is in the midst of a Sunday night take out rush.  After the second girl got her \""talking to\"" I watched as she tried to compose herself (unsuccessfully) and then proceeded to remove her apron and walk out the door.  That left one poor girl to tend the phones and handle the to-go traffic since the Manager conveniently decided to disappear to the back of the house after her \""talks\"" with the to-go staff.  The remaining girl jumped between calls while to-go orders piled up below her counter.  I had a sneaking suspicion that one of those pizzas was mine, since I had now been waiting over 25 minutes, but I had no chance to ask about it because nobody was around to ask and the one counter girl was jumping from call to call.  After waiting another 15-20 minutes the girl started checking the pizzas and, just as I had assumed, brought me mine from the pile.  When I told her that I knew that this pizza had already been sitting there for 20 minutes she apologized and offered the lame excuse that it was very busy tonight.   \nI have at least 5-10 other pizza places I pass on my way to this place and Grimaldis just gave me an excuse to either try the others again or give them a first try before I return to this place."
0,"The food here is great, but the service is TERRIBLE.  I have been there twice, and the first time I figured the poor and rude service was a fluke so I didn't write a review.  Well, we gave it another try and again...TERRIBLE service.  The waiter acted like we were bothering him, and walked away before we even finished talking.  We waited 15 minutes for our table, which I wouldn't have minded, but the hostess said they had a table almost ready for us when we walked in.  It took forever to get our bill (hand scratched on a notepad), and we were overcharged for our drinks.  Happy hour prices are awesome and I really do like the food, but because of the poor/lazy/rude attitudes of the wait staff I will not be coming back.  The bus boys were very on top of things, but without a better trained wait staff I don't see why people would come back.  Check out Firefly on the same block for even better food and fantastic service :)"
0,"Not good, overall just not good. We had a large group and our poor server seemed so overwhelmed. She actually did a good job getting everyone's orders but then who knows what happened in the kitchen. Half the table never got any food at all, some of us decided not even to order entrees because it took so long for anything to come out. I did get to eat the gravy fries which were actually very tasty. A little too much salt but still liked it. The Mac n cheese was side order size and something I could have made myself. It was decent but nothing to get excited about so whoever wrote the menu is just really good about describing things in a fanciful way. \n\nNow the chicken tenders. I heard the waitress telling someone else that they were so popular they made an adult version. I love chicken tenders so I ordered them. It was like cardboard microwaved chicken. Took 2 bites and sent it back. I was in shock. Chicken tenders are usually so good to me because of the different ways that restaurants bread and fry em up. The tots were like what you get at elementary school lunch. I'm sorry union but for kids maybe okay, the only adults who would eat that are ones who are too drunk to notice what you just put in front of them. \n\nLocation and decor is great. Figure out your kitchen timing, revisit some of the menu items and this place could be really successful."
0,"Ryan B., Jorge L. and I eat lunch together at least 3 days a week and I have to say I'm not sure I'll be back to Urban Grill anytime soon. First of all for a place with the word \""Urban\"" in it... all I can remember listening to there was Goo Goo Dolls and Matchbox 20 tracks.\n\nI digress...\n\nThose two guys had \""The Works\"" burger so I decided to try the Thai Beef Salad. The moment my plate hit the table I wished I had ordered something else.\n\nThe menu seems to have a good variety of options... the street tacos were a possibility, chicken lettuce wraps, I even considered the pulled pork sandwich... yet I opted for this terribly mediocre salad.\n\nThe staff was super nice, the overall vibe of the place seems nice although I can't imagine there's ever more than 25 people in the building at any one time.\n\nIf the prices were a little lower I'd be willing to try Urban Grill again. But if you want to put a $15 French Dip in front of me for lunch... I want to leave with a big belly and a bigger smile."
1,"Who would have thought this place would be pretty cool? I'll admit, I judged too quickly and thought the D would be a bit blah. Most of the reactions I got when talking about this place was \""where's the D?\"" or \""I never heard of that place\"".\n\nI hosted my BFF's bachelorette party in their suite on the top (34th) floor.  Because of the CES convention, suite prices in town were running $500 and up, which I was unable to afford. I scored the suite for about $180 and the staff honored my request of getting the suite on the 34th floor if available. \n\nThe modern suite itself blew me away. There is a wet bar and a huge living area with a wrap-around couch. A small dining table with 4 chairs and 3 bar stools are present as well, perfect for hosting a small group. There's a small refrigerator and a wine cooler built into the counter. The bedroom is separated from the living/bar space. Roomy bedroom with a comfy bed. The bathroom has a huge shower with two shower heads. Different lighting in the bathroom is also available, which is useful for girls that need to primp themselves beautiful. The only complaint I have about the room is that there is no separate bathroom in the living space. So my guests had to go to the bedroom to use the bathroom in there.   \n\nThere's a coney island hot dog place and a McDonalds right downstairs. These two places became super handy when all of us had a little too tipsy. I wasn't too fond of how small the casino was. I felt that the reason why it was so smoky and smelled like burnt ashtray was because of the size of the casino. The parking garage is also tiny and a pain to drive through. General parking starts on the 7th floor. Anything below that is reserved for valet. But can't blame the D for how small the place is - I mean the building itself was built 30+ years ago. \n\nDowntown Las Vegas is slowly but surely revamping itself and is definitely cool again. The D Hotel just adds to the new and improved of the downtown area."
1,"Chef Rubber is my \""go to\"" for SO many things!  Flavor, colorants, sugar & chocolate work equipment and supplies,  molds and forms, molecular gastronomy and my favorite......advice!  If I'm in a pickle, and can't figure something out, one of the staff at Chef Rubber can usually brain storm with me to find a solution.  They are so VERY friendly and knowledgeable!  I get my orders faster from Chef Rubber than any of my other vendors, and they are always accurate.  I teach cake, sugar and chocolate classes all over the country, and I mention or refer my students to Chef Rubber numerous times in each class.  I firmly believe that an artist is only as good as the products they use, and in edible art, quality is even MORE crucial because of it's utilization of all 5 senses.  If you want to improve the quality of your edible art, start using Chef Rubber's products!"
0,Nice place but poor customer service and staff! Always state they are fully booked and not enough cleaning staff. Rooms are not updated and not thoroughly clean.  Rooms not ready to well past check-in time (7pm)..horrible for a family starting vacation.  They have had made major cutbacks since their own new ownership.  Condos is not not even stocked with enough toilet paper or extra paper products.  Greens on golf course were okay definitely not well-maintained compared to the other resorts in the area.  Overall this was an okay resort definitely would be a great place to stay with the family if ownership was different and the place was maintained the way it should be.
0,"For the biggest 21, didn't have such a great selection- especially for the men's clothes.  Crowded and garage-saley."
1,"This store is easy to find, in the mall near the front door,  close to parking.\nMore than that, great selection, good prices and friendly staff.  What more\ncould you ask for?"
1,"Local friends took us here and given the location we were skeptical.   As others have commented the service was a bit disorganized.  But as an east coast sushi snob the food did not disappoint.   We ordered a range of rolls and sashimi offerings (standard stuff, california, spicy maki, tuna) and a noodle dish and all were above average.  The bill with beers for 4 was around $100.  No one left hungry.  Do not be put off by the strip mall location.  This is the real deal.  By the way I have to wonder about the \""Panda Express\"" review."
1,"What a great date spot! So romantic....I could see the Match.com love in the air.....  I have been here over the years several times (no not for Match!), and again last night due to a citipass bogo coupon. It is much better than I remembered!  My friend and I shared the chicken and andouille sausage soup which was DIVINE ($4). I had the chicken marsala and my friend had the seafood risotto. The marsala was probably enough for two people - it was a huge plate of fettuccine with two grilled chicken breasts and a ton of mushrooms. Thank god they are smart enough to do fresh (not canned) mushrooms. So perfect. \n\nThe seafood risotto was very good- it came with 6 mussels plopped on top which were lightly seasoned. My friend said some of the scallops in the risotto were a tiny bit tough but overall it was excellent. Entrees were about 13 bucks a piece, very worth the price! I will definitely be back!!! :-D"
1,"Grimaldi's Grimaldi's.. You have changed the way I view pizzerias forever! \n\nI walk into this location for the first time, I can honestly say it's a mixture of ambiance between The Olive Garden and a typical pizzeria. The moment I walked in I was greeted and seated. The service may be described as polite and respectable. \n\nThe food items ordered were a small pizza and a Mediterranean salad. The pizza had a THIN crust with mostly ingredients being the key volume piece in the pizza. The salad was delicious, fresh and filling. \n\nThank you Grimaldi's for making pizza an eatable food once again without the fear of endless bread enhancers! I no longer feel guilty for eating pizza and PREFER Grimaldi's thin crust over any other pizzeria's pizzas. \n\nGreat service, beautiful location and delicious food, five stars without a doubt :)"
1,good beer!!\n\nfood meh!?\n\nawesome beer selection.\nSicilian tacos are the best ive had on their menu so far.
0,"My first reaction was that the food was kind of expensive.  There were recognizable barbecued meats, but it seemed more liked they were cooked on the kitchen grill than one of the barbecue variety.  There was a good variety of Barbecue sauces from around the country."
0,My mother & were here for a performance and I wasn't impressed. If you're not sitting in the front of the theatre you really can't see what's going on. And a big thing for me is this theatre is not very wheelchair/handicapped friendly. When I was ordering our tickets I think the person that I was talking to should've made me aware of that when I told them that my mom was in a wheelchair. They had to seat us in the very back right by the door and it was very cold and even though there's a lobby and then another door we could still feel a very cold breeze very time the door would open.
0,"Inexcusable poor customer service. It was a \""Please Seat Yourself\"" situation, so we did. There were only two other tables and two booths occupied at the time, yet we were never approached despite there being three different employees in the dining room and we were waiting for over 20 minutes. No comment such as, 'Welcome, we will be right with you\""...no menus provided, no water brought to the table or drink order taken...just a whole lot of nothing going on. We walked out and will never return. I gave one star simply because there is no option to give zero stars."
0,"WELCOME HOME TO \""BIG BROTHER.\""  I have lived in numerous upscale apartment complexes over the years, and never had an issue.  However, living at Canyon Villa is like living under the microscope of management.  The management routinely contacts law enforcement and provides them with the names and apartment numbers of residents who have out-of-state license plates on their vehicles.  Read other reviews from other websites and you will see that I am not the only one complaining of this practice.  I was on a temporary assignment in Nevada and received a notice on my vehicle regarding my out-of-state license plates that had been reported to law enforcement by management. This resulted in time and expense of having to go through the court process to explain the temporary nature of my residency.  One morning, I placed my trash outside my door for a period of 50 minutes and took it out when I went to work.  When I returned home from work, a manager notice was on my door instructing me not to leave my trash by the front door.  That means someone would have had to observe trash in front of my door from 8:00am to 8:50am.  I agree that trash should not be on the front door, but it is very disconcerting to know that management took notice during a 50 minute time frame.  I am a responsible pet owner who always picks up pet waste.  Another day I came home from work only to find a manager notice on my door regarding pet waste, a notice for which I was singled out merely because I am a pet owner.  Another time, I had placed storage bins on my patio.  I received yet another manager notice on my door instructing me that storage bins cannot be placed on the patio.  It was not a pleasant feeling to come home wondering what sort of notice would be on my door."
0,"This place is awful. We took our rescue dog here because of her foster mom had her spayed at this place. a few hours after picking her up from her foster home, to Freedom Animal Hospital after we noticed fluid leeking out of her belly. We are not sure what they did to her but after seeing her and taking her in the back they assured us that she was good. They told us to get some bandages, wrap her belly, and that there would be some leakage. We noticed, when we got her home, that the open wound was still there though this time minus any of the stitches. ( and didn't even bother to clean out wounded area at all ). They didn't even tell us what why kind of antibiotic med or shot was given. We started to get concern about her again and called the emergency Animal Medical Hospital where they told us that there definetly should not be this open wound and we needed to bring her in right away. She ended up needing surgery to clean up the wound and restitch her. We have her back now and she's doing great but no thanks to Feedom Animal Hospital which we will be sure to avoid."
1,"There are several Fat Tuesdays on the Strip:\n- there is one in the Stratosphere (where the stores are, above casino floor)\n-MGM Grand has one (my favorite because its in the MGM of course), you get to it very easy: its just down the escalators that take to the parking, these escalators are just aside from the main lobby, this Fat Tuesday is on the shooping floor of MGM\n-Caesars Palace has another one, just go to the Forum shops, and follow the signs that lead you to the \""Show of Atlantis\"", its righh next to that attraction, just side by side also with the Cheesecake Factory restaurant\n-I also know of onw in the Aladdin, but never been to that one myself\n\nDont know if I am missing any, this place has really good and cheap (cheap for vegas anyway) drinks, try the Jello-shots $2, and pay the extra $1 for the extra shot on your drinks, have fun!"
1,"The Holly Trinity of Eatery Reviews: Atmosphere, Service, Food\n\nAtmosphere: Anton & James (AJ) is a beautiful place to sit down or grab a bite on the go.  Situated on Stanley St (between De Maisonneuve and St. Catherine streets) - it does a great job of being in the mix of it all, but yet retain a type of clean urban look.  The place can get a little crowded at lunch time and dinner, and it does not have abundant seating - but despite this, the decor is such that it allows all patrons to seamlessly intertwine without getting (too much) in each other's way.  There is a long Granite table on the top floor that's perfect for evening gatherings with friends.  Love the set up.\n\nService:  The people at AJ's are very very professional.  Through my dinning experience in Montreal, I've come to learn that AJ's is owned / run by the same people that own Ruben's Deli(s) on St. Catherine's Street, and one of the hallmarks of Ruben's is professional service - this has certainly been translated to AJs.  Pay for your food, and they will give you a number (on a stand), and a waiter, waitresses, or sometimes even the manager will bring the food to you - upstairs, downstairs, or even outside (in the summer time). \n\nFood:  If end up liking AJ's atmosphere and service - you'll come back for the food!  The menu is limited (but expanding slowly) and mainly consists of several types of grilled panini sandwiches - You absolutely MUST try the chicken chipotle - MUST.  Everything is made fresh, and if you order a pizza (good for 1 & 1/2 people), it's made from absolute scratch.  There are usually 2-3 soups of the day ready and hot, and AJ's provides a wide selection of beverages and packaged salads if you're on the go.   They have an absolutely divine deserts counter - that will certainly become a guilty pleasure.  Carrot Cake Muffin, all the way.  Prices are reasonable if a little on the \""not cheap\"" side - but you certainly get you're money's worth - and that's what counts.\n\nBig fan ~ urban chic."
1,"This has become our casino of choice for several reasons. 1) We live less than a mile away, 2) Their buffet is 4.99 for breakfast, 7.99 for lunch and 13.99 for dinner and it is better quality than most although sometimes the selection is lacking, 3) We love Yardhouse and LB's and the movies, and bowling alley (although South Point is cheaper).  Kid's quest is great and not too expensive (8.50 an hour).  They have a great casino rewards card for locals.  Used to get freeplay weekly but they recently switched to more points, less freeplay which is disappointing for me but others seem excited.  They are always giving discounted rooms, free items and the occassional mixer (girls night out, football watching, etc.).  The rewards club levels out once you break into level 2 and reaching level 3 is difficult with little additional reward.  You do get a 2-1 buffet every month.  The circular layout makes it easy to get through the Casino to your destination and the entrances near the bowling alley and movie theater minimizes the kids' exposure to the casino when you just want to see a flick.  The sports book is the best of the off strip casinos.  The pool is the bomb.com and a great place to see concerts during the summer."
1,"I've only had a few professional massages in my life, but I can safely said the woman who massaged me did a good job. I got the Swedish massage and was very satisfied. I especially liked the part when the masseuse cradled my head in her hands and rolled it around in a number of directions. \nBesides a good massage, the staff was friendly and the place appeared to be clean"
0,Had a bad massage here. The girl sat on her butt and rubbed my shoulders. It was the end of the day so she must have been tired. I've had way better at RZ and Studio Z. If I wanted a shoulder massage I would have gotten one from my boyfriend.
0,"On all fronts.. food, atmosphere, service, drinks... SakeBombers is just okay... and that might even be stretching the truth.  \n\nThe sushi is sub-par as are the cocktails.  They do have lots of happy hour and reverse happy hour specials but they are again... mediocre.  Considering that I can walk here from my house and stumble home if need be... I still would rather go eat/drink at MANY other places instead.  \n\nThe volcano roll is not very spicy as it is claimed to be and the wings are a bit soggy.  \n\nThe atmosphere leaves much to be desired... Its like they didn't know if they were going for the asian theme or for a more swanky cool vibe... and they ended up in this bad middle ground that leaves you feeling confused."
1,"I normally don't prefer to eat at chains (though I will on occasion), but this one holds a special place for me. I'd just driven into Phoenix on a Wednesday afternoon, after a long drive across the country. Earlier in the day I'd signed the lease on my apartment and confirmed with the movers when they were coming the next morning. \n\nSo this tired chick hopped on Yelp to find some food -- nearby, familiar, and good enough. I found this Applebee's not too far away and also in the same parking lot as Target (killing two birds with one stone). It was my first meal here, since all of my belongings (read: pots, pans, cooking utensils) were on an 18-wheeler somewhere in the vast Phoenix metropolis. The people here were friendly enough, and I like their \""550\"" menu of dishes fewer than 550 calories. \n\nSo while I've grown fond of finding and frequenting locally-owned joints, on occasion I do hit a chain. This one was there for a very tired chick who needed some hot food and a nearby Target!"
1,First time back at this restaurant in ten years (I used to live here back then).\n\nI am very impressed with how it's grow strong.  Didn't think of it at the time... but ordered pretty much the same dish as I did back in 2001 - monkfish skewers with beetroot coleslaw.  A thousand times improvement tasted.\n\nGuys well done and keep up the good work.\n\nNice decor and friendly service too.
1,Soooooooo good and they let you have your pups in the garden!
0,"My sister raved about this place being so good and seeing it on triple D, but I beg to differ... we went here while my family and I took a little mini vacation to Vegas before the kids started school.  I didn't like anything we ordered,  the Sicilian wings were flavor less no hint of lemon what so ever. The white pizza we ordered was way too oily and seemed uncooked in the middle of the pizza. We also ordered garlic fries that could have been fired a little longer, I could keep going but I won't... I will not be ever returning to this established ever. The waitress was nice and helpful,  the sun was hitting us straight in the face and she did everything possible to shade us by putting pizza boxes up on the windows."
0,Good food... worst service on earth.   Staff has no idea what is in their food.   Manager argued when we got bill with multiple errors.   Too bad we will never go back because of horible experience because food was pretty good.  Walked out shaking our heads at how poorly trained the staff is.
1,"After being a client at a studio (c) in sundial plaza and paying a ridiculous amount ($500) for the standard cut and color I decided to try salon chella. So happy that I did. Not only was the price 1/4 of the cost at the other salon, the result was 10 times better!  Go see Kim."
0,"So, I'm pretty sure I got ripped off here. From the prices listed on the website, kalbi tang ranges from 9-11 dollars. With tax, it shouldn't be anymore than 13 dollars. Having just moved to the PHX area from SoCal, I was hardcore craving some Korean food. A few weeks back, I scoured yelp to find this place. I ordered the Kalbi tang to-go and was charged 15 dollars. I was a bit surprised at the price seeing as cost of living was so low here but happily paid while giving a tip to the lady working the front because I didn't know any better. I went home, opened up my mediocre soup and continued to stew. 15 dollars was a lot for the soup I got. Something didn't seem right. I went online and low and behold, the price wasn't right. I think the lady charged me extra because she thought she could and pocketed the difference. Horrible!!! So not a fan of shady practices and this place seems to take the cake. I really wish she hadn't done that though. I would have been an excellent customer seeing as choices for Korean food are limited in this area."
0,"I feel like the owner had a bet as to how much money they could steal from a customer that day. I was charged for services I didn't ask for, quoted on other products that were so outrageous I almost threw up. $400 to change 2 radiator hoses? seriously? I'm talking about 2 belts that can be purchased for less than $30.  \n\nI was a long time customer that loved the service initially then found it to be more and more suspicious as time went buy. In the end you just knew you were getting ripped off, but it won't happen again. Go somewhere else."
0,"So now that I am the second one to review the Cinco De Mayo Massacre I will sail away in the boat of Asshole with Matthew C. I understand Cinco De Mayo is like a national holiday for drinking and eating lard filled Mexican food but holy frijoles this place was ridiculous.  As far as I know one of our fearless leaders called and made prior arrangements for seating for our group. Well, by the looks of it, they reserved the waiting area for us and forgot that we wanted to eat.  \n\nMy night started off crappy after standing at the bar trying to get the attention of the ladies working the bar for about 20 minutes before leaving the bar empty handed and frustrated. We then finally got seated and the waiter asked us what we wanted to drink... We ordered  Margaritas in hope we would be put into a Tequila Coma and that was not the case.. It was like pounding a bottle of Margarita mix hold the tequila. \n\nNext Misti Y.  was awesome enough to hook the table up with the table side guac, and I happened to be sitting with a group of other \""Hot and Spicy\"" fans so we asked for our bowl to be HOT.... I think they took the lead of the person making the margaritas and kept out the main ingredient. Jalapeno. \n\nSo by this point it was damn near Seis De Mayo and they took our order. We all put our orders in at the same time and i will say that all the food came out quickly... Well almost all the food... Matt C. was sitting to my right with nothing on the table in front of him. we all tried to get the attention of the waiters and when they finally listened to us, we said,\"" he did not get his food\"" the waiter said okay let me go get it. About 10 minutes later we had to stop him again and this time he had to ask Matt what he had ordered and basically started this process all over again.. Horrible!!!!\n\nYes, I did open the door for them to earn another star back from us in which they did, but I am glad Matthew C. did not end up with a chipped tooth or something worse. \n\nI will not be back to this location... Esto era horrible y nunca voy a estar de vuelta"
1,"Double Stuffed Potato Spring Rolls.... amazing! \n\nI am a huge cafe fan. I love them. This cafe inside the Palazzo is awesome! The staff at the bar is hilarious and friendly. Alex, one of the bartenders knows his stuff. Everything that he has ever suggested for me to eat from the menu has been delicious. \n\nThe appetizers are some of my favorites and Nadia (I think) makes a mean Texas Tea. \n\nI have only ever sat at the bar, so I cannot comment on the dining areas, but usually it seems so fast paced and everyone on top of their game. \n\nTry out this cafe if you are in the neighborhood."
0,This store is usually understaffed. It is the second time I left without making my purchase. Boca Park seems to have more staffing at the busy times.
0,I came into this place expecting good service but I guess not. I came here with 10 family members but unfortunately we couldn't be seated on the same table. So our food came and my table consist on 2 kids and 3 adults. The portion of the meat at my table compared to the other table of 4 was tremendously smaller. Not only this but the service was really slow and I don't even know why it takes so long to take out raw meat. Another thing that pissed me off is when I was cooking the meat on the grill and everything was already set in place the employee came and TRIED COOKING For us but FAILED. When she left the meat was not set on the grill correctly so we had to wait even longer to eat our food. And lastly stop deciding whether or not you can give us less portions than other tables cuz the kids stopped eating and turning off the fire when we still have food still cooking.
0,"I feel bad 'cause I know this is a local owned business, it's close to me and I believe has been here since I moved here in '94. Used to be the only store and I never had a problem with it. The employees are great!  Not sure if more selection has raised my awareness or if this place has just degraded in what it offers.\n\nPrices vary - all the markets play their games, price this low to get people in, mark other things up to make the profit. But the selection of fresh produce is lacking and the meat is really mediocre. I have shopped AJ's and it appears Eddie Basha is sending all the good stuff there and placing the leftovers here. Never a great selection, overpriced and I have been really disappointed with the beef I've gotten here.\n\nHope they can stay in business but I actually drive a bit out of my way to hit the Fry's as they have a better selection of produce and meat. Not great but better for sure. I go here now only if I'm in dire need of some staple item and am too lazy to drive the extra few miles."
1,Nice cool place with a Euro brasserie feel to it. Great Portuguese and Mediterranean food with a modern twist. The weekend brunches are fantastic.
1,"We've visited this little sushi place a couple of times and it's never steered us wrong. Our favorites: Godzilla Roll, Cowboy Roll, and the Green Bean Tempura that was recommended by our awesome server, Phyllis! \n\nGreat service, quality sushi, a great place you might overlook being in GV casino. But one of our favorites!"
1,I saw Franco Harris at this place he was a class act great place to by real food from Italy
0,"I went to Cadillac Ranch on Wednesday 5/8/13 with 3 friends. The reason we chose CR Tempe was because they have a great patio overlooking a stage at Tempe Marketplace where the winner of \""the voice\"" would be singing that night. We were told it was going to be a 25- 30 min wait for the patio- not a big deal. 45 minutes later the hostess finally takes us to get seated and she tries to put us at a table on the back patio. I asked to speak to the manager (since I told her we came there solely for the good view of the stage and good service) and miraculously we were sat at a front patio table. Our server was actually great- she made sure we were taken care of and was happy we were sat in her section. To be clear-this one star review has nothing to do with her. I ordered the sliders with chipolte ranch, my friend ordered a salad with chipolte ranch, and my other friends shared the tacos. The food was pretty good and the concert was awesome. It wasn't until later that night I found out that something about my food was actually not good.Around 1:30am I woke up with a very upset gargling stomach. It wasn't long after that until I got sick. I was sick all night and only got about 3 hours of sleep. The next morning I felt a little bit better and got ready for work- since I am right out of college, every minute of work counts. I got to work at 8am and at around 9:30am my stomach started acting up and I had to leave work for the whole day. I am losing money on my next paycheck because of Cadillac Ranch. I believe they owe me a day's worth pay. I'm still only able to eat bland foods and now instead of getting together with friends tonight, I get to go home and sleep to get over this. Yay fun weekend for me.. not.  So take it from me- do not go to Cadillac Ranch for food unless you want food poisoning and your weekend to be ruined. I will not be returning anytime soon, if ever."
0,"I went here the other night and it was a fairly not awesome experience. We got there early, and there were only a few people working there. This resulted in us waiting quite a bit to be seated and to get service. We both got the make your own pasta and I got a side caesar salad. I had to wait with my salad for a long time because I didn't have a fork....pretty weird. I felt like I was in coming to America or something. The food was completely bland. I had a mix of arrabiata sauce and garlic...two strong flavors....yet it had no flavor. I just wish I remembered how much this place is not good before I decide to go there again."
0,"I love Jamba Juice. I hate Jamba attitude. \n\nJamba deserves 5 stars for its array of flavors, boosters and options for juice, smoothie, etc. Yet, when the manager stands there and patronizes you and seems to be annoyed that you want to cash in on a free 16 oz jamba juice (from a promo card that was a gift from another Jamba manager), then I have a problem. This Jamba is worthy of only 2 stars because, let's face it, the teens behind the counter know how to make a mean peanut butter moo'd smoothie and instruct you that the straw tends to get stuck to the bottom of the cup. So, instead of sucking up all the air in the room, you can dutifully swirl the yummy cup contents and exercise the straw enough until the Jamba froth touches your tongue. \n\nI'll definitely be going back for the peanut butter smoothie. I just won't be going back to this Jamba Juice."
1,"I love radish cake with egg, and they do not disappoint here. Beautifully crunchy on the outside, wonderfully creamy on the inside... goes well with some hot soy milk, sweetened with table sugar.  Also recommend their champion rice roll with spicy pickles. It's not too hot, just sour crunch with heat tempered with sweet pork fung."
1,Went outside my comfort zone and ordered bbq oysters and the Rockefeller oysters...both awesome but favored the bbq ones.. calamari was good not chewy.....my waiter was an older gentleman(James) and he was awesome also...most definitly coming back...\n***!!!!!!! They took the Bbq oysters off the menu :(
0,"Went there with my boyfriend...I ordered the BLT...I've had BETTER!  It tasted a little sour, like sourdough bread...I asked for white bread. Also, I asked for coleslaw as the side....got chips!  The server looked very bored and she was hovering...very annoying just so you know!  And please, get some sweet n low!  I will say this,  my boyfriend ordered the Cuban Panini and his was good.  Would I go back..maybe if it is busier so I don't feel like I am being watched and IF they get my order right."
1,"Tons of choices, many tasty options. Do NOT get the largest one. I ate it for three days and I'm a 200lb. male. Some employees don't speak English well, so brush up on your Spanish restaurant phrases before you go in."
1,"Holy cow, this was the fastest smog check I've ever done. It takes longer to fill up my gas than it took to get smogged here, no lie. They have 3 machines so the likelyness if having to wait is slim to none. \n\nI was there for about 4 minutes TOTAL and 2 of them was waiting for the machine to charge my card. The guy was super nice and friendly. They are at a new location which now has bathrooms. Apparently the previous location didn't. \n\nNot only do they give 90 days to rescan for free if needed but if you go on their website you can get a coupon (that you can just show them on your mobile) to bring the price down to $13.99!!! $19.99 regular price isn't bad either though. \n\nANYONE who needs a smog check needs to go here! No questions asked!"
0,"I'm not one to write reviews, I figure if I frequent enough it should always be the same or maybe better, not in this case.  I have been to both Hilldale and Monroe many times and usually always have the Huevos Racheros, and every time I get the same response to my asking for poached eggs, \""we don't make poached eggs here.\""  \n\n I don't have a problem if it's not listed on the menu * eggs made the way you like them*  Now, it's usually a hit or miss depending on the server, but this time just rubbed me the wrong way, and the way our server said, well you may have gotten them at another location but we don't serve poached eggs, we only have a grill here.\""  What, a kitchen doesn't have pots for boiling water?  \n\nThe food was great, service was lousy, and inconsistent, and if you put a statement on your menu ALL your locations should follow suit."
0,"I used to buy La Prima espresso for my Pavoni all the time so I was pretty excited to actually get a cup of coffee here.  I ordered a cappuccino.  It tasted like milk and no coffee.  I was exceptionally disappointed.  So while the place has a great reputation,  even they can screw it up if they don't pay attention to detail, and  at this level they should never screw it up. I had a better cup at Martys Market for crying out loud!"
1,"How have I not reviewed Edinburgh Castle yet, considering I see it every day, from several different angles? it's hard to miss as it sits atop its rough rocky hill, overlooking the city.\n\nI admit, as far as a visiting tourist attraction goes, the fee for admittance doesn't quite deliver the awe-inspiring wonder you would hope. But that comes for free, by simply seeing the Castle.\n\nWhether it's from turning off George Street onto Castle Street, and looking up to see, there, amidst the modern caf\u00e9s and shoe shops the ancient castle right in front of you.\n\nOr as you're walking around Arthur's Seat, and as you reach the top of a small hill and suddenly the city comes into view, there is Edinburgh stretched out in front of you with the Castle standing above it all in the sky line.\n\nOr if you're in the Old Town, at say Greyfriar's Bobby's graveyard. Amidst the gothic tombstones, the Castles towers over.\n\nAnd then there's wandering through the Grassmarket, with the wind and rain blowing in your face and you're swearing under your breath at it all, and then you see the rocky, almost sheer face of the hill with the Castle looming right above you, and you think \""wow. I'm living in a city that surrounds this awesome, giant, ancient Castle.\"" And I fall a little bit more in love with Edinburgh."
1,"I've been wanting to try Top Notch for a while, especially since it's a favorite of Shirley B.'s--that's all I needed to know, but it's also located in the same shopping plaza as my hairdresser - convenient!  So, after getting my hair did after work one night, I planned  a double date dinner with the b/f and two of my great friends here-all I had to do was walk next door.  For a Thursday night at 7:00pm, the place was deserted, which is surprising since the food and service is, yes, top notch.  I ordered the two-item combo: ribs and pulled pork with the mac n cheese and highly rated sweet potato casserole for my two sides.  The dinner also came with two pieces of Texas toast.  It was a heck of a lot of meat and what usually happens when I have BBQ happened again:  I ate up all the sides and had lots of BBQ left over.  The mac n cheese was great (I love the stuff too much) and the sweet potato casserole lives up to the hype.  The ribs are not the fall-off-the-bone type, which I prefer, but they were still tasty and the pulled pork was flavorful, as well.  Our server was friendly and attentive, but not hard to do when there really weren't too many customers in there.  That's a shame, though, because this place is legit.  Give it a try--Tita Shirley was right again!"
1,"In general, I am not a fan of Shadyside bars. Le Mardi Gras may be in Shadyside, but it is something else entirely.\n\nMardi Gras is a true dive bar, and not just compared to what's around it--this would be divey in any neighborhood. Drinks are cash only, there's a perpetual haze of smoke, and you'd better be an expert at navigating dim lighting if you hope to not trip over anyone. None are especially bad things. And in fact, the pros of Mardi Gras far outweigh these things. Great big booths, friendly bartenders, free wifi, and strong drinks.\n\nSpeaking of drinks: are you into fresh-squeezed juices? Do you like strong drinks? I mean really strong. Play it safe. Try a Greyhound, but make sure you have a designated driver. The bartenders almost take pride in the strength.\n\nAll in all, it's an authentic dive in a neighborhood that sorely needs one. Grab your cash, and bottoms up!"
0,"My friend's club promoter friend were able to get us into XS for free, and he also said he'd be able to hook us up with free drinks at Blush at 11pm so we dropped by here after we had already gotten admission into XS.\n\nBlush is called a \""boutique club\"" for a reason - it is on the smaller and more intimate side.  There's one long bar area and some booths with a very small dance floor.  The crowd here is mostly older - I saw A LOT of cougars on the prowl.\n\nAs for the free drinks, it wasn't quite what we expected.  We thought it was unlimited alcohol of any sort, but they were only offering free CHAMPAGNE to the women.  You had to get a wristband and be on the guestlist to get the champagne.  Eh, I guess champagne counts as alcohol, and nothing beats free.  This place definitely cannot compete with XS, which is just down the way in the same hotel (Encore)."
0,"We belonged to this church for several years. From our family's experience, all this church truly cared about was profit. Joe (the youth pastor) was very discouraging and at our time with the church, turned people away from God. He came across as very judgmental and uncaring. My advice is to try another church. It is also VERY hard to find a nitch in the church as it is incredibly large."

0,"I met the owner, Gary, when I showed up for my initial appt with SAM.  Sam didn't bother calling me to tell me that she wasn't going to show up, after I drove 40min to get there. I was furious. Gary was highly professional and helpful, and apologized for Sam's lack of basic professionalism.  \nAfter rescheduling the appt with Sam (against my better judgement), she cancelled on me AGAIN (only because I reached out to her first the day of to confirm).  I cannot understand how you run a business this way.  Perhaps she's a good stylist, but I cannot continue to waste my time with someone who doesn't respect my time. \n\nGary seems like a very good guy; I hope for the sake of his salon that he only contracts with legitimate, professional stylists, because ultimately it's his salon that suffers."
0,"The place stinks of smoke like when it was the Imperial. The rooms are tiny. The WIFI works about half the time or less. The casino area is small, the only saving grace is the staff are attentive.\nThe bars and restaurants on the walk way are all nice."
1,"Its ok. Its an airport, and a stereotypical one at that. It has long lines and a lot of traffic, expensive chain restaurants, and shops. Nothing special. Customer Service is passable and they do a good job as expected, however it is a typical airport. No muss or fuss."

1,"I have an on again off again relationship with Trader Joe's... I love it one day and hate it the next... mostly, I've hated it only a couple of times when I bought a bunch of fresh produce and then waited a day or two too long to eat the stuff and by then, it was bad.  \n\nBut, Jared's been getting amazing salmon at this location over the last few months, so I am back on with TJ's at the moment...\n\nWe went in to this location today to stock up the fridge, and $83 later, we came out with 5 bags (eco-friendly Yelp bags no less) filled with healthy grub for the week.  Well, most of it was healthy!  There is always interesting unique foods at TJ's which keeps shopping fun - we went for a few new products from the frozen section on this trip including a curried rice dish called Biryani, frozen grilled eggplant and zucchini, and vegetable shu mai.  I also saw that they have mochi which I love and will likely purchase on a future visit.\n\nWe made the pecan-crusted salmon for dinner tonight, along with some fresh veggies and rice, and it was delicious!  \n\nSo, thanks Trader Joe's for all of the goodness that will be fueling me this week... as long as I find no mold or rotten bananas, I'll be back again to see you soon!"
0,"Well, first off I did not know what kind of place this was when I went in. We thought the name looked cool, and the place is new. Turns out it is kind of a \""Hooters\"" with Scottish theme. So all the waitresses are young women wearing outfits that cover as little skin as possible.\n\nThe place is not very family friendly in my opinion. Totally a place for guys who think waitresses in low cut bras are a necessary thing.\n\nApart from that, the food was a bit over priced for what you got. My \""Fish and Chips\"" had cold/room temp fries. And it was nothing special in terms of quality.\n\nNeedless to say, I won't be eating there again. Not really into the ogling ladies in public while eating average food thing."
1,"Bally's was my home away from home when I spent five days in Sin City. Though it is one of the older hotels on the strip, I didn't mind cause our room was in the newer north tower. Upon checking in, we pulled some strings (think $) and got upgraded to a suite on the Diamond floor, which is for their Diamond members. I'm not quite sure why they call it a suite because it is just a bigger room. I didn't complain because there was plenty of room for the four of us. They even gave us extra room keys and rolled in a fridge for us. Not bad for $185.\n\nI don't recommend gambling at this casino. My luck was terrible at Bally's; take the short walk over to Paris instead. Newer machines and nicer dealers. \n\nLast but not least, don't forget to check out the Tequila Bar downstairs!! You won't be disappointed, especially after a long night. Trust me :)"
1,"Came here for dinner with some friends. We had 6 people and the waitress was very accommodating.\n\nVery, very tasty pizza. I had the Montreal, which was their pepperoni, mushroom, and pepper pizza. Not sure why it's called that, but it was awesome. \n\nRecommended."
0,"Zushi has had quite a few ups and downs. Unfortunately they are very hit and miss. One thing I have noticed since new ownership has taken over is that they have a few new rolls. But the rolls aren't rolled tight and the fish isn't quite cut properly.\nI do love the atmosphere, especially sitting outside on the comfortable seats near the fire. But its just not all that great!"
1,"Great place.  Fun ambiance...they had a movie on in the background when we were there.  Great pizza and bruschetta.  The Bocca Trio was definitely better than the Porco pizza.  Service was excellent.  The only reason this doesn't get 5 stars is the price ... it's hard for me to justify paying so much at a pizza place.  Will return, especially if they lower their prices a tad.  Maybe I'll just stick to Happy Hour.  :-)"
1,"What a find! Especially for a New Yorker, with no dining spot like this back home (but see below). Luckily, it's near the Airport, so it makes a great place to have your first and/or last meal on a trip to Phoenix.\n\nPasties are tasty meat or vegetable pies meant to be lowered to hungry miners in Cornwall. Fortunately for us, someone thought of  bringing them to the US, and particularly to the Phoenix area. I had the Lamb Vindaloo (probably not an import from Cornwall), and my brother had the Balsamic Portabello. Both were delicious; the Vindaloo was spicy, but not too spicy. Go ahead and order it - you won't be sorry.  Since this was sort of dinner, we then shared the Pilgrim, which incorporated turkey, sweet potatoes, stuffing and a side of cranberry sauce. This was OK, but could have used more turkey, and less stuffing. Pies ranged from $6.50-9.00.\n\nExcellent selection of European draft beers in 14, 20, and 34 ounce mugs, the largest being a mere $8-9 bucks. Also many imported premium bottles, plus Tempe's own Four Peaks Kilt Lifter (6%) for only $3.50. What a deal.\n\nFor other New Yorkers reading this, I understand Myers of Keswick, a shop on Hudson Street, has Cornish Pasties and other meat pies. They're generally less than $4.00, so probably smaller and for takeout only. I'll give you an update on this next time I'm down in the Village."
1,"It takes a lot to impress me.  I hate most everything unless a place is so awesome it blows my friggin' head off.  Sign of the whale accomplished this task.  Allow me to elaborate...\n\nThe first time I went here, I received awesome service.  Did not have a bad thing to say about the place.  Was waiting for my party to arrive and sat by myself.  The bartender was awesome, started bullshitting with me and making me feel more than welcome.  The owner is always walking around the place, making sure things are cool with ALL of his customers.  Seriously, all of them.  The guy kind of reminded me of Eugene Levy from the original vacation movie.  I almost expected him to try and sell me a Metallic P.  Anyway, the guy was cool as hell.  Making sure everything was good with our food and drinks.\n\nNow the drinks... Wow.  They don't cheap out on the pour with these bastards, and they are not overpriced for what you get.  I have no complaints about the strength of these things, and that is always my first test if a bar is worth a shit.  if you own a bar and I have talked shit about the strength of your drinks, I invite you to go to sign of the whale.  I practically challenge you, like we should meet at the flag pole after school challenge you.  Let them show you what having a dick is like and how a drink should poured.    I hooked the bartender up on the tip, he deserved it.  I would go as far to say that I would almost take a bullet for that guy.  If I had a vagina, I would probably offer to father his children.  Well, that isn't true.  If I had a vagina, I would spend all day looking at it in the mirrior, but you understand what I am getting at.  You are as sexy as a Ferrari, good sir.\n\nThe food...  Damn.  Goddamn.  Who the hell is the cook there, Emeril?Only had appetizers because they were on the cheap but between three of us we had 4 orders of appetizers and left full.  And I am fat.  Not quite Paul Blart Mall cop, but more of a Corey Haim 2007 era. \n\nRegardless, want a great place without giving you any shit and keeping you drunk for less, hit this place up.  It is like a high priced hooker for half off, you can't go wrong.  The only gripe I have about this place is they seem to be a Green Bay Fudgepackers bar, but I guess no one is perfect!\n\nHit this bitch up."
0,"This is one hotel that will not be on my favorite list. It's definitely a hotel for a very young crowd. When walking to my room I noticed a mattress outside one of the rooms which screamed tacky. The next day when leaving my hotel room to grab lunch downstairs, I noticed a bunch of trays with breakfast food and late night snacks lying on the floor (and it stayed there well into the afternoon). I immediately realized that positive first impressions were not this hotel's number one priority for its customers. I would only recommend this hotel to a 20 something crowd looking for a serious place to party."
1,"Just a few doors down from my work sits a small, unassuming cafe. \n\nFrom the footpath, all that indicates it's there is the all too familiar 'Illy' coffee sign that protrudes from and adorns many good coffee houses...and yes, this is a good one!\n\nMy review in this instance focuses on 2 elements; the ability of the staff to produce a good, consistent flat white and the friendliness and attentiveness of said staff. I'm pleased to announce that on both fronts, I cannot fault...excellent in fact. \n\nYes I have rated 4 rather than 5 stars, but this is purely on the fact that I've only ordered coffees to date...but have made a pact with myself to venture past beverages and finally have lunch there, so I hope 5 stars are a'coming!"
1,"This is a great Chinese food place - I recommend it.  \n\nThere are many different tasty dishes to choose from.  It's operated with good service and modest prices too, so it makes for a great dining experience. ;)"
1,"Awesome place. Cheap entertainment.\n\nNot sure why it took me so long to check this place out. I was only there for a few minutes, killing time before heading to the Thomas & Mack for the Rodeo. I put 50c into a Star Wars pinball machine and played the 3 balls. I then put $1 into a TMNT machine and got a lot more plays than I thought I was supposed to. It made me think, \""Maybe I left some credit on the Star Wars machine.\"" Sure enough, I went back to it and it had a few more credits left to use.\n\nThe point of that ramble is this: Your quarters go a long way here. I definitely have to come back. I didn't get to walk around the whole place and check out every row. As others have said, this place is truly a hidden gem."
1,"Woooohooo! We finally got a Hobby Lobby on this side of town! I used to have to drive 50 miles round trip to go to the Henderson location.\n\nThis store is huge and is very cleaned and well stocked.\n\nIf you sign up for their e-club they send you a 40% off coupon or current promotion. I often pull up hobby lobby on my smart phone and just show the 40% coupon and they take it with no problem.\n\nI just signed up for the Wilton cake decorating class and couldn't be more excited. They have a separate classroom for the several classes they do offer. You can go to their website and look up the class schedule to see what they offer and the dates for them. They offer great discounts at times on them. The cake decorating class I signed up for is usually $45 but I got it for a total of $20.50.\n\nThe name says it all. \""Hobby Lobby\"" has all your *hobby* needs! They have a great scrap-booking section with the best stickers.\n\nIf you are a crafter you need to check this place out!!! They have the cutest home decor too."
0,"So I went here twice on my last trip to Vegas and that's only because I was on a budget and a promoter set me up. My first impression was that the club was very classy. I love the decorations. Oh and the DJ is awesome, great music. Other than that I was not impressed. A lot of the staff is so rude. Not everyone, but a large majority. Also, this club seems to have a stuck up clientele who thinks they're so much better than everyone else. News flash: you're not. Another thing I didn't like is that there is no where to sit unless you want to spend a whole lot on bottle service. Like even the tables that no one was buying bottles at they yell at you and tell you to move or buy a bottle. Oh and the girl working at the coat check pissed me off. My boyfriend is a type 1 diabetic so he frequently has to check his blood sugars and he was keeping his test kit in his coat. It's $5 for coat check and he gave her a nice tip but when he went back to get his test kit she made him check out his coat and pay to check it back in. WTF?! I will never go back here. There are much better clubs in town and better prices. Do not be fooled by promoters or the fact that this place is at the Bellagio! Do your research and go to a better club. Unless you're a stuck up prick you won't have a good time."
1,"Tammi Musemicu was awesome! Been looking for a good hair stylist and I think I just found one. My husband and son have been going to her for some time now but cutting women's hair is different than guys, anyways she did a fabulous job. I only did 4 stars but I will review again after color. :)"
0,"Please do not categorize yourself under Mexican food, your just giving it a bad name. The food is absolutely not authentic or maybe the times that I've gone the person cooking wasn't the same as in these other reviews. \n\nIn some of my other reviews I've talked about what to look for before ordering. Well if they offer you free chips and salsa and the chips are hard and stale. Pay for your drink and run out of the door like now! \n\nJust try some of the other smaller businesses around you might find something way better."
0,I rather pay more and go to Target than ever go into this place again. They have a ton of registers and hardly any cashiers. The one time I went in it took me 30 minutes to pay. It was 2am and the line was super long. The cashier had no problem taking a bathroom break and never called anyone to cover the line. Another time the clerk was actually arguing with a customer using profanity and being confrontational.  I've never seen anything like it. Stay away!
0,"I've heard excellent things about this place and overall enjoyed the yelp event here but my personal experience just didn't live up too much.\n\nI ordered the Spicy Seafood Fettucine. I asked whether they made their pasta in-house and was told the only one they do not make is the fettucine so I asked if I could get Papperadelle instead- and was told that wouldn't be a problem.\n\nMy dish came out very luke warm. The homemade pasta was a bit too thick and starchy (papp. should be wide but not necessarily thick). The sauce had no spiciness whatsoever and the sausage was more like 4-5 sausage crumbles (come on your pasta dish is $19). The shrimp were way over cooked and the mussels were  lackluster. The one highlight of the dish was the one sea scallop which was perfectly seared and flavorful....it was big but since there was only one scallop it wasn't enough to save the dish. The scallop was hot so I am assuming my pasta sat around until that was ready hence the reason for the very low temp.\n\nI attempted to order a side Caesar with this but the server was extremely hesitant to recommend it so I opted out. One of my friends had the small plate (butter poached scallop) and that was delicious. Another had the Du jour vegetarian plate which was a smoked grits with veggies- and I wasn't overly impressed. We also tried the beet ravioli which my friend raved about last time but this time she said it was different- and honestly it was downright gross, had that have been my meal it would have been returned. The ravioli had been cooked to a mush -completely unappetizing. \n\nThe absolute only reason I would return is our server. He was beyond friendly- and helpful. I do doubt however, it will be anytime soon."
0,"Went in for a meal and a pint with my wife. After reading the menu and then going to the bar to order, was ignored by the bar man (smarmy git with a wannabe beard and fake posh boy english accent) several times. I was clearly in his eye sight, made eye contact with him and he continued to serve others. As I stepped right up to the bar he made it obvious that he wouldn't serve me. So after a couple more minutes and a fellow patron asking me if I wanted to move even closer to get noticed, I decided to take my business elsewhere. Very disappointed and hopefully the plant pot of a bar man gets his cards sooner or later. Idiot!!"
0,"The Plus: If you check in on Yelp you receive 6 free garlic knots. The garlic knots have a nice crust on the outside and a doughy center. I enjoyed these.\n\nI ordered the Stromboli and it was pretty good. I told the server light cheese. I would have wished that the center of the Stromboli would have been hotter though. They could have left it in the oven for another few minutes.\n\nThe Not So Plus: The tables, menus...the restaurant...could use some cleaning. One menu on the table had a glob of marinara sauce on it. The other card stock menu on the table was pretty worn and dirty as well. \n\nThe service was just okay. All in all, I don't see myself returning to this restaurant."
0,"Talk about COLD.  2 stars.\n\nThis was one of the worst Cold Stone's I've been to.  I stopped coming to Cold Stone a long time ago because the ice cream is just way too overpriced for your serving.  At our wedding we had a 'mock' Cold Stone station setup, and it cost us less per person and tasted just as good.  Plus it was all-you-can-eat!  I rock the buffet that way, even at me own wedding.  We are in Las Vegas after all.\n\nThe store was super busy I'm guessing because it was a hot summer night.  Line was nearly out the door.  The wait was just too long, and they had four people behind the counter taking orders and 'creating' ice cream treats.  It took a good 20 minutes to finally reach the front where someone would finally greet us.\n\nDid I mention the inside of the store was HOT?  Like damn, it's an ice creamery, is your AC not on?  Fans were going but it felt like warm air was circulating the entire place.  Only place that looked cool was inside the actual ice cream coolers.  Surprisingly and thankfully the ice cream wasn't melting on us.\n\nIt was a while since we'd been there so our order consisted of something the three of us (Wifey, lil' one, and I) could share.  We stuck with a Love It size (their largest) of one of Cold Stone's signature creations, the Strawberry Banana Rendezvous.  Sounds sexy...but well, it wasn't.  Lactose Viagra couldn't help this flavor get it on.\n\nWhy was this flavor so flaccid you ask?  Lets start with our Cold Stone flavor creator.  Our person was obviously new because when we placed our order, she had NO clue how to make it.  She constantly looked over our shoulder at the signature menu to find the ingredients.  No big deal I say.  Here's where it gets silly.  She starts with the strawberry ice cream base, adds a little serving of graham cracker pie crust, and literally (LITERALLY) two small strawberries.  She screws up and adds regular chocolate chips instead of the required WHITE chocolate chips.  I mention her mistake and she apologizes.  I tell her nevermind we've been waiting in line too long so she can just proceed.  She runs to the back, gets a SUPER GREEN banana and continues to cut it into chunks in front of us and add it to our creation.  I had to stop her there.  \n\n\""Miss, you realize that you are putting an under ripe green banana into our ice cream.\""\n\n\""Sorry, I don't eat bananas so I don't know how they taste.\""\n\nHoly $h!+balls....are you serious?  Don't eat bananas?  Have you even eaten Cold Stone ice cream?  Pretty sure they should teach you how to create items and how they should taste.  At this point I'm near fuming.  She takes out the green banana from our ice cream, looks for a less green banana (the one she finds still has a hint of green), cuts it up and puts it back in our ice cream.  Now the ice cream is melting thanks to it sitting on the marble too long in a warm room.  She finishes mashing our creation together and puts it in a cup.\n\nI'm at the counter and our Strawberry Banana Rendezvous is turning into a milkshake.  I look in disgust and pay the lady.  Nearly $8!  8 friggin' dollars!  No wonder half these places closed down when the economy turned sour, total luxury buy.  I'm better off going to Albertson's when Blue Bell goes on sale for $4 a half gallon.\n\nWe get outside to sit and eat our 'creation'.  For three people, it was hardly shareable.  There just wasn't much ice cream even in its largest sized cup.  I could have eaten the 'Love It' size by myself.  Tasty?  I think not!  Strawberry Banana Rendezvous left me hangin'.  Ice cream was runny, graham cracker crust got soggy, dark chocolate chips didn't match well.  Strawberry pieces were SOUR!  I hate that.  Hate it.  Banana?  Not.  Sweet.  At. All.  In fact, our ice cream had a tinge of that under ripe bitter banana taste to it because of the green banana our person put in our ice cream before she fished it back out.  I finished the last of it just so we didn't have to take it home. \n\nUtter and total disappointment.  Waste of time and money this go round.\n\nFrom now on I will go back to the freezer section and choose from the hundreds of better tasting ice cream available to me for an even better bargain.  Experience at Cold Stone Creamery has left me frozen.  Frozen?  Frozen."
0,People who work there are full of attitude.\n\nFood is tasteless\n\nIce tea has no flavor\n\nNo point to the place
1,"This is definitely fine dining.  The food is very good; I had the filet mignon and tasted  Jenny's mashed potatoes (a must!) and creamed spinach.  I enjoyed every bite.  The service is great; our server was well versed on the menu, which was helpful.  We split the birthday brownie sundae for dessert and it didn't disappoint.  If you have the extra money and want to enjoy a relaxing atmosphere with great food, give Joe's a shot."
1,"My Wife and I have been here several times.\nOne time, the service was terrible.\nThe rest of the times, though, have been great.\n\nIf you sign up on their email list they'll send you lots and lots of deals.\n\nThe sushi is tasty.  I'm a huge fan of their specialty rolls.\nThey also have great happy hour specials:\nMon-Fri, 3pm-7pm\nMon-Sat, 10pm-Close\nSun, 8pm-Close\n\nFinally, I really like how you can call ahead to put your name on the list, as it tends to get pretty busy.  \n\nOverall, if you're looking for some good sushi, I'd say give RA Sushi a try!\nEnjoy!"

0,"The Phoenix airport experience is horrendous. This is my second time this year and likely my last. Understaffed, one person checking in cars at 6:30am, aloof indifferent staff. Awful. I get stressed each time I rent there. I won't put up with it anymore."
0,"MB has a so-so buffet. Most of their points come from the decor alone--beautiful tropical outdoor setting to look out to. The selection is poor.  Too few food, too little desserts. Quality of the food is just meh. Certainly no where near what it costs. Excalibur, much cheaper and lower rated, tastes better. I agree that I would rather go to Mcds than Bayside. And I love MB as a hotel and casino. This is sad."
0,"Maybe it's just me but this store is not up to par in my opinion. I always stop here to get money orders for rent on the way home from work and I almost always have to wait at the counter for 5 or more minutes while employees constantly yell \""someone will be right with you\"" at me from all directions. The sandwich counter is good although it says sandwich in 3 minutes or its free and it always takes longer. (I never say anything because I don't care, I just don't see the point of the sign.) Their meat section is a joke lacking any real selection. The produce is almost always below my quality standards and is also lacking in selection. Last but most definitely not least they always have just one register open and no self checkout. Overall going there is a highly inconveniencing experience and I would not recommend going there for anything."
1,"I love the fact that they serve dim sum for lunch and dinner, cause who wakes up early enough for breakfast dim sum in Las Vegas? Dim sum was delicious by the way, we tried the chicken chow mein lunch special and it was awesome. The service was ok, come on it's a Chinese restaurant, you expect bad service and no smiles, it's just the way it is. I really do like this place and I'm a bit sad about the other reviews, but I will still make my way here when I'm in LV."
1,One of my favorite spots in LV!! Ya gotta try it at least once!
0,"Cute restaurant, food mediocre and not authentic.\n\nI guess this place caters to gringo palates. We ordered samosas which were pretty good. the naan was a bit lacking in flavor. Myself and a companion who were familiar with Indian cuisine ordered the matar paneer and vegetable kofta. Food wasn't bad, but lacking in spice and deep traditional indian flavor. This was disappointing as we had specifically requested that our food be very spicy. The rest of our party ordered lamb korma and chicken tikka masala and were generally pleased as they liked their food on the milder side.\n\nThe owner (who acted as our waiter) was stingy with the rice. He brought us one bowl for five people and gaped at us when we asked for more, mid dinner service. Not that we were being greedy, but this was like the size of a cereal bowl. (when most indian restaurants will give you a serving bowl) He then proceeded to bring us  half a cereal bowl full of rice then said, \""ok guys this is all we have.\"" --REALLY.\n\nHe then paced around the restaurant then glared at us until we left.\nI understand that we came about an hour before closing, which can be annoying for most restaurant staff, but there were also two other couples dining. Way to get your message across. I get it, you want us to get the f*ck out. Noted.\n\nSo we quickly finished and left. Needless to say I will not be returning. I've had better Indian Food in the backwoods of North Carolina. \n\nService  was fast, food is ok in a pinch if you're desperate. But for me, Indian Curry Bowl is to Indian food as Taco Bell is to Mexican food."
0,"I'd give this place .5 star if I could.  Waited 45 minutes for a table last night - ok so we killed some time in the casino as we waited. Pan seared potstickers were served cold, told the waiter, waited for a 2nd serving, they were cold too.  Famous rice and chicken soup barely had any chicken in it at all.  Spicy ahi roll should be named NO spicy ahi, tons of rice roll - awful!  Sizzling surf and turf platter was very salty.  All in all very, very disappointing.  I've eaten lunch a the Ling and Louie's in the DFW airport it was 1000x better than thisl  Terrible and we will not go back!  How can you serve cold potstickers twice and not have a manager come by to apologize. Awful food, awful experience. I don't think anyone that works in this location cares about anything - not the food, not the customers, not the dining experience...someone better wake up and fix this place or it will not survive - and maybe that's a good thing."
1,This restaurant is a must try. We wandered on sainte Catherine and because of the yelp review we stumbled upon this hidden gem. At first we were hesitant to stay but it was worth the stay. I got the lemon buttered veal with fettucine Alfredo it was really good. Another member in out party got the chicken Alfredo with mushroom. wow this dish changed my mind to give a 4 to a 5. This is a must try dish and i will recommend every one to try this restaurant.
1,"A few years ago, I went to Dolce Lusso for a special updo for a friend's wedding, and they did an awful job.  I thought I'd never go back.  That is, until I ran into a woman who had the exact, elusive color of red that I'd been striving for for years.  She said, go see Richie Childers at Dolce Lusso.  So I did.  And, boy am I glad I did!\n\nI met Richie one afternoon for a consultation, during which I lamented my many failed attempts to achieve the vibrant, cherry coke red I desired for my baby fine, ashy-brown hair.  Every stylist before had said they'd gotten it as red as possible without bleaching my hair out first (something I did not want to do).  Each time, it looked great the day I was colored, but each day after that, it quickly faded to blah.  And you could never see the red unless I was in sunlight.  Richie explained to me why my desired color could not work at salons that carried such products as Redkin and such, and explained why the Aveda colors, and his techniques, would get me the results I wanted.  No problem.\n\nSo, I put myself in his hands.  I was not disappointed.  My color was absolutely gorgeous, and exactly what I had wanted all those years.  So vibrant and shiny, too!  My color stayed that way until about week five, when it ever-so-slightly began to fade a little bit. Richie had warned me that would happen this time because he had had to lift a little of my color and apply a particular technique this first time I saw him, but that subsequent applications would result in longer-lasting color.  So, no problem.  Week six, I saw Richie again.  This time, he adjusted the color application, only laying on color.  I could not believe the results!  Even more red, rich, vibrant, shiny--just gorgeous!  No fewer than four total strangers stopped me during that day, commenting on my gorgeous red hair.  I love it!\n\nFYI, for all of you who say Dolce Lusso charges too much, considering they aren't a Charlotte salon--I've been to many Charlotte salons, and I never escape without forking over at least $200.  Richie is one of their top stylists, and each of my visits was under $200.  Considering it's the best service with the best results, I'd have happily paid more.\n\nRichie, I'm all yours now.  And I'm hooked on the Aveda color and your techniques.\n\nBonus: They have these incredibly comfortable reclining seats at the hair washing stations.  You're fully reclined, and there's even a built-in massage.  Heaven!"

1,I have finally found the perfect coffee and dessert place in Vegas!! It's open late night until three and it's a great place to study with couches and no loud music. The whole lay out of the place is cute and has a calm feel. They have random antiques and these cute Ivey plants everywhere that they were growing. I ordered just the honey toast because I just ate at naked fish. WOW! That honey toast was the best I had in Vegas so far. It's so soft and fluffy on the inside and nice and crispy on the outside! Just how it should be. It was topped with two scoops of ice cream and whip cream. I think the scoops should be a little bigger since the honey toast was pretty decent sized. But overall I love here! Definitely coming back here to try their drinks!
0,"If I could give them a zero, I would. My neighbors were using Atlas to manage their property, as they lived out of state. \nAtlas supposedly screens tenants with a background/credit/criminal history check before leasing the property. However, the tenants they let move into my neighbors house were convicted felons - one was incarcerated on the move-in day! Neither of them even had JOBS!\nIt took me one google search to find their colorful criminal history.\nIt took the property owners months to get them out of their home. \nThey were violent, filthy meth-heads and I was so disappointed that Atlas would move those kind of folks into our neighborhood.\nThe tenants also did a lot of damage to the home in the 6 months they were there. At one point, they had NINE pitbulls living in the home.\nThis was in an upscale, gated community.\nNeedless to say, my neighbors fired Atlas after this mess.\nI would steer clear of this company - unless you want your house destroyed."
1,Some place warm. A place where the beer flows like wine. Where beautiful women instinctively flock like the salmon of Capistrano. I'm talkin about a little place called Poppys.
0,"I have gone to this place for years and USED to really love it.  I still love the atmosphere, but the food has gone WAY down hill.  If your looking for great decor, friendly staff and poor food this is your place.\n\nSeems that they are resting on their fame now only."
1,I love this place....the staff is very had working.  Prices are great and food is wonderful.  Love the green chili chicken burro enchilada style...doesn't get better than that.  Best bet is to get it to go and have it with your own beer.
0,Wings were delicious at the moment but I ended up getting killer food poisoning and was horribly sick the day after.
1,"The food was great, atmo was awesome and the staff was super nice but... I'm not much of a meat eater and there weren't many options for me.  All the pasta had some form or pork or red meat and most all the vegetarian dishes were really carbie.   It's a great spot but not vegetarian or gluten free friendly"
0,"In a word: Yuck.  \n\nGot a Groupon for this place (Lunch for 2 for $28, I think?). Was hesitant after reading some extremely mixed reviews but figured, why not?\n\nWe came for lunch on Black Friday around 1:30, without a reservation, and though the restaurant was only about half full we had to wait for 10-15 minutes before being seated.  Our server, Kelly?, introduced herself and seemed nice enough, but seemed to forget about us throughout the rest of the meal and our bill was ALL sorts of messed up! She tried to charge to charge me TWICE for a $10 drink (Honey, I had one, it was disgusting, it took 20 minutes for you to bring it to me in the first place...and I wonder how many other 'drunk' customers you tried to pull that crap on).\n\nAdditionally, there was some sort of $18 additional fee for using the Groupon...wait what?! ....so in reality, it was $28 + the $18 fee the restaurant charges...oh yeah, and water (flat OR sparkling) is $6 a bottle...so bare minimum, lunch actually came to $58 plus tax and tip...and believe me that did not in any way reflect the quality of the meal.\n\nYeah, it was a 'surf & turf' all you can eat kind a thing, but Eeeeeesh, gross me out! The salad bar reminded me of the kind of $10 buffet you find in one of the area discount  casino/hotels, and I would say 9 out of 10 of the cuts of meat that were brought to the table were either grossly overcooked or raw. Plus, they brought around the bacon wrapped chicken, and some sort of sausage thing (read: the cheap stuff!) to the table at least 3-4 times each, but only ONCE, in the entire hour and half, brought around Picanha (steak)...and the slab they cut off for us was still bleeding.\n\nUgh, could not get out of there fast enough.  Will NEVER be back."
1,"I don't believe I've ever eaten better pizza.  Brutta's got absolutely amazing wood-fired crust, unbelievable sauce and the freshest, best toppings you can find.\n\nThe atmosphere is pretty good, too. I love the giant brick oven just behind the register, the pictures on the walls, the big windows facing Monroe Street and the cozy space.\n\nI don't recommend going on an empty stomach, however. The pizzas are smallish and thin, and they'll put a dent in your wallet, for sure. But for the best pizza ever? I've gotta give 5 stars."
1,"Had the famous Mac and cheese \""lunch portion\"" thank goodness....it was definitely more then enough."
0,Sucks! Seriously they take cc thru the drive thru but not inside! Wth!!! There is absolutely no logic in that so after I ordered and tried to pay I was refused (even though I go thru the drive thru all the time! So I pointed out there was no signs anywhere saying that and they still refused. So I took my crew down to the one on boulder highway (where we ordered the same thing and it was cheaper) and paid inside with a card!
1,"I've been back to see Li'l Kim several times -- happy happy happy! While she was on vacation, I saw Lisa. She is very, very good, too. I am definitely a \""regular\"" at Polished. Darn good salon!"
0,"This place did not impress me at all. The food was mediocre at best and expensive, service was horrible, much better food at Taco Bell. \n\nThe waiter was nowhere to be found most of the evening, when he brought the checks they were doubled up in the Folios with no explanation. \n\nWhen the waiter returned the checks for credit card signatures he dropped them in a big pile and left. \n\nWe approached the Manager to discuss the service, he was very indignant and made us feel as if they were doing us a favor by allowing us to visit their establishment. \n\nDefinitely would not recommend this restaurant unless you value poor service, high prices and mediocre food. \n\nI will definitely never eat at this restaurant ever again."
1,"So my friend from school told me about this place. Pretty amazing groomers. Ask for Rachel. She is so awesome. The price is better than any Pet Smart and your animal will not shriek in terror while there. They have Groupon discounts if you are on a budget. They also have self-service washing. Pretty neat. Also, so many foods, treats, goodies, toys, harnesses, etc for your pet that you will be amazed. I have never seen my dog's hair cut so well and she was absolutely in love with Rachel. The best price with the best service I have ever bought for my pet. Love it and highly recommend anyone to bring their pet here."
1,"Very busy restaurant/sports bar that surprised me with its quality.\n\nIt's a lot bigger than it looks from the outside, as it snakes inside a long ways.  Waiters are friendly and bartenders very nice eye-candy.  The burger selection isn't endless, but the handful of choices you have all appear quality.  \n\nSome burger choices are Kobe beef, lamb, veggie, followed by choices in bread, cheese, and a lot of other toppings.\n\nI ordered a veggie burger with avocado and sprouts on whole wheat.  It comes as a double veggie patty, which I didn't realize.  It was good, but from the description, I expected a little more flavor (more spiciness, specifically).  In any case, I really like the value.  It's a pricey burger but not extravagantly so, and you're full at the end.  \n\nThey have about four or five styles of fries:  the sweet potato-style is a tasty, less salty-tasting, alternative.\n\nI'd go back, as the other burgers ordered at the party looked really good."
0,"Beware! Shady practices if you use a debit card. I booked a room via hotels.com and prepaid the entire room. Upon checkin using a debit card they placed a hold for $260 on my card. Fine. All i should end up paying is the resort fees of $56. I checkout they charge my card for the entire $260! Why when all i owe them is $56 dollars?? Then two days later i call them and they tell me they issued a refund of the remaining amount. My bank which reflects things immediately if they are pending, shows nothing. They tell me it takes 3-7 days to show (BS). If they issued a credit back to my bank it would show pending in my account. I think they take the money hang on to it (as part of the bigger MGM portfolio) make money off it before returning it to the guest (i still have not received my refund and will be shortly filing a complaint in a few days with my bank if they do not return my funds). \n\nThis is a hotel owned by the entire MGM hotels group and im sure all their hotels do this. Im not paying them to stay at their resort to fund their venture capitalist division. Will no longer stay at one of this chain's hotel."
1,"This buffet is NOT for everyone.\n\nPeople who dines here must appreciate quality and overall value.  The foods prepared at this establishment are cooked to perfection and the waiting staff provided special attention to your every need.  At $62 per person (Memorial Day weekend), one must consider carefully before pulling the trigger.\n\nThe Wynn's buffet has been tops, but they now have a true rival.  May the two of these buffet battle it out for top honors."
0,Simple review:  the food and service are good if you don't mind smelling like an ashtray after.  I can't go for lunch because I can't stand smelling like that all day.  \n\nI can't believe this place gets by with allowing smoking considering how much food they seem to serve.
0,"I bought my vehicle 6 years ago that only has 29k miles. I have seen this facility go downhill in service since the new bldg. and location. The old and tired service advisors are not into their job and have no control over their work teams. I always use to drive out of my way for their service, but no more. I will take my money somewhere else where i can get service done."
0,This restaurant should be rated $$$$.   $7 for one taco at lunch time with no side(s)?  I think not; I walked out after seeing the prices.  I wasn't prepared to pay $30 for a mexican lunch for one.
0,"The interior is gorgeous; a high-ceilinged church with the stained glass and mason work in tact. However, the hummus was just average and both of our side order of fries were SO salty that it honestly made our mouths wrinkly like when you swim in the ocean for an hour; disgusting.\n\nI had the pulled pork and it was dry, so either it was not slow cooked or it was slow cooked and sat as the juices evaporated around it.\n\nIt's a shame that such a cool building has such crappy food. Since it's a brewery I kept feeling like they should serve German delicacies but the menu is a hodge podge of pseudo pub food and not very good. A shame."
1,The first time I came here Maddy was at the front desk. I came here 20 mins before a class starting. She talked to me explaining to me it's a cross between high impact aerobics meets yoga meets Pilates meets ballet. Well with 20 mins to spare I bought an outfit (because I thought this was a juice bar) and I dove in with my two feet! Well....half way in class yes I did want to have a heart attack but I got through. \n\nI have a medical condition and all the instructors here will help you and make it work for you! They motivate you and make sure you get through each class. After three classes I saw immediate results. Everyone here is so nice and welcoming. If they don't know you they will ask you your name and will remember it! \n\nThey have a great selection of workout clothes!!! Trust me lots of money has been spent here! They sell the most delicious smelling candles and adorable bracelets! \n\nIf you're looking for a new workout look no further! All the girls of PBC will welcome you here
0,"This place is gross. I would rather go to in-n-out burgers behind the casino. Or better yet, they have a little food court w/McDonalds really close to the entrance of the buffet. Just go there and get way better food for half the price. Everything is bland, everything is cheap. I also felt very dirty afterwards."
0,"I went in for a tooth cleaning. They told me they had to do some \""medically necessary work.\"" Not being a dentist I trusted them. I told them that I absolutely could not pay for it unless insurance covered it. They assured me it did. I had them double check to be sure, again they assured me. I went home and researched what they were going to do. Finding online that it might not be medically necessary I called back to cancel my appointment. Dr. Warren got on the phone and assured me it absolutely had to be done. I went forward with the work. After it was all done, I found out they had not done their due diligence in talking to my insurance--it was not covered. I was able to scrape the money together to pay them. I was upset and paid in all $1 bills. When I went in to pay I was informed I was the third person to pay that way that day (shouldn't that tell you something?). I am seeing a new dentist now who I enjoy much more. He also told me what Dr. Warren told me was incorrect and the procedure was not medically necessary, just an up-sale. Never going back."
0,"So let's get this out of the way up front: The food here's pretty good. There I said it. I always enjoy the food, there's not been one thing there that I've eaten that I didn't like. That being said, food isn't going to make me return to a place to eat. We usually get takeout from CB because their service flat out sucks. My wife made me go with her this past weekend, because I've been making her get takeout form Hula Modern Tiki the past few times (Hula's great). So against my will, and because it was on the eve of Valentine's day, I decided to cave against my better judgement. I should be totally ticked, but because they didn't fail my expectations and screwed up my meal/deliviered craptacular service, wifey won't be making me go again. Win, I think.  I always make it a point to order the dinner special from places with the idea that the chefs are sick and tired of cooking the same stuff on the menu, and will be invigorated at cooking something new and exciting. This particular night, I opted for the Miso Marinated Sea Bass. Sounds great, right? I'll never know.....the server never brought it to me. Appetizer arrived, wife's meal arrived, daughter's bowl of steamed rice arrived, beer arrived, sake arrived, check arrived. Not in that order, but you get my drift. So my meal consisted of some of my wife's sushi, some of my daughter's steamed rice, some of the appetizer, beer, sake and table bread. Happy Valentines to you Cherry Blossom!  If anybody's thinking of checking this place out, get takeout. The food's good, but I can get better service at QT. (Yes, the gas station)"

1,"Best selection and prices in Cave Creek!!   The shop owner was extremely helpful and great to deal with.  I was looking for just the right piece for our home and found a beautiful Mesquite cabinet.   When I told him we were going to use it for our bathroom as a vanity base for a remodeling project, he even gave me some wax stain to help match the natural wood plank top we were making.   Seriously, what other store would do that??  Amazing customer service!   He made sure it was loaded safely into my truck with covering so it wouldn't get scratched during transport.  Super fair on the price and even gave me 10% off.   If you want  unique, one of a kind pieces for your home, give this shop a try.  They have great iron pieces,  rustic/solid wood pieces and unusual accessories.     They obviously care about their customers.   Love this store."
0,"Was all willing to give your over-priced super salty empanadas another shot at glory, man.\n\nBut when called recently, over an HOUR past your stated open, no one picked up.  I've worked pizza and deli places; know how it can be.  Tried four more times to get through.\n\nScrew you, Manolos, we are so over.  Don't come crawling back next week with your lame excuses."
0,"For food, I think the place is overrated.  For a wine bar with occasional live entertainment it's a green light.  On the restaurant side tho, I ordered lobster ravioli which was a featured dish at the time.  Did I taste any chunks of lobster?  No.  Were they overstuffed?  Not even close.  The vodka sauce was tasty but no lobster chunks there either.   If you want a salad it is a separate dish to pay for.  This lobster ravioli was priced around $21.  Was there $21 worth of food there?  Absolutely not.  The portion to price ratio is VERY skimpy.  I have had a better portion in a can of Chef Boyardee. OWNER: if you are reading this, you need to invest in a warming drawer.  I have been to your restaurant twice now and both times the food has arrived bordering on COLD.  It's the least you can do for people dropping $20+.  Please serve it hot, (this shouldn't be much to ask for?). Nice small, cozy, environment but the tables are very close together.  About average service.  You will get more for your money and a bit tastier at Buca Di Beppo across the freeway.  I won't be back here, I cannot stand cold pasta dishes and really don't enjoy throwing hard earned money away on mediocre meals."
1,"We had brunch on the patio.  I like places that you don't have to wait for what seems like forever.  I tried a little bit of everything at the table and it was all REALLY good.  Very comfort foodie.   Our server was attentive, I loved my coffee..may become our new go to brunch spot downtown."
0,"Cruise America completely ruined our vacation. We picked up the dirty, stained, broke down  RV in Fillmore, CA.. The RV was in very bad condition! ( we had drove 8 hours from home and had already paid for it so we decided to make the best of it and take it) The seats had hole's and stains, the cupboards were broken, water was leaking. They sent out 7 lady's in an RV that was dangerous. The bald front tire nearly fell off and they had to send someone out to replace it and that took two days. Then they wanted us to take it to the service center and wait for god knows how long for them to fix it or make a 3 hour trip to Compton, CA to exchange it. We opted to end our vacation and return the broke down palace back from whence it came because that was only 30 miles away and we did not feel safe traveling that distance in it! NOTHING was working, we had no power, no water, no sewer, and the indicator panel was broke, all the propane leaked out while we slept, thank God we had the windows open! My advice is to reserve a nice Hotel room! It will be cheaper and safer for you and your family! Thanks Cruise America for running our vacation and trying to kill us! I can not believe you would send people out in such a death trap....shame on you!!"
0,"If you are a 21 year old, irresponsible traveler, looking to book a room to host a party and then trash the room - then this is the hotel for you. What you don't know, up front, is that The Hard Rock charges a $100 dollar PER NIGHT deposit upon check in. I knew there was a service charge ($7.59 per night in addition to what I paid for the room) but I did not know they'd charge my credit card for $100 per night in addition to that. Why, you ask - because every other room on my floor was hosting a party!. \n\nAdd to that the fact that they charge for use of the hotel gym - an additional $20 per day and the fact that there was construction going on behind the pool area, and the construction workers thought it was a good idea to drag trollys across the pool area and wake us up at 5 am. YES - 5 AM!!!! We had to open the balcony door and yell down after 20 minutes of continual noise.\n\nAlso, take caution when dining at Mr. Lucky's. The guy across from us vomited all over the floor just before our food arrived. Be prepared to deal with the over-zealous party people who can't hold their liquor. \n\nWhat we did like about the hotel (though we'll never stay there again) was - the bed was comfortable, the rooms were nice and the casino was well appointed. Eat at the Pink Taco if you get the chance, it's really good food.\n\nThere's also a CVS pharmacy across the street where you can buy your beer for a 3rd of what the hotel charges!"
