1,"One of the best dining experiences I've had in awhile!!  We had a party of 6 and everything was perfect.  To start we had bread and butter which was to die for.  Then the waiter brought us group of 6 gals two appetizers of their bread and guacamole, with the side of their kale smoothie (yum!!).  I ordered the lunch meal which was their original salad and splurged for the fried chicken sandwich.  Everything was to die for.  I had a bite of my friend's heirloom and brie salad with chocolate shavings and that really gave me the reason to write this review.  To top it all off, I had the bread pudding which was top notch!  Excellent service (with us rowdy group of 6 ladies catching up!) and even better food.  I will DEFINITELY be back and will recommending it to all of my friends and family!"
0,"Some of the staff is wonderful! But there is one who has no customer services skills. I asked for a bloody mary, which he refused to make because he was \""busy\"" (there weren't many people in the bar). He overcharged for my drinks. He handled me being angry about this so poorly. I've never had such bad service, to the point of calling in to complain...  He just had a bad attitude and was overall a poor bartender. \n\nAlso, the sign says 3 doller well drinks, but apparently on weekends, they're 5. They don't tell you that til you close your tab and see your receipt. The sign says \""nightly\"" not weeknights.\nI usually like this place alright, when I'm just there for karaoke. But the bar side needs work. Like, new staff work."
0,"I expected to encounter long lines due to a free burger promotion on this Thursday at lunch time, but the place was not busy.  Though this restaurant has been open for several months, we were told by an employee that no one knows its open because of its location at the far end of the center.  The coupons, I printed 2, were good for standard burgers that come with lettuce, tomato, onion and American cheese plus we shared a soda.  The burgers were tasty, but dry from being overcooked."
0,"Ugh..not good. The customer service was bad. They gave us, water and didn't come back for awhile. They had buy one get one free. We got the taco plates with chicken. The chicken was mushy and tasted like tuna. I ordered a side of sour cream. She forgot it and it took about 5 minutes to get it.  We didn't finish.  Server didn't ask how our meal was."
1,"I decided to watch to show when it came out as it was said to be, \""The Sensual side of Cirque\"" and it did live up to motto. I knew I was going to run into some sexual, raunchy and of course half naked bodies running around on stage and doing some erotic acrobatic moves but I'll leave that to your imagination. \n\nMMMmm....\n\nIt was recommended that we book on the 2nd level of the theater because we'd have a better view then the front rows, plus it was less expensive so why not? The intro was unlike no other Cirque show I've seen. The host was a tall slender drag queen that would talk to the audience and ask intimidating questions about who are they with and some sexual questions that were provocative and humorous. All the dancers were talented and I enjoyed all the acts, throughout the show I've seen all types of body types on stage, full figure woman half naked, tall and small people and very attractive men and woman. I think it was suppose to evoke a sense of erotica sexual energy and being comfortable with the human body. I enjoyed every second of this show and still have some of the acts in my memory. \n\nThis truly was a sensual experience!"
0,Their coffee is one of the best places I've been to but they made me wait 30 minutes for mine. They should have given me a heads before I bought it.
0,Waited 50 minutes today for a pulled pork and a hot link sandwich before asking for our money back. I can't imagine how much longer we would of had to wait. I've heard nothing but good things about this place....so disappointed. They weren't even busy!!
1,Good!!!
1,LOVE this place.  Fish sandwiches are great.  Visiting Pittsburgh for the month and went there for the first time yesterday and am going to go back today!!!
0,"Don't think about asking to 'pick-up' your food, they won't allow it! \n\nThis was a little frustrating as I was coming home from work, I needed to get into my hotel room, eat, shower and pass out.  I get there and the first thing I ask is why can't I order to go, I get a response that because too many people were ordering food and not picking it up, oh please- that is the worse line of bull I have ever heard.  I should have thought about it, I'm sure it's a hotel policy that makes them do it because they want the individuals to play while they wait for their food.  I'm told, oh its quick- literally 5-6 minutes, I'm sitting here thinking that's not even possible, but let's see it happen! No, it wasn't possible, that girl lied worse than a politician- the food took almost 20 minutes and it wasn't worth that much of a wait for the rush I was in.  \n\nI got the steak fajitas with the whole wheat flour tortilla, and the first thing to mention is the tortilla (which there were two) were hard and crusty on the outside, like CRUUUUSSSSTTYY!! I ripped the edges off and said whatever lets dive in and make these babies!  I immediately realized there was about 3 pounds (yes I'm exaggerating, come on people!) of vegetables and 5 oz. (no I'm not exaggerating) of steak.  Literally I'm talking 6 small little pieces of steak with what I guess a whole large onion and 2 bell peppers.  The steak was good, I will say- but the overall flavor of how the onions and peppers cooked was not great, it just was bland- not a fan at all! \n\nWill I go back yes. Was I happy with the service, not so much.  I didn't like being told I couldn't pre order, I didn't like that the girl bold face lied to me about the cook time, and I didn't like that I had what felt like tortillas from the early 2000's and I wasn't happy that I got less steak than the scraps I feed my dogs.  \n\nGive this place a try, but maybe try something other than the fajitas!"
0,"I came here with 2 other people, about 2am after playing in the casino for about 4 hours. My sister in law said the had good prices on the \"" late night\"" menu. The cafe was nice, clean and comfy. Our waiter took forever to come over and when he did he wasn't very pleasant. Our order took forever. We all ordered the same thing with one having slight modifications. She asked for turkey bacon and cheese on her scrambled eggs. When our food finally showed up it looked disgusting. Everything was coated in grease, the bacon looked and tasted like it was deep fried and it looked and tasted like the eggs are made from powdered eggs. When my friend pointed out they forgot her cheese the waiter asked her if she wanted him to bring her some cheese out or have the cooks melt it on? Seriously... She sent it back with him but less then a minute later he was back with the cold cheese they sprinkled on top. She said she wasn't going to send it back for a second time because she didn't want anything extra too be in it... \n\nAll in all I've read the reviews and I'm not the only one who thinks this place sucks... I'm from out of town, I come to GVR 3-4 times a year with my family that lives in town. Guess if your drunk you don't complain but you would think someone in marketing at GVR would be vigil at this social media thing and maybe want to fix the problem... Needless to say I'd rather starve then eat here again..."
1,"KC had been to the social house before, but this was my first time. The ambiance is nice, with a dimly lit dining area and friendly waiters. Apparently, the hot thing to do there is to let the waiters bring you food until you're full. Though the food they bring out is good, don't expect it to be cheap. When the bill arrived, I realized that the waiter had done double orders on some of our dishes, especially the expensive ones. Though the Kobe beef was excellent, we would have been sufficient with 6 pieces instead of the 12 that he brought on a single plate. Also, since we didn't order, all of our dishes came sashimi style. Though it accentuated the flavor of the dishes, I left the restaurant still a bit hungry while my wallet was already dry."
0,"It tries, but at the end of the day 944 magazine is basically an Old Town Scottsdale party picture rag (usually featuring the Dirty Scottsdale crowd) written at the 8th grade level.  \n\nDon't believe me?  Flip to the back and see the last 30 pages or so.  Multiply by the number of cosmetic surgery ads and bar/club ads and you've got a lofty quotient.  The party pics are usually why people check it out.  Kind of like when married men say they read Playboy for the articles.  RIIIGGHHT!!\n\nThey are starting to cover Phoenix and Tempe a bit more than in the past, but it's primarily a Scottsdale 20-something society/nightlife magazine.\n\nPlus if you want to see a magazine clown and insult its unsuspecting and not-so-bright readers, check out the Letters to the Editor.  I mean, wow.\n\nbtw, 944 is named for its old address when its offices were located on Mill Ave."
0,Poor service but good dollar margaritas which you can upgrade o a double shot for 2$ more. We had tacos and cheese quesadilla at lunch time/ mid afternoon. Service was slow and food was mediocre. Three margaritas four tacos and quesadilla was 18$
0,I would always eat at this restaurant very great food but I have recently discovered they have a roach problem.  It seems like the problem has been addressed before but the owners seems to like the way his business is running so I have decided to place my findings here to warn other people eating..  Don't really care if you take my advice or not just be careful here
1,"***CASUAL RESTAURANT WITH UNIQUE, ORGANIC AND LOCAL OPTIONS***\n\nI recently came here for brunch on a Saturday morning for a client meeting.  Even with the Farmer's Market going on the Square, the wait was only about ten minutes at 11:00 a.m.\n\nThis restaurant is relatively new, and was opened by the owners of nearby L'Etoile.  You will notice the French influence on the menu. \n\nThe hostess will take down your number and give you a call when your table is ready.  We tried beignets and fresh fruit.  I also ordered the Bagel and Lox dish.  The everything bagel was toasted perfectly, and the cream cheese was on the side, so I can decide how much to use.  The dish came with a properly sized serving of delicious smoked salmon and fresh dill.  A definite must-try! \n\nThe OJ is truly fresh.  You will know it when you try it.  I would highly recommend trying this restaurant."
0,I had a 7:30 reservation on a Monday night.  I did not get seated until 8:15.  At 9:00 no chef had come to cook for us. I had already complained to the manager once and he did nothing. Finally my family had to leave as we had hungry young children.  I am so disappointed and will never go here again.
1,We came here with a Groupon as well. \nWe came really late so there weren't that much people. \nRoy was the one who was helping us and he was awesome and very friendly. \n\nI'm personally not a big fan of anything that involves speed or danger. So it was not really a thing for me. \nI bought the Groupon really for my fiancee. He really enjoyed it but was getting a bit nauseous from riding too fast.\nRoy was nice and offered us some water. \n\nOverall a nice experience. Come check it out
1,"I recently started an exercise routine to loose weight but was stopped after my foot starting hurting! I couldn't understand why it hurt so bad.  So when I went to Dr. Hunchak, he took the time and patience to explain it to me in a way I could understand, and he told me what to do to make it better.  That was last month and now I can say I am PAIN FREE, and back to exercising.  Go see the doctors at Westland! They are great!"
1,"Came in for an alignment. Hands down, best price in town! Customer service is top notch. It is a family owned small business but sometimes it's best to trust with your vehicle. I will be returning even it's on the other side of town for me. Worth it! Glad I found them on Yelp!"
1,"Finally got to explore the FilmBar!  Had a great time.  Met a friend for drinks before a show.  Great beer selection made drinking choices easy.  The decor is delicious.  I wanted to touch everything.  The lighting is wonderful!  My friend tipped me that the owner was our bartender/projectionist.  He was amazingly calm, even though it was a pretty busy Monday.  It was the only showning of Thor at the Bus Stop, which was a hilarious and clever film.  I appreciataed the customized previews.  FilmBar rocks, and I will be attending screenings frequently.  Side note: I left my jacket on a bar stool and came out to use the restroom.  When I finished, I found the bartender gallently holding my jacket out for me.  The service here is amazing right now.  Take advantage of it!"
1,"I AM A FAN.... of this funky little downtown dining spot. I don't really understand the theme, or maybe there isn't one at all... it's just cool! Nice patio for outside dining, which is what my wife and I opted for last week on a perfect spring evening. Our server was quick to take our orders (it was a pretty slow night, but hey, it was a Monday), and was very attentive to us our entire visit. The food was decent enough. I had the Chile Burger and my Wife had the Ostrich burger (which I actually thought was overpriced.... $12.95 for a 6oz patty... hmmmm). The fries and the potatoes that came on the side were really good though! \n\nFrom what my friends have told me, this is one of the best happy hour spots (price wise) in downtown Phoenix! We were there after happy hour and the drink prices were still pretty cheap! I'm definitely planning on dining/drinking here again!\n\nLastly, I gotta give a shout out to Vinny! The dude is probably one of the nicest, most genuine people out there! Anyone would be lucky to have him as your server at Steve's!!"
1,Nice patio in the heart of downtown mesa. We didn't eat so i can't comment on that but the wine selection was nice. We had a quick drink before a show at the MAC. The service was quick.
0,"Food was decent (blackened fish sandwhich) but like the other reviewers, service is EXTREMELY slow. It was even difficult to order drinks... They are sorely understaffed. Happy hour prices are decent but I wouldn't come back due to the service."
0,"Walking into Macayo's is like entering a buffet restaurant in a Vegas casino. Tacky, tacky, tacky. Loud wall paper. Lots of different rooms. And the people. Oh, the people! Men in Hawaiian shirts or local team jerseys. Women with big hair and lots of screaming kids. Staff is usually quick to greet and really quite friendly. Standard Mexican fare is widely available. Stick to the combo platters and you may leave happy. The carnitas entree is a sad clump of dry pork...gee, I think that's the same thing my Uncle Larry said of his third ex wife. Anyhoo, the chile con queso is quite yummy and actually not on the menu. You have to ask for it. Served with a variety of blue, yellow and red corn chips, the dippin is fun and filling. The guacamole is pretty good although it seems there's a little filler in there therefore the avocado flavor suffers a bit. I really like the mini chicken chimichangas. The minis, not the regular sized. The latter are a bit tough and big and hard enough to use as a door stopper. Macayo's is a family owned, famous Phoenix restaurant landmark. The Central Ave. location happens to be in my hood and sometimes the convience outweighs the dee-lish factor. My recommendation is two shots of chilled Patron before the food and everything seems better. Hola and adios!"
0,"We got into town at lunchtime.  Our room at Caesars wasn't ready so we decided to wait it out by having a light lunch at Central Michel Richard.  Carol W and I were well versed in Michel Richard's cuisine having dined at his Citronelle and Central in Washington D.C. and had previously dined for breakfast at Central Michel Richard and had walked away pleased.  This time...not so much. \n\nWe were joined by our respective families and seated promptly at a large round table in the sunny, airy dining room just off the Caesars' main lobby.  From this point on, our experience spiraled into the ground almost solely due to a series of missteps by our server.   Carol W recounted our difficulty in getting any drinks beyond water in her review.  Let me add that we got up from the table, went to the bar, and asked the bartender if she could make any cocktails regardless if they were on the list or not.  She could.  So, service strike #1.  I can say with 100% certainty that our server lost beer and alcohol sales to our party.  Since we had early evening dinner reservations for later that day, several people in our party asked how big portions were for several items on the menu.  Our server didn't impress us with his knowledge or familiarity with the menu as his estimates on portion size were dramatically off.  Service strike #2.  \n\nI had the plain Goat Cheese Caesar ($18 for Total Rewards members/$19/add chicken $6, filet mignon $13).  It was a nice looking salad, not over-dressed or overly salty, and possessing good flavor.  However, IT WAS A SALAD without a protein on it and $18 was exorbitant for what I received.  While there wasn't a third service strike, the overall experience was hugely disappointing and not one to inspire me to return."
0,"These guys are lazy and will scam you out of anything. I paid 70$ for a groupon for an oil change and new brakes, when I went back they told me I didn't need new breaks yet they can't refund groupons? That's fine so give me the brakes I paid for, they didn't don't go here."
1,"If you are wanting to buy some quirky and unique clothes, Kakao By K is definitely the place to go. \n\nSituated on Thistle Street, Kakao By K is right in the heart of the New Town area of Edinburgh and it is just a short walk from the main shopping street, Princes Street, and so it is a convenient place to reach. \n\nThis is a Scandinavian women's clothing store which sells a range of designers clothes including Edith and Ella, House of Lykke, Leluu and Mimosa. I only found out about this store fairly recently as it was a friend who introduced it to me and now I love to come here and admire all the lovely clothes which they stock. Kakao By K sell a range of trousers, skirts, tops, dresses and jackets, which are all of excellent quality and so most of their clothes cost around \u00a3100. \n\nI have my eye on a beautiful cream silk dress by mimosa which I think I am going to buy the next time in the store - it is gorgeous! Accessories including handbags and gloves are also available at Kakao By K."
0,"This place is really awful. It is a complete tourist trap which in my book is defined by crappy food and expensive prices...check and check.\n\nBeer: here' s a tip - don't order beer from the tap. It comes with a \""souvenir\"" plastic 'glass' and therefore costs $10 for cheap stuff like Coors Light and $12 for better beer. And that's for the small one. You can instead buy a 24 oz tall-boy in a can of Miller Lite for $5. Also look around for beer specials, we could have bought 2 pitchers of PBR and had a 3rd free. The bartenders don't willingly inform you that their beer's a rip off. \n\nFood: another tip - don't eat it. It's just awful. We were a big group so I saw what all came out. Completely mediocre bordering on sketch. I got some awful thing with rice, a hamburger patty, eggs on top with gravy. The hamburger party and the gravy were nasty. The patty clearly comes to them shaped and frozen and when sliced into it looks like the most pathetic and low quality beef ever. Blarf. I tried to look up what this creation was called so you can be sure to steer clear but their website is so awful I got fed up and quit. Gross. Good luck."
0,"I'm surprised people rated the food here 4 stars(30 reviews at this time), clearly the customer service is warm and friendly, but the food is not good.  Seems much more Filipino, which was sad, because I was craving some good Mexican after we hiked Camelback.\n\nAgain, service is fantastic(probably why the reviews are so high) but the food is not good."
0,"I have to say I do l do looooove shopping here! Best prices in town. \n\nIm overjoyed that buffalo exchange has finally gotten rid of Chrisy! I went in the store and she was no where in sight  and she was always there! Just rude and unworthy of her position. \n\nI have been selling to B.E for about 5 years. after taking a 2 year break from selling I decided to go back in & sell again. I went in the store around 7pm and BOY!! was it busy!  The manager there went through my stuff but couldn't buy anything, (Fair enough , I brought old clothes) She was really sweet and patient (best service in a while) \n\nSo I browsed around in the store and found some great GREAT clothes, for crazy low prices. It was clear that a few things were underpriced perhaps but It was a great steal for me. \n\nI went to check out and the cashier was a little weird. She noticed that my things were priced low and questioned me about it. I was so uncomftorable. I found myself explaning to her about the items! Uncalled for! I would of spoken to the manager but she was so busy, I do plan on contacting corporate. This cashier (Whitney) was unprofessional and assuming. She asked too many of the wrong questions, not did i find everything okay, how was I that day, Just \"" Wow these are priced really low, I wonder how that happened, where did you find these? Do you know how much these cost? I will never shop here again. 5 years ruined because she made me feel like a thief. \n\nThe guy on the floor was very helpful (Cory) so he and the manager (Dajohnai) are the only reason I gave this 2 stars, the cashier (Whitney) has created the worst shopping experience for me in 5 years. Great job hiring her Buffalo!\n\nStill a great place to get great, cool, funky clothes!"
0,"Terrible employees. They mumble inaudibly when speaking, don't listen to your order and are all around unfriendly. I have never felt to uncomfortable while ordering food."
0,"The waitress was on her cellphone 5 feet away from us for five mins, when we came into the restaurant she was eating right at the hostess stand, and to top it all off my boyfriend ate bad fish and he is now currently sick in bed on our vacation- ruined the trip for us. Burger was average. Fries were pretty good. Please don't go here."
0,Ok ive been here before and was very happy ..dont know what happend to night ..open my order of orange chicken and it looked like someones leftovers... not happy and will not be back and i will post pictures ..they did put a huge orange on top.. but i paid over ten bucks for this and ive gotten more with lunch specials for 4.95 with soup eggroll and rice and tea and a cookie ...
0,"I'm going to TRY to limit my review to this \""restaurant\"" and avoid going into a rant about the casino it's located in based on the fact that it's inside the stain upon society known as Circus Circus. Again, I'll try. No promises.\n\nSo, I had never been inside Circus Circus and really only went because my boyfriend and I both had never been and felt like we needed to go just because we live here and make fun of it all the time and yeah...\n\nBasically, Circus Circus was just as gross as we thought it would be and long story short, we were hungry and decided to just get something inside the casino. We picked this pizza place since it was midnight and it was one of the few restaurants still opened. \n\nThe staff at the order counter were nice enough but the food was extremely overpriced. I ordered a 6 inch personal cheese pizza and my boyfriend got a meatball sandwich. We also both got drink cups. The total was over $22.00. \n\nUhmmmm... it's a personal pizza, a sandwich, and two fountain drinks AND inside Circus Circus... where do they get off charging this much? I thought this casino was where all the broke ass families on a budget go. How can they charge this much and get business based on the clientele inside this dump?\n\nNevermind the prices, it's Vegas, it's nothing new. HOWEVER, this food was beyond nasty tasting. It wasn't just like \""Oh, this tastes kinda fake but secretly I kinda like it (i.e. Dominos pizza).\"" It literally tasted like how melted plastic smells. \n\nI forced down half of it just because it was so overpriced but after I saw that my boyfriend wasn't eating his sandwich for the same reasons, we just admitted that our food was gross as fuck and decided to go.\n\nI don't really give a crap about service because we weren't having to pay a waitress or anything since it was order-at-the-counter style. However, the people running the dining room area basically pushed us out of the place because it was close to closing time. They shut down the soda machine like 30 minutes early and as we were finishing up, a lady came over and was like, \""Do you want a box for that stuff?\"" We declined and she assumed we meant we were going to finish eating it so she said, \""Well you need to get one cause we're closing so you can't stay here.\"" It was just rude but we were on our way out so I didn't really care. Nonetheless, don't push customers out of the place cause you want to go home RIGHT at closing time.\n\nOverall, this place is a ripoff and really nasty tasting. I don't know what all the other reviewers are talking about when they say this place is amazing. I'm not a picky eater when it comes to fast food like hamburgers and pizza - I understand it's not going to be phenomenal but this place was just awful. The food tasted like the ingredients had expired. \n\nCongrats Circus Circus, you fulfilled all my expectations."
1,"Location: Cosmopolitan= high expectations for me since this is my favorite hotel on the strip. Inside the Cosmo, I have to say it is a bit difficult to find but as long as you look for directions to the Wicked Spoon, it's right next door. While waiting to go inside, I noticed many people go up to the bouncers and ask if it was the Wicked Spoon, it was kind of funny actually because the bouncers showed them it's right next to it without having an annoyed look on their face. I can't imagine how many times they are asked that question, because the entrances are really too close together. \n\nFrom the outside you have no idea what to expect. There are big doors that you can't see in and get a peek what is happening inside. I have to say, I wouldn't know it is a restaurant inside if I did not read the reviews. It's not a restaurant in which you can walk up, see the menu posted, and see the seating from the from of it and ask the hostess to seat you. Later on I spoke with the manager and he told me you need reservations normally. It is not very \""inviting\"" from the outside, so I am assuming they don't get many people just walking by wanting to come in, since you really can't tell what's behind the closed doors, giving it some mystery. \n\nThere were about 8-10 hosts/guards standing outside and letting people in, making it feel exclusive to gain entry. When we walked through the doors, there was a room almost like a rotunda with more rooms with closed doors. We were led to the theater room. I was impressed when I entered. I liked the music, the small venue, the dim lights and there are 2 bars on each side of the round stage and seating area. The drinks were free but to me, very watered down taste and nothing special. I am hoping that the drinks everyone raves about in the other reviews are much better, because they are paying top dollar for those drinks. Since mine were free, I could not complain much. \n\nWe get seated and the show starts, first with some comedy which I found offensive at times and just not funny at all. The acts, most were pretty entertaining and kept my interest. The contortionist (disturbing), dragon guy (annoying and not funny) his dog was the cutest part but it was also really sad as the dog was shaking and scared. The tightrope walker, walked and jumped, nothing amazing. The acts I did enjoy were the balancing act, hottie in the bathtub, fire girl, wine glass music, and the others. I don't think the acts amazed me, but it kept my interest to wonder what was next. \n\nComedy -1 star\nVenue/Concept/Intimate vibe/connecting rooms- 5 stars\n\nI think if I had paid for the tickets, I am not sure it's worth the price I saw on their website. I am curious to try the restaurant even though it looks really pricey and supposedly the acts that are on the stage, those people wander throughout the bar/restaurant and do a little \""scene\"" from whatever they did on the stage. I wonder if this is seen from the restaurant room or only the VIP area with the couches/restaurant area? I am curious about that. \n\nAs I walked around, I loved the idea of different rooms and found them to be quite unique.  I did see the people who were up on the stage socializing after in the bar area. I am not sure if this is how it usually is or because it was the grand opening night. \n\nI am now interested in seeing Absinthe.I also have to note that every employee I encountered there was very friendly and nice!!!"
0,Won't be back.   I used to use B&B for pens and dabbing products but the overpriced pen product they sold me broke twice in 2 months.   I paid $80 for the pen and choose to be loyal to them and buy other items like a dabbing rig as well.  The owner seemed chill when I bought the product and then when I came in to replace the product acted upset because he gets a lot of returns on that product specifically.   Here's a thought : if the product is cheap don't sell it.  And certainly don't get annoyed with your customers because of it.  If you choose a terrible product to sell and you know it's a cheap ineffective product and refuse to help me when I show you it's broke then I'm not going to spend another dime in your store.    If I have anything to say about it neither will any of my friends either.  I used to think highly of this store and it's ownership.  Unfortunately that opinion has drastically changed.  Sad.
1,Feels like you stepped back to a seedier time ( a good thing!) cheap strong drinks A MUST SEE in Las Vegas!
0,"Rude waitress. Copped an attitude the INSTANT she walked up to the table, not sure why.   She musta thought she was God's gift.  I clearly saw FRIJOLES BORRACHOS on the appetizer menu.  I ordered them.  She said \""We don't even serve frijoles barachos\"" in a really snotty way,  I thought I was ordering from  the captain of the cheerleaders, so STUCK UP!!! I suggest that if you are server in a restaurant, to know your menu and don't be a %$#$^.  Her RUDENESS caused us to walk out right then and there."
0,"If this is how Chef Simon had worked on Iron Chef, Cat Cora would have kicked his ass!  The food came out 45 minutes after order (\""30 Minute Lunch\"" - BS!).  The food was overcooked and the waiter did not come back to ask us anything after it was served (he came by at the end to give us the check).  Had to ask for most things twice (sugar for tea, mustard, straws).  Does the Chef not care that he has such crappy service??!  There are so many other places to eat in Vegas, one would think that Simon does not want to be one of the crappy places (wait, too late..)."
1,"On Sept 16th, we decided to try a new Mexican restaurant. This was our first time here and I gotta say we choose a good one....reasonable prices, friendly service,  good food, with large portions. The margaritas were awesome, made by James & Sean. Thanks guys for a fun dining experience. We will be back!"
1,"Best pizza downtown. Hands down. Finally a pizza joint that rises above the rest. Pop Up Pizza is as artful as Pop Up Art House in Henderson. Think a hybrid between Neapolitan style and New York style. Exceptional ingredients that are perfectly portioned with the crust. Oh the crust, light, yet firm, a with a nice crunch on the edge yet soft and pillowy inside. The crust in the center holds up to the toppings with ease. By the slice, by the pie, heck buy the slice or buy the pie. Four styles to choose from with an additional 4 on the way in the next few weeks...including a vegan variety. An entiere pie will run you about $22, by the slice-$3.50 Pop Up Pizza is located on the south end of The Plaza, just as you enter the front door from Main St. Run, do not walk to this place. Soon the lines will be out the door, up Fremont Street, then all the way down Las Vegas Blvd to the Secret Pizza Place at the Cosmo. Yeah, it's that good."
1,Super Great Food!!! The prices are not too shabby... My one flaw is the timelyness if your looking for a quick bite not the place or I suggest ordering before you come. (The food kinda takes a hot minute but it is worth it!!!) I've brought plenty of friends and they all love it. I also used them to cater my big 3-0!! Again everyone loved it!! Doesn't really matter what you order I've tried everything and it all agrees with my palate! Cheers!
0,"Disgusting!  If you go into the kitchen, you will never eat at this place.  Dirty Dirty Dirty!"
0,"The waitress taking our order was great other than that the staff was very unprofessional. We were sitting by the entrance of the kitchen and the servers were going in and out. They started to bring our order out as two of the servers bumped into each other and a hot plate of food was dropped right behind me. The hot food went everywhere burning a patch on my back and arm. No one apologized right away as a matter of fact no one even offered to clean the mess on my chair, table or purse that was hanging on the chair. They didn't even ask if I was o.k. about 10 mins later the manager comes to our table apologizes and he asks if we were o.k and I mentioned the food burned my arm and my back and that there was food everywhere. Needless to say he offered free desert, to which I said no to, and then gave us napkins to clean up the mess our selves. My 6 year old daughter was sitting next me but luckily she was o.k. We didn't want to make a scene so we ate rapidly and went home to put some cold water on my arm. I will never come here again!"
0,"You walk in and although there are many employees, the customer service was terrible. Waited 5 min for water and asked for lemon.. Got it 5 min later from another waiter. Ordered pinapaitaan and it was inedible due to the salt. Sent it back and came back less salty. Assuming water was added because it was not that hot. No meat and disappointing. Only coming here for the bakery in the future. Much better filipino food elsewhere and not overpriced as this place."
1,"Bought our wood flooring and tile from this store. Bill spent 2 hours with us helping to select our wood floors, and he was very helpful. I came back the next week and designed 3 bathrooms with Bill. He was amazing at putting flooring, wall, and accent tiles together. We shopped for 4 hours straight, filled 2 carts, and then he meticulously loaded all the tile into my vehicle. Bill is talented, joyful, and first class all the way. This store is clean, organized, and has a huge selection. The manager Heather introduced herself and shook my hand. Great customer service all the way. Financing was a 5 minute procedure at a kiosk. Take the amount you are approved for on the kiosk print out to the register when you check out. Love the 0% for 16 months deal. Don't waste your time at other stores. This is a one stop shop."
0,"Good place for the young crowd, you get a nice laid-out casino floor with great places for food and drinks within 2 minutes walking distance.\n\nTheir rooms are ehhhhhh... not too clean and can be compared to a motel. Sad to say but true."
0,"I went last night for the first time. I was very excited as I lived in Germany for five years and love German food. My companion and I tried the Sauerbraten and Beef Roulade. \nThese are two of my favorite German dishes. I was sorely disappointed. The meat was tough and flavorless as was the Spatzle and Potato Dumpling. The Red Cabbage  was good but I've tasted just as good out of a can. The highlight of the meal was the Onion Soup. That was truly delicious. However, not worth the $45 bill for two people for just the entrees. The Service was excellent with no complaint there. However, I expected much more, especially from a restaurant that has been around as long as this one. If you want to try a truly excellent German restaurant go to The German Cafe in Sierra Vista. It will give you a taste of really authentic German cooking."
0,"The person working there says the bathroom is out of order because someone stole the keys.\n It's $.50 for ice in your own cup even if your buying a drink in a bottle.\n She was rude and acted like she didn't speak English when anyone complained, but was fluent when ringing up others.\n SMH."
0,"Always bumpin' the music, and I can hear it right as I step out the elevator. They play some good music though. \n\nMajority of the population there = people over 40. \n\nYou sit yourself down, wherever there is an open table/seat..and wait for service....however long that may be. 5 minutes later, we finally saw a server, and had to wave her down ourselves. \n\nI ordered a Bloody Mary, and bf got I think Jameson on the rocks with a coke back. \n\nMy B.M was not yummy. I asked ol' girl if I can have some more tomato juice in there. Which she forgot about, so I had to ask again, and she brought out a cup of it. \n\nEven when I put a good amount of tomato juice in the drank, it still wasn't yummy. :/ \nHmm. \n\nThe Spanish olives that they provide in the drink were EXTRA salty as well. \n\nNo gusta! \n\nWent here on Halloween night to get a drink with the parents..service was much better that night."
0,"I think anyone who gives this ore than 3 stars must never have had a decent burger in their life. You  can't tell me with a straight face that the burgers here are better than Five Guys, In-N-Out, etc...Sorry, they just aren't.\n\nThe decor is nice and there are TV's everywhere, including at every booth. That's a plus. \n\nThe staff and hostess were very nice and I thought they did a good job.\n\nBut the food lacks. The $16 Kobe beef burger is bogus. There was no difference between that burger and the $9 angus burger my friend had.\n\nWe had the skinny fries and sweet potato fries. Nothing special. Period.\n\nWith 2 sodas, tax and tip, $55. NEVER AGAIN."
0,"Less then stellar steak.  Typically the food is above par, but tonight's ribeye was something I expect from Chili's.  Not sure if they have a sub-standard cut of steak for their $69 \""dinner for 2\"" or I just got a really greasy, fatty, overly charred Food Lion steak."
0,"I will first say we only ordered pizza and have never come in for a full dinner so perhaps this is unfair to review but this was my experience. Very friendly and cute little restaurant and the menu looked pretty good from what I saw online, but we only wanted a pie to go. I gotta say, we were disappointed. I was skeptical about brick oven because generally speaking the best pizza does not come out of a brick oven. We have tried most of the local pizza joints and have not had good luck of late and we try our best to stay away from the national chains. I wanted to like the pizza, but it just wasn't very good. The crust was so thin it was soggy everywhere but the edges. The edge crust was tasty and that was the highlight, which ironically is usually the least enjoyable part of a pizza. Since the crust was so thin and soggy in the middle, it did not fill us up and it could not support much sauce or toppings either. Pizza is supposed to have a thin crust, but that doesn't mean it should be so thin that its soggy and without structure enough to hold a tasty sauce, cheese and toppings. I've lived in different parts of Charlotte and for some reason all the good places are up on the northern side of town. I guess we'll have to start driving a little further for it. I give up on any place south of Harris Blvd."
0,We went here for some after work drinks and I can say confidently that I will never return. The service was terrible. Faith was our server and we ended up having to go to the bar and order our drinks for the majority of the night because she was nowhere to be found. I knew it would be a bad experience when I ordered a red sangria and she brought me a white. It wouldn't have been a big deal if she wouldn't have tried to convince me that she was right and that I was wrong. I simply declined the drink because white wine makes me ill and told her to not worry about it. She remained absent until it was time to order food. We got our food with no silver wear. Once again we had to ask the bar for anything we needed for the remainder of the night and ended up with a confusing bill with 9 shots that didn't belong. Seriously this was a mess.
0,Hot and sour soup is very bitter. It is almost like it is made of pure sour. Food is decent. My husband enjoyed the rice. It was mediocre Chinese food.
0,They took the potato skins off the menu :(
1,"This is a cute little taco stand next to Reyna's on 21st.  I ended up stopping by here with my fianc\u00e9 for a light afternoon snack after our lunch wasn't enough food for either of us.  The stand wasn't too much to look at as it was a couple of things cobbled together but there was a sign proclaiming their tacos to be the best in the city.  As such I decided to go with a chorizo taco while my fianc\u00e9 went with the shrimp at $3 each.  The man behind the grill cooked both of them up fresh while also warming the soft tortilla shells.  He asked us if we wanted everything on them and we both said yes not knowing what everything was. It ended up being some lettuce, tomato, cheese, sour cream, cilantro, salt and freshly squeezed lime juice.  I ate my taco right after receiving it and it certainly hit the spot.  The temperature of it was perfect while the chorizo had a nice kick and my favorite part was the lime juice which gave a nice little sourness to combat the heat.  My fianc\u00e9 also really enjoyed her taco and the shrimp that I tried was good.\n\nThe bottom line for me is that I would stop by here again in the future.  They had a number of interesting tacos, burritos and empanadas that I noticed on the menu that I am sure I would love."
0,"What a terrible post office. I've had multiple packages that where not delivered even when they say they are out for delivery. \nI've lived here for 2-1/2 years, and even did an address change, yet I STILL get mail from people who lived here before me. 2-1/2 years!!! \n\nI am currently tracking another package that is supposed to arrive today. My mail has been delivered....minus my package. Terrible"
0,"12/2/11: 10 minutes after I ordered my lunch, server returns to tell me my dish is very popular and it's going to be 20 minutes and hands me the menu. If my meal isn't here within 20 minutes, they will lose another star.... just not worth giving them 3 stars"
1,"The name says it all: Selection\n\nAmazing variety on 2 1/2 floors from all over the place.\nDoes not stand a chance compared to the Rockland Location, but second best is still very good.\n\n2 Parking Lots Nearby and a pretty nice building and layout inside.\nA must for my wine fix."
0,A beautiful decorum does not make for their terrible pizza.
1,"I have been here quite a few times, and everytime I bring someone new!\ni love authentic Cuban food.  I like the wide variety.\nI'm definitely a fan!"

0,"Do not go here for late night dinner hours. They stay open until 11pm on Fridays and Saturdays however, I went around 10:15pm, and by then they had stopped making any type of fresh food.  \nThe beans were being scraped from the bottom of the tin and there was little to no guacamole; so the worker pulled a tin of turned-brown guacamole from the fridge storage and tried to scrape the brown part off the top and mix it with what was left and then added a little salsa for some sort of half-assed leftovers. By the time I'd seen the \""guacamole\"" she was going to give me I was about ready to leave but just declined it altogether. (And they still had 45 minutes of service left.) \n\nDear Cafe Rio, \nDon't stay open late if you can't serve your customers the same as if they had been there at 5pm (which I have several times before). My late night meal was not \""a masterpiece.\""\n\nI'll be going to Zaba's or Chipotle for a freshly made late night dinner from now on."
0,"The meat is delicious, but would be better if it weren't cold. The meat is sliced, and then you wait for the sides. The man working the meat portion was fine, very pleasant. The woman in charge of the sides was in the back room, so the food sat there a couple minutes until she came out. Then we watched them scrape the bottom of the container for the mac and cheese (not good!), which took more time, while our food got colder and colder. By the time we got it, it was barely warm. There weren't any rolls, so we waited about 10 minutes for those...this location is struggling! My parents have been here several times and swear they've never had such poor service or cold food. I guess you take your chances."
1,"This is a real treat for anyone who wants to get some faith back in great restaurant food that is not overpriced, especially considering the quality of food they serve: organic meats, never-frozen fish, and generous portions."
0,This is an update.  After complaining to the Big O corp office and reviews on Yelp and Google the manager reached out to me.  To make me whole again they did the work and parts for no charge.  The job was completed a week ago and I am satisfied with the outcome.  For this I give an extra star but I have experienced better.  This was my FIRST time going to Big O and it will be my last... for any location!
1,"What more can you want?  I've stayed at the Luxor, MGM Grand and (I can't think right now what it was - some suites a bit off strip).  The Mirage will be my \""go to\"" from now on.  Great sized room for a general suite.  Lots of room to move around, lots of drawers and dressers.  A nice big chair to lounge in.  Flat screen.  A desk with two chairs.  Big comfy king-sized bed.  \n\nThe location was much better than down at the South End of the strip (Luxor) and the mid (MGM).  With the Venetian directly across, Ceasar's and Bellagio nearby.  For cheap gambling O'Shea's was just in reach too.  \n\nI play poker and really feel comfortable in this poker room compared to some others around town.  We ate at Cravings, Japanais and BLT burger and had great food at each one.  \n\nFrom the bag handlers to check in/out to MLife desk support to the concierge, everyone was very helpful and nice.  \n\nGreat experience all together.\n\nUpdate:  Now that I've been to 4 different MLife hotels (Luxor, MGM Grand, Aria and Mirage), I can clearly say that the Mirage wins the all-around favorite."
1,"Wow. That Rib Eye Steak was awesome! So were the appetizers, caesar salad, sides, dessert, and wine. We went all out here and ordered much more than our stomachs could handle. But it was all so good I had to eat every last bit and piece.\n\nThe steak was seasoned and cooked perfectly. It was extremely tasty and was a nice big cut. The service was excellent. The caesar salad which was created table-side was fun to watch and tasted incredible. It would have been nice if they gave us a little bit more time between the salad and when our steaks came out. The steaks were actually waiting for us in the aisle before we had completed our salad.\n\nThis meal was a fun place to go out with a group and the food was very high quality."
1,"They have big portions and everything was fresh.  Salads looked really good. In comparison, Cafe Rio was similar to Chipotle but much better.\n\nAnyway, I had the burrito and it was great.  It was an easy four stars.  The only thing holding back a five star rating was them being stingy with the meat. For eight bucks put on a little more meat."
0,ordered on-line Alfredo pizza at 8p and they called to tell me they needed to thaw more out and it would be an hour.  We decided to get the red sauce instead.  After arriving 30 minutes later they claimed out pizza was taken out for a delivery and a new one was in the oven.  waited 10 more minutes.  When we got home the dough was raw.  This is  the 2nd time in 6 months they have messed up our order.  I think domino's can get our business since they seem to get it right.
1,"TM is a handy one-stop shop for all manner of household, clothing, foodstuffs, garden and patio, even games, travel items, and handy gadgets like you would find at Sharper Image. The store is indeed a cross between Sharper Image, Bed, Bath and Beyond, and say, like a Big Lots, only on a much smaller scale. I like ducking in here when I want to pick up a new pair of discount dress socks, and maybe a high-end discounted condiment, cooking utensil, stemware, bedding, cookbook, etc. You get the idea...a very eclectic, tasteful selection of goods, usually discounted from what you would buy it for at the aforementioned stores."
1,"Signature is a great alternative to the masses of humanity at the MGM. The rooms and suites are quite affordable, but nice. The finish quality is better than the remodeled tower rooms, but there is much less wear and tear. Think of Signature as an upgrade. \n\nService was solid, staff is friendly, room was clean. It isn't luxurious, but you might call it mass affluent. You'll have a separate entrance and amenities. It is worth the extra $30 to $50."
1,"Quickly becoming my local favorite BBQ.  After a write-up in the local paper the place has been busier.  Lots of blue hairs the other day (tis the season).\n\nWent with my friend for lunch...got the rib/brisket basket combo.  I think that's what I'll be getting from now on.  I got the beans again which were okay -- with the amount of BBQ though I could do without the sides really.\n\nI think Ruggs will be outgrowing their place quickly -- that's my only current 'complaint' is that during busy times it isn't conducive really to large crowds.\n\nPerhaps during lunch they can reserve the front 2 parking spots, cone them off, and set up tables out there -- maybe a bit hot during the summer...but would have provided more seats.\n\nKeep up the good food Ruggs!"
0,"PROS: \n\nNewer style complex. \nSecurity alarm in every unit. \nFull size washer and dryer in unit.\nGated garage.\nCrown molding.\nAttractive floor-plans.\n\nCONS:\n\nGARBAGE - Dumpster overflowing into the garage with trash. Garbage all over the garage and side walks. I've seen a full size, half eaten bag of popcorn thrown on the ground with popcorn spilled everywhere.  Recently had a Wal-Mart bag with shit in it near my front door. I promptly kicked it to the floor below. I mean, how does this happen? These are not small garbage items. A bag of microwave popcorn? Are you kidding me? I actually think it's kinda funny now. I look forward to seeing what absurd garbage item I will find next. Just this morning I found cotton swab type strands near my car. At first I thought it was a tampon but it wasn't. I have no idea what it was. Classic. \n\nConclusion? Trashy people leaving trash in a somewhat attractively newer complex."
1,"If you like to eat a great sandwich this is your place. Absolutely fabulous the bread Is incredible, 12 to 15 inches of the best toasted bread You have ever had Ever this sandwich itself may only be about 3 inches wide but they make up for it in The longest of the sandwich"
0,"Had a horrible experience my very first time eating at this restaurant. To start off, we weren't offered drinks the first time the waitress visited us. I noticed there were no condiments at the table such as salt and pepper shakers, and in order to receive them we had to flag down the waitress and actually get out of the booth just to get soy sauce. I admit the food that I ordered (chicken fried rice) was good but after eating it, I found a light hair in my food. It was actually in my mouth and I had to grossly pull it out. None of us at the table had light hair (we all had black hair or dark hair). \n\nI notified the waitress about the hair and and she offered to get me a new plate of the same dish but honestly I was so disgusted that I didn't want the dish. I asked if we could get the dish taken off the bill and at first the waitress said yes, but then the manager came to our table and had the nerve to say that the hair didn't come from their employees, and insinuated that the hair came from us. I told her that I wasn't going to pay for something that had a long hair in the food. She still refused to take the meal off the tab (which by the way was only $9)  and instead offered us a promotional punch card that would've required us to dine in five times before receiving a $20 gift card of some sort. But I had no intention of coming back to dine there and told her that. She then said that there was nothing else she could do, and wouldn't be giving me back the money that I had paid for the plate with the hair in it. She then said that it was the owner who refused to comp the meal. I had asked to speak to him but apparently it was over the phone, and he wasn't actually in the restaurant. \n\nAfter going back and forth she then unwillingly took 20% off the bill. I was still unsatisfied with this offer but finally decided to take it because I knew it wasn't going to go anywhere and was fed up with arguing over a silly matter that could have been handled very easily. We then asked for the check to be split as we gave them the money and it took over 10 minutes before we even received our money back. And on top of that, I was supposed to receive $11.60 back as my change and instead only got back $10. \n\nI work in the restaurant industry as well as a server, and always try to be a pleasant customer, but I do know that when a customer is upset with something you're supposed to accommodate their needs.  Needless to say I will never come back to this restaurant. Service was horrible and the way they handle situations is very unprofessional."
0,We decided to go to SUSHISAMBA our last night in Vegas because we were really wanting to go to a nice sushi place and I read really good reviews. If I went back to Vegas I would not go here again.  Very loud and we were stuffed onto a tiny table where it felt like we were sitting at the same table as the people on each side of us.  Our server was not that polite and kind of pushy with things and very rude and snappy to the bus boys. The sushi was good but no where close to the best we've had. I understand prices in Vegas and especially certain hotels but for the portions and quality I would not go there and pay those prices again. Pretty disappointed overall.
0,"So, I'm a hookah fiend. I have one at home and probably smoke it almost on a daily basis. My friends have hookahs so I can smoke it their houses. All in all, everyone I basically know has one and we always smoke it together whether just to chill or when we have a pahteeeee. \n\nI started coming to Paymon's years ago. The hookahs were always real good and didn't taste burnt. The guys would come around to make sure the hookah was still hitting well and constantly replaced the coals. The happy hour all day Tuesday was the best with half off hookahs and lots of drinks to choose from.\n\nNowadays, I hardly ever go here, because the hookahs are always burnt and die really fast. The service is lacking now - I literally have to wave my hands in the air and do a little dance to get someone's attention. The drink refills dont come fast anymore so I'm always contemplating if I should just order two drinks instead of one. \n\nI used to like the other location on Maryland Pkway better, but I always came here due to distance. The other location is just the same now - the hookahs arent's as great. I'd advise you to just smoke at home where you'd get the best service haha"
1,"I've been to many of them, from Dodger Stadium to Wrigley Field and down to Tropicana Field, but this park is THEE BEST. Incredible views from every seat, scrumptious food with tremendous variety, and finally a good product on the field! Access, like most ballparks, can be tricky. The best bet if you don't have a parking pass is to get there early and tailgate until game time."
1,"Out of the dozen restaurants I visited while in Phoenix, this one topped the list. I was with a large group and we ordered every appetizer, entree, and desert on the menu. Every single one of these puppies motivated our group to moan and groan like Meg Ryan did in Harry Met Sally. Yes! Yes! Yes!!! Put this at the top of your \""must try list\"" when you come to Phoenix my friends!"
0,"I would NOT recommend this restaurant.  Uninteresting menu, overpriced tapas, and the atmosphere was strange.  It was a weekend night and there were few people in the restaurant.  The large size of the restaurant made the lack of people very noticeable.  The server was a very nice younger man and he did a great job, in spite of the mediocre food and weird atmosphere."
1,"Good food and better music ... A great hang out place... I wont certainly recommend it for a 3 course dinner or such, but definitely a great place to get together with some of your good ol'd buddies... And yeah, chicken wings are awsome !!"

0,I just turned 47 years old and I'm a fat chick not just a little bit of a fat chick...a fat fat chick and for me to walk away from the table and leave a sausage patty and 2 bacon sitting on the plate with one bite taken out of the bacon and had to spit that ut into a napkin has to tell you how unbelievably a****** this breakfast was this morning so awful I am dumbfounded at this point. The meat was rancid it has gone bad probably a day or two ago and they had pre cooked it and you can taste it being sour and rancid. Like I said be worse breakfast ever in my life.
0,"It's the Piggy Mac that warranted two stars, they cheesy Lovers was just a mess. The Piggy Mac consisted of bbq pork with jalapenos and mac n cheese ($6). The potential was there, but the wheat bread choice was really poor. The Cheesy Lovers Delight with Bacon ($5) was not good on any level. Dry flimsy bread, congealed cheese and bland bacon. Yes, bland bacon. Seems like an oxymoron doesn't it?"
0,We threw a birthday party for my 11 year old here. I paid $160 for the kids to swim in the pool. The room was bare and we sat around for an hour and a half until we could swim. For the amount I paid I expected a lot more. I thought that they would have games for the kids since the party was for 3 hours. We ended up getting the pool balls and air hockey pucks so the kids had something to do. The party turned out good but with no help from the y staff.
1,"AWESOME GYROS!!!! Finally, was wondering where to go for a good gyro in this town........\n\nThe hummus is good too...just ask for extra pita bread if you get the large hummus. \n\nThis is a small, walk-up-to-the counter, restaurant. But, BIG flavors coming from the kitchen. The owner, a woman from Iraq, certainly knows what she's doing."
1,They (the franchsie) make the best vietnamese coffee!!! Wish there was one in Tucson :( Nearest one is in chandler.  My favorite sandwich is #11 combination. Lee's Sandwich is the best place to get a Bahn mi.
0,"There's no doubt that the food is Good (presentation and ambience pretty great!) - but this review is about  the TERRIBLE service. \n\nLast week, I arrived at Good Food after work with a group of four friends. The time, 5:15pm. Weather, 90 degrees. \n\nWe tried the door and it was locked. I thought maybe the restaurant was closed for a private event so I waved to someone inside to ask if we should go elsewhere. The server (manager?) came over and said that they would open at 5:30pm and then closed the door.  No offer for water, no offer for menus to look over while we waited... outside in the heat.  \n\n5:30 came around....then 5:35...5:40.... We thought it was weird that they hadn't opened so another friend in our group went to check. Oh...they HAD opened and unlocked the door...they just hadn't bothered to tell us. Thanks, pal. \n\nWe were seated and the rest of the party arrived - table of seven. I can only assume that since they automatically add 20% tip (and will not split checks) for parties over 6, the server did not care about service. Unfriendly, impatient, inattentive.\n\nThis experience was a real shame."

0,"I wanted to like Cactus Bikes in ahwatukee and be a frequent customer because I like to support locally owned businesses...but as a consumer I still expect value and decent service.\n\nI've rented a bike there and liked the guys working there - a guy nicknamed \""Fish\"" helped me out and is a good guy. Went back a couple months later to buy some clipless pedals for a bike a purchased elsewhere (almost purchased from them, but found their prices on used rentals way too high and found a better value online).\n\nNew to Mountain Biking I still wanted a local bike shop for service and accessories and was looking for advice and ended up buying a used pair of pedals that they recommended.\n\nGot home, did some reviews on the pedals and found out that not only were they OLD models that are no longer sold, they had HORRIBLE reviews AND I OVERPAID - - THEY CHARGED ME FULL RETAIL for used merchandise!!! I could have gotten much better pedals, new, online or on ebay for half the price.\n\nSo I took them back less than 24 hours for a refund...and then I learned of the consumer dreaded \""RETURNS FOR STORE CREDIT ONLY\"". \n\nIn my opinion, this is just bad business and virtually gauranntees that I won't be back. I can't blame the guys working there...they're just employees and follow orders - not their fault. I do hope the owner reads this and changes their policy...\n\nSo the employees did what they could within the narrow boundaries set by the owner, tried to help but I just wasn't happy, they exchanged them for another pair of used pedals they had in stock. In this economy I like to feel good about the money I spend...and I left Cactus Bikes feeling like they got the best of me."
1,"I hope I never have to use this company again... In the best way possible.  \nThis past summer I noticed a few bees swarming around a auto security light we had that would turn on at night when I let my dogs out.  The next morning I did some investigating and discovered they were COMING OUT OF MU HOUSE!!!!!\nAfter a quick yelp search I found this company.  They had a guy come out that day, he investigated and and said he would have to remove part of my patio overhang to get to them.  As we were talking he heard some kids playing in the pool at the apartments behind my backyard.  He told me the bees would swarm over to the water and could not spray that day.  Pain in my ass but I can appreciate looking out for the kids.  \nHe came at 6 am on a saturday to finish the work.  He discovered that the bees  were coming from an odd walled off part of my patio carver that meshed up to the house and luckily not in my walls or anything! He took off what he needed without ruining my patio, and soon discovered 10 pounds of honey comb! How I never noticed these bastards was beyond me! I think for the whole thing. bee removal and honey removal it was 300.  I was honestly expecting much more.  \nI really liked how informative the guy was... Informing me that labs (one of my 3 dogs) are naturally predisposed to being allergic to bees, not to use a shop vac to clean up the bees (the vac will crush the dead ones (btw that can still sting you.. or dogs.. when dead) and release pheromones and ill attract the others) \nHe also insulated the weird crawl space thing they were in, and put bee deterrent in there and guaranteed no bees for a year in that same spot, or hell come back for free!! \n\nI was so overwhelmed by the service, and quick response time!  It might sound really lame but a bee infestation is really scary.... I honestly felt violated... and they were so kind and comforting. \nLike i said... I hope I never have to see them again, but If I had any more \""house guests\"" I wouldn't hesitate to call."

1,"Un super endroit autant pour les 5@7 que pour les fins de soir\u00e9e.

Et oui Mesdames, rien de tel que de savourez un d\u00e9licieux cocktail en magasinant...\n\nLes fins de semaine le bar se transforme en piste de danse pour s'endiabler jusqu'\u00e0 3h. \n\nD\u00e9finitivement un bel endroit festif que je recommande fortement !"
1,heard a lot of good things about this place unfortunately the closest to me is in las vegas. since i was in vegas i dropped by for a sandwich to go and decided on the capistrami. i thought it was a 8.5 out of 10. The bread was the best part of the sandwich. the pastrami was tasty but i've had better. that's not saying i wouldn't go here again because i absolutely will. good thing that i just found out there is one now in my city of torrance. i will be trying that one shortly...like as in tomorrow!
1,"I don't think I've had a dish from pita jungle that I didn't like. I started with a simple gyro and really love the simple flavors that come together to make a delicious pita. I've even ventured over to their salads and specials and really like their micro plate - everything I need, everything delicious all on one plate. This location has a very convenient to go window that makes it ideal to call and pick up an order for lunch."
0,"Wor won ton soup + Chicken and mixed vegetables. ==23.60?\n\nI ordered around 8pm, and i recieved my food at 9:30.\n\ni received two small containers that did not have enough food for two people.\n\nWor won ton soup = flavorless, and two won tons.\nChicken with mixed veggies = a whole lot of veggies, no chicken?!!!\n\nSo to sum it all up, slow service, flavorless food, and no chicken!!!!"
0,"The burrito is full of chicken but that is where it ends. there is minimal flavor and the food is overpriced, what do you expect in an airport. On a positive note the service was decent."
1,"I scheduled my appointment via phone for my two cats.  All I needed was to get their claws trimmed and their teeth brushed and the guy scheduled me.  When I went into the store they didn't even ask me my name.  They saw I had a kitten (was only able to catch one of my kittens, the other wouldn't leave the house that day) and immediately took care of her.  Obviously it's mostly dogs, and as the guy said on the phone, if there is a cat in there they will do them first because they don't want the cats stressing out.  Love that!  So I got Zoey's claws trimmed, and to my dismay, she was being a lot easier on this professional!  I felt betrayed, Zoey is always giving me a hard time when I clip her claws.  Then I asked about the teeth brushing (this is where 5 stars goes to 4) and the lady said that cats don't need their teeth brushed because the foam doesn't work the same way it would for dogs.  Now, this is the first time I've ever heard this.  I've even looked it up before and from most of my reading it says cats should get their teeth brushed (some even say as often as humans).  Maybe that's her opinion, and while I would've preferred her to just brush them anyway, she just gave her some breath-spray instead.  Which is fine.  The customer service I received was great, but it still is confusing to me how the guy on the phone allowed me to scheduled a teeth cleaning but when I go in there, this lady tells me they don't do that for cats.  Hmm.  Just a bit of some confusion there.  Anyway, it was 5 dollars to get the claws trimmed and I was in and out in 5 minutes as well, overall great experience!  All the grooming seems to be done out in the open, which is really good to see, they shouldn't have anything to hide.  Everyone else in there was friendly."
0,"Disappointed after reading all the reviews.  Had the kimchi beef fried rice and barely ate any of it.  The kimchi flavor was so overpowering, I could hardly taste anything else (and it's not like I'm not used to the flavor - I'm half Asian and was raised on Asian food).  There was hardly any beef in it (trust me, I dug through the pile of rice looking for it).  That said, the portions are huge and the service was nice.  I just wish I had ordered something else."
1,You would be insane not to eat here. It's a perfect experience from all angles.
1,"What a wonderful job hanging tv, audio shelf, hiding wires, and doing some electrical work.. Your one time shopping for just about anything around the home. Great job Travis !"
1,"We have been regulars here for a while.  I would have said 5 stars, but I am not the biggest fan of the last menu change (it was changed a while ago).  Queso dip and gold medal sauce is awesome.  Get that gold medal on wings, boneless wings, wraps...doesn't matter.  It is great!  We have always been crazy about one of the waiters as well.  Haven't seen him around in a while, so we have now forgotten his name.  He was very very nice.  Only down side is the parking can be a pain sometimes.  Lot has tiny spaces and not enough of them."
1,"I love love love this place for all the reasons that you can love a little restaurant.\nThe shop is small but cozy and they made sure that there is still plenty of space to sit and enjoy if you choose, but you can also order to go and either way the food gets to you quickly. It is also very fairly priced.\nThe food is good. The teriyaki chicken or beef are at the top of the list to try. The orange chicken, lemon chicken, beef and broccoli, mongolian beef, sweet and sour pork and all styles of fried rice are really good as well.\nThe other reason that I love to come here is because of the sweet gentleman that is ALWAYS behind that counter. He is just a character. He always seems so happy to see anyone and everyone, and he will most definitely put a smile on your face. It's nearly impossible to order from him and not.\nAll around I love to come here and I suggest that everyone give it a try."

1,We happened by here and decided to stop in for a late lunch.  Best decision of the day.  Hands down the best Mexican food I have ever eaten in a nice atmosphere with great service.  Go and you will not be disappointed.
0,"Just waited 30 minutes for two hot dogs and cold french fries.  This place is called McGee's, but the sign outside capitol petro says Gyro House.  Inside (and on their receipts) it says McGee's.  I ordered my food, two other people ordered food.  We all waited.  The last person to order got her food first, followed by the second group.  I was last to receive my food, even though I had ordered first.  I took my food home to eat and the fries were cold, hot dogs not particularly hot.  Can't believe the service here.  I wouldn't go back again.  Fries are very bland and hot dogs are covered in ketchup, mustard, and other toppings.  Food wasn't bad, but after sitting for as long as I think they did, the bread was completely soggy and fell apart.  I was wary after reading some of the reviews, but the reviews didn't accurately prepare me for today.  It was twice as long of a wait than anticipated, the fries were not good (as described), and the food just wasn't prepared well or delievered when it should have been."
0,"We ordered take out. They were here within a timely manner. My egg rolls were ok...just tasted old.   The sweet and sour sauce was the worst. I LOVE chinese and love sweet and sour sauce. First off, it smelled like sweet and sour sauce mixed with puke. I'm not kidding. I wouldnt say that to be mean, it is LITERALLY what it smelled like. We liked the crab puffs...just didnt have anything GOOD to dip them in. We both ordered teriyaki combo plates, and pork fried rice as well. Rice was ok...not much flavor. Hub never even got to his teriyaki last night....bad thing is, I did. I had probably about 5 bites before I put it in the fridge for tomorrow. It was the only thing I ate that hub didnt. I was up ALL NIGHT long in the bathroom. Sick as a dog. The teriyaki meals are still in my fridge and I plan to call about it.  ( JUST CALLED THE PLACE) spoke with the manager. I asked for a refund on just my two meals that wouldve totalled less that $15.  My order including tip- I even tipped 8 dollars!- was $38.   I've lived in peoria all 28 years of my life, and order from this place quite frequently. I have never asked for a refund or complained before. Usually they are our GO TO for chinese take out.  Guy said no, beccause people can eat, get full,and then call for refund.    ONe of my meals had like 5 bites taken out of it (that's what got me sick) and hub didnt even touch his yet, he put it in the fridge and was saving it for today......SO I OFFERED to take the food back to them.  He said no again. I asked for higher up and than him and he said there was no higher....just the owner. I asked for the owner's info or to give him my info for contact and he refused!  He said the owner would think it was silly and would laugh at him for not being able to handle it.   I said, ok, then why isnt this handled?   He again refused to take my info and then hung up on me.   I told him I write reviews and would post to the BBB- I wanted to speak with the owner. Im not some cheapy trying to get my money back.  I have a house, two vehicles, and a small business. $15 isnt anything but principal at this point. Your food made someone sick.  I didnt ask for a full refund and I tipped MORE than what is adequate.  I WAS a good customer and now they have lost our business.            Today is mother's day. Last night we ordered take out cause my inlaws just took the kids for the night. It was my relax night....and I ended up in the bathroom all night long- and feeling like crap this morning.     My review and issue is on to the BBB next, and any place else I can post about it.    It's just not right!"
1,"Eating fish, while watching fish swim by? Sure, why not!\n\nWe started with the crab, mango & avocado stack. It was ridic. Very good. Just watch out for those hidden jalape\u00f1os! I had the seared chilean sea bass that was stuffed with crab & lobster, because duh. The orzo that came with it was delicious, and the fish was so good. It definitely had 30 pounds of butter on it, but hey, I'm on vacation! My date/cousin had the macadamia crusted mahi, and damn it was good too. \n\nThere were so many things on the menu I wanted to eat, but neither my stomach nor my pocketbook are big enough to fit them all in. \n\nThe prices are definitely a little steep, but we were wanting to treat ourselves, so when in Rome (or, well, the Golden Nugget)!\n\nWatch out for that giant green eel. He was eyeing my dish."
0,"It took me 30 minutes until my pizza was cool enough to put in my mouth without fear of scalding my tongue and rendering me mute. When I was able to safely eat my order it was very \""meh\"". There's no real taste and it looks like they just pulled it out of a grease sauna.\n\nThe interior looks like they gutted a Chompies and tried to fill it in a quarter of the space.\n\nThe service was mediocre at best. For a place that small and with all the waiters going around, how hard is it to drop by the table more than twice?\n\nThere's nothing really NY about this place. The rape scene with Harvey Keitel in Bad Lieutenant would've been a more enjoyable and a NY experience than eating at this place was."
1,"Is it possible to go to the desert and have the best sushi ever? I kept asking myself that same question on Saturday night while I enjoyed every plate of sashimi that was served.  \n\nWe didn't have resos, so I thought if we showed up early they would seat us.  We were lucky and grabbed 2 seats at the bar, so we could watch the preparation of everything wonderful we were about to experience.\n\nOur waiter suggested that we order about 4-6 dishes and we started out with 4 and of course, ordered more later:)  \nHamachi with citrus to start was perfect- just enough  grapefruit to perfectly offset the hamachi with avocado and cilantro.\nTako and tomato- was such a pleasant surprise!  Who would have thought fresh mozzarella, octopus and an organic tomato would be such a great mix?\nBig Eye Tuna sashimi- I could have ordered another 5 plates of this!  It was completely delicious and smooth at the same time.  \nSaikyo Yaki- Miso cooked cod- How can you resist? You can't!\n\nThe best quality about Sea Saw is fresh wasabi!  I've only seen wasabi made once and that was on Martha Stewart Show.  \n\nIt's such a treat to have this tiny restaurant take all the extra steps to make your dinner so good and so special.\n\nI'll definitely be back. Chef Nobu and his team made such an impression and everything was so wonderful.  Yes, this is the best sushi and yes, I did travel to the desert for it!"
0,"I treated my brother on July 9th to dinner and a movie. Our check in experience and food ordering was great (though extremely overpriced). However, there was a problem with the movie at one point and the sound continued while the picture went dark. This wasn't a huge problem in itself, however I was extremely disappointed with the way the ipic employees handled this situation (or didn't...).\n\nTwo employees came into the room and stood by the exit while someone was up fixing the movie. They made no announcement to guests and just chatted inappropriately between themselves. I could audibly hear profanity as well as a comment that \""this happens about once a month because ---[name of employee I don't remember]--- is such an *f------* idiot.\"" This is extremely unprofessional behavior contrasting with the \""classy\"" environment that ipic tries to promote.\n\nAnother incident occurred outside of the theater while I was on my way to the restroom. I heard one of the employees talking about when her shift is up and joining a group for shots. This in itself would not have been a major issue to me, but in light of what else was happening that evening I felt it necessary to include. \n\nOverall I was offended by the inappropriate behavior of the staff and was extremely unimpressed that no one took control of the situation or offered anything at all to the guests for the disruption. \n\nI will NOT be returning."

Ever so often got too step outside the box and go crazy get your guilty pleasures in life. I went for strawberry smoothies with favorite booster or add on whey protein. It same awesome tasting fruit smoothie had who knows the last time. \n\nThe location I believe like most of the other ones usually coffee bean and tea literally attached next too it. This location no difference if smoothies not cup of tea could walk over and get some coffee. Not much comes too food selection here but then again who really comes too Jamba for like snack??

0,"MGM is pricey...well the main \""strip\"" of Vegas in casinos are pricey! Drinks here are $10 and up. We had a free drink coupon when we checked in, so we spent it here. 1 drink coupon of $15 = 1 free drink here. The drinks were OK only...I've had better elsewhere."

It does not even deserve 1 star."
0,"I have used this shop for a few years, but I have to admit I am not happy with their service right now, I had a Hayward vacuum that they fixed twice under warranty, and the same thing broke again - instead of perhaps considering I just got a bad vacuum I was told I had excessive use???? Really - how exactly does one use a pool vacuum too much?  I don't run it 24/7, its a small play pool and the vacuum is less than 2 years old.  Now they want me to pay over $200 and to be honest they weren't very nice about it either.  I don't think I will go back here."

1,"I flew in on a late-evening flight and I was STARVING! Apparently there are not many late-night food options in this city, so I was pleased to find an Applebees on my Google maps because I know they are always open until mid-night. \n\nI sat at the bar and I was served by a male bartender. I think his name was Mike. He was very chatty and friendly. I ordered some items not on the happy hour menu and he informed me of similar options that were on the happy hour menu. I ended up going with my original choice despite the price difference, but it was nice to know my options. \n\nMy Patron margarita was very good & my Chicken Ques was awesome as usual. I would go back."
0,"Went here with my husband a few days ago and was severely disappointed. After reading all the positive yelp reviews I was excited to go here. Upon arriving we were told by Fran that our table had been given away because we were \""late\"". When we made our reservation we were not told about any late policy but said we would be there in 15 and they said ok. So to hear that they had just given our table away \""45 seconds ago\"" really passed me off. Why ask for a cell phone number if you aren't going to call before giving our table away?\n\nFran came off very abrasive and I was ready to walk out.\n\nI could write about the terrible wait staff and how the waitress only took my husband's drink order and walked away without even letting me order. But I'll get to the food...\n\nThe food. After waiting an hour and a half for our food to come out...and it sitting in the window for 15 mins before being brought to us... Nothing to write home about. We had the bacon covered tater tots and corn nuggets for appetizers. Overpriced... we got 9 tater tots and 10 corn nuggets for $8 a piece. Our burgers were cooked completely different...His was medium rare and mine was well done. The waitress did not ask how we wanted them cooked. The fries, boasted to be the \""Best in Charlotte\"" were anything but. My fries were limp and not fully cooked while my husband's were over cooked.\n\nThe seating was very cramped and the decor was lacking. Fran came by our table and was very condescending when asking if everything was ok. Our waitress didn't tell us the specials or even ask if we wanted dessert. Just brought us the check. Thank god she did.\n\n$55 for burgers and 2 appetizers?\n\nWe will never be coming here again."

1,"I just did the photography for Yelp's \""Little Yelp of Horrors\"" halloween party last night at 12 West Main. The event turned out great! I don't think it would have been quite as fun anywhere else. The Staff at 12 West Main are kind, friendly, and super easy to work with. Coming from a photographers prospective 12 West Main is a great location for weddings and all sorts of special events. It's industrial chic design leaves the doors open for so many different options. This place has great texture with red brick walls and beautiful industrial concrete floors. A versatile venue offering excellent catering, full service wet bars and more, 12 West Main is the Bee's Knees!"
0,"Went to Saddle Ranch with friends for the first time a month or so ago... That visit was fun. Server was pleasant, we got our food & drinks quickly, everything was great for the price. Something huge must have happened between then and yesterday. Place was a wasteland, but we had to wait for a table. Took forever to get our first round of drinks because the \""bar was backed up\"" with the dozen other people in the building (they did apologize for that, and comped our next round, that was nice). Food was cooked wrong, the menu included items they don't even have, and we kinda wanted another round when the server brought our bill out. Then the bill was all jumbled up. My food was on one tab, my drinks on another. Plastic drinking cups were cracked and dirty. The girls want to give it another try, but I'm pretty sure I'm done with Saddle Ranch."
1,"After reading the reviews and checking out the menu, we decided to add this place to our most recent Vegas agenda. We stopped in for lunch on Sunday, no reservation and we didn't want to wait, so we didn't get to enjoy the patio experience, maybe next time.\n\nThe food was fantastic, we ordered several things to share. We had the french onion soup which was perfect. The mussels were great and we had to keep stopping the wait staff from trying to take the bowl away as we sopped up every last bit of the yummy sauce with the frites. The frites are definitely a little different, not the average french fry like you would think. They are small, super thin and crispy. Good, but it would have been easier to soak up the sauce from the mussles with something a little more substantial. The fish and frites was really good, again not what you would expect as its not \""fish and chips\"" - this comes out just a large piece of breaded fish on the plate, but the fish was perfectly cooked and seasoned. And we also had the croque monsieur, the yummy combination of gruyere and ham on thick bread was sooo good. I've been craving one of these for days!\n\nAlthough our waitress wasn't terribly friendly she got the job done. There are so many workers running around, taking plates and bringing bread and filling water that I can't complain about the service.\n\nOverall, a great meal on the Strip - we'll definitely be back!"

1,"Delicious, but expensive.\n\nDined here a few weeks ago and I just remembered right now how awesome the dinner rolls were. They looked sweet from the glaze on top, but there was salt sprinkled on top.\n\nCame here during Pacquiao-Cotto fight weekend so excitement was in the air at MGM. The restaurant was packed and everybody looked like they were having a good time.\n\nWith our party of 6, most of us ordered the surf and turf deal with respective sides. My gf and I got that along with the carrots and risotto.   Take note that the sides are HUGE and definitely family style. The filet mignon and shrimp was satisfying.\n\nAfter feasting, we ended the night with chocolate souffle and ridiculous sized serving of coffee. Each person got their own french press!\n\n6 people = $750. If you're looking for a lower priced steakhouse with a celebrity chef, I'd highly recommend StripSteak by Michael Mina at Mandalay."

0,"I went here with my husband last night (a Wednesday). I first want to mention that we are both vegetarians, so I won't be the best person to listen to regarding entrees. I had a restaurant.com certificate and since my husband loves blues music I thought it would be fun to go order some drinks and appetizers and listen to the live band. \n\nIn order to even get into the restaurant, we had to pay a $5 pp cover charge. (I don't remember ever paying a cover charge to go eat at House of Blues while they had live music...have things changed?) Well, we said, we had already made a special trip to get there. We paid $10 and sat down. Our server was very nice and helpful, but after \""love\"" let out the place filled up and service came to a standstill. \n\nWe ordered the fried pickles, nachos, mac n cheese, and strawberry shortcake. The pickles were so salty I couldn't eat them (unless I wanted to head straight to the doctor for blood pressure medicine), the mac n cheese was eh, and the cake in the strawberry shortcake was soggy. The nachos were good but they didn't have BBQ sauce on them like the menu stated, and we were for some reason charged an extra dollar for cheese. Extra for cheese on nachos? Service was at a halt by the time we got our check so we didn't feel like arguing over the extra dollar... I guess I can't complain much. \n\nIn all, I would say that if you are looking for a lounge experience to drink and listen to music- this place is great. Draft beer is $10 for the first glass and $2 for refills, a good deal if you don't have to drive home like we did. The band was pretty good too. If you are going to eat dinner, be prepared for some \""ok\"" food and not being able to hear the people at your table over the live music."
0,"** I'm reviewing the nightlife at Koi, not the restaurant.  **\n\nDuring our recent visit to Las Vegas my fianc\u00e9 & I went to Planet Hollywood.  Upon entering the hotel we were handed \""VIP\"" wristbands to their new club, Koi.  We were told that it was free entrance & ladies have open bar all night.  Sounded like a good idea, right?\n\nLater that evening we decided to check it out.  The wristbands did not get anyone free entrance - it was $20 WITH wristband. What a joke!  My brother had a table reserved inside so we were all able to get in for \""free\"" since we were getting bottle service.  There were 8 of us, 4 girls and 4 guys.  \n\nI was not impressed with Koi.  By Vegas standards I would say this \""club\"" should remain a restaurant & maybe just stay open as a lounge/bar after hours.  It is NOT worth paying for.  The club was small & I was disgusted with the under-dressed crowd.  Usually the ladies & gents are dressed to impress at these establishments but women in their flip flops, men in their raggedy t-shirts, & LIMITED open bar was a total disappointment.  And why the hell were some women dancing barefoot on their sticky floor? Yuck!\n\nOur bottle was running low so I decided to go to the bar and take advantage of their open bar promo. As it turned out, champagne was not included so I still had to pay for my glass of bubbly.  \n\nThe music was decent but at times the dance floor totally cleared out.  It was not consistent.\n\nI hope their restaurant is better but I won't be back to find out."
0,Only good for happy hour. Eight dollars a glass of cheap wine is over priced.
1,"I enjoy this place very well. It's definitely on the expensive side, but I've had the beef wellington special, and the surf and turf, and some of the veal.  It was all excellent.  The view is amazing.  I can definitely imagine that some stuff is great here, while others isn't.  I would recommend to always order one of the specials."
1,"A study in stark contrast when compared to David's Bridal.\n\nMichelle's Bridal, I don't mind saying, is the shit.\n\nThey have a fabulous selection of dresses from great designers (Maggie Sottero, Sottero & Midgley, Mori Lee, Essense of Australia, Casablanca, Enzoani, and Alfred Angelo).  And that's only the wedding dresses!  They also have extensive selections for the bridal party, tuxes, and prom dresses.  \n\nThe shop itself is beautiful, has gorgeous wood floors, is well-layed out, well-furnished and is always kept tidy and clean.\n\nThe staff is beyond friendly and helpful.  My consultant, Melissa, is experienced, talkative, and honest (l like it when I'm not just being pandered to, but being given honest opinions).  She has had infinite patience with me so far, which is greatly appreciated.  \n\nJust be sure to make an appointment and you'll get a whole hour and a half to kill there.  Unlike some places, you get to walk around, browse through the dresses and pick as many as you'd like to try on.  The consultant doesn't stay right there to make you feel rushed, either, which I thought was fantastic.  I went shopping alone, but I didn't feel like I was alone, because Melissa was so attentive.  She obliged me by taking multiple pictures of each dress (another benefit of this place).\n\nI don't think they're too outrageously expensive....I've checked, and they're not too far over suggested retail prices (after all, they're an independent business who needs to make money to operate).  Plus, they do have sales on each designer sometime throughout the year, so you can just wait for those if you have the time.  And there's a seamstress on staff who charges considerably less than those at, say, David's Bridal.\n\nHighly recommended all around."
0,"This hotel is full of creepy drunks and non drunks and it's suppose to be kid friendly?  I think it's too dark in this hotel.\n\nI just came back from Vegas a few hours ago. I stayed at circus circus as a last minute trip.  The rates are super cheap. \nMy room was in one of those manors unfortunately. I don't know why it's not even part of the main hotel.  It's a pretty scary and dangerous place to stay especially walking at night or evening for that matter. \n\nIt's away from everything.  The signs inside and outside of the hotel were unclear. Looking for the registration desk and stuff was annoying cause it was soo dArk! I mean geez.. \n\nWhen my friend and i walked to our room, the cleaning crews were still inside cleaning like really? We checked in and hour after check in time and the rooms aren't even ready? \n\nPros: $10 slot machine credit upon checking in\n\nFree boarding pass printing\n\nCheap rates( expect to get what you paid for)\n\n24 hour deli inside main hotel\n\nFree parking!\n\nCons: scary at night \n\nNot many places open late around this hotel\n\nStaying at the manor"
1,Bond is a bar and now a table games pit with ballerina dancers and a girl that swings on a swing :) pretty crazy awesome. Go check out the Bond girls and play a lil blackjack or war or some roulette :) as you enjoy ballerinas dancing in front of you while you play. They have specialty cocktails coming to you because the bond bar is just a few seconds away. Great spot to get quick drinks while gambling :) you can also enjoy the best music from the DJ's that are there live every single night :)\nNice place to lounge and maybe dance a lil with a good group of friends.
1,"Coming home from a movie I searched Yelp for somewhere new to try..  Like other reviewers said, this was near my house and I had no idea it was there.  My husband and I shared a 24oz Porterhouse steak for $24.  It was plenty for both of us and DELISH! We added a baked potatoes and it came with salad bar, cowboy beans, and bread.  It was an extra $4 for splitting the steak for me to get the sides as well.  \nWe sat on the patio watching the sun go down and enjoying the beautiful view.  While we were there, a group came in on horseback.  You can ride from the Ponderosa, have dinner, and ride back.  We might try that another time.  There is a huge side patio that would make a great site for a dance or reception."
0,"Ate at El Encanto on 9/25 for lunch with the wife.  We came here because we heard about the great atmosphere and with 3.5 stars it was actually one of the higher rated Mexican places in North Scottsdale (which I still find weird).\n\nOh Yelp how you let me down!!!!  3.5 stars - if you stuck to chips, salsa and bottled beer I could understand that rating but my meal was left 2/3 uneaten (appetizer and entree).\n\nThe setting is unique but is far from special if you are not sitting next to the interior pond.  We were stuck far away from the pond next to a dirty server station and rusty spigot and hose.  When we asked to move \""nothing else was available\"" . . . \n\nFor an appetizer I ordered the Queso Guillermo.  The only thing accurate about the menu description was \""hot bubbling . . .\""  The add-on crispy beef Machomos was truly bad - the two bites I had you had to soften it in your mouth for 30 seconds before you could chew it - like really old beef jerky.  The cheese was stuck to the bottom of the skillet and the oil had separated leaving a wet, greasy mixture of chiles onions and tomatoes.  I hate being so negative but I really lost my appetite after this appetizer.\n\nWhat really sent me over the edge was when the Guacamole arrived - a perfect ice-cream scoop of guacamole that must have been served and stored in a very cold refrigerator long before our order was placed because their were ice crystals in the tomato garnish.\n\nThe only thing positive I can say is that they serve cold beer . . ."
1,"I stopped in here only one time with my graveyard bartender buddy from Hooters to see Juan, one of the graveyard bartenders at Rounders (who kicks ass by the way). From my first impression this is a very nice place! A lot newer than most other local bars with gaming. And one of the few places in the Mountains Edge area. When I lived in Mountains Edge I couldn't wait for this place to open but moved too soon!\n\nIf you live in Mountains Edge this is a \""must go\"" destination for you. If you live nearby in the SW it's worth the short trip to check this place out."
1,"I think this place is pretty great. It's your typical -- hole in the wall, beer, pool, darts, Golden Tee, jukebox, bar food, cheap drinks, friendly people, blue collar, mostly regulars, but still friendly to newbies -- kind of place. A great place to watch a game, even better for a Nascar race (CAUTION!!!).\n\nOne thing I love is that the bartenders cook the food right in front of you at the bar. That seemed a bit odd at first, but it turns out to be a great thing because you can be more involved in the preparation of your food and see exactly what they're doing. No guessing about what's actually happening in the kitchen. Some of them are really good cooks too; you might learn something. The drinks are dirt cheap, the staff is super friendly, and the drama is always low. Just sit down, drink a beer and make a friend. Simple as that.\n\nA quick note to the negative reviewers on this page: Your experience is not common. Every place has bad nights. Overall, this place is pretty great, especially if you're expecting a casual experience. I understand it's not for everybody, since it is a bit rough around the edges. I wouldn't bring a prom date here or anything. But if you're just looking to kick back and watch a game, it might be worth another shot."
0,"Nacho Daddy happens to have a vegan menu, which is awesome. The server we had was very nice but somehow my meal got mixed up and I ended up with something non-vegan. My friend from Vegas eats here all the time, she's a vegan and loves it but I wasn't impressed. Receiving the wrong meal kind of put me off and I didn't really enjoy the food either. It may have just been an off day but unfortunately, I can't give a good recommendation for it."
1,"Born and Raised are Dog Friendly in their Patio area.  Yuppy!!!  \n\nThey treated Bentley (my dog) and I with red carpet during yesterday's game.  This was my first time there and certainly not the last.  The attention was incredible and so friendly.  The food was really good and very distinctively flavored.  I can tell you those chicken taquitos I had were not frozen and well priced.  Loved the ambiance inside and the plushy sofas inside, although I was sitting outside because I was with my dog.  Overall a great place, go ahead and try it."
0,We went to Sunday Mother's Day brunch. It was 50 dollars plus. I ordered a mimosa assuming it was included like most Sunday brunches but it was extra. I wanted fresh berries but they didn't have any of those either. Great atmosphere but a real rip off on the food side . Really limited selection . A true tourist trap .
1,"Course is very demanding. Either you hit it straight or you are in trouble (I lost 5 balls). Tie boxes and greens are in great shape, only issue is fare way out of boundary markers need up keep. \nRestaurant staff is remarkable, pro shop was too relaxed and seemed on the on-fence to any remark made. We where informed they would close at 4PM, arrived at 3:20 with the entire complex locked up and no one I'm sight.\nI called the next day to insure the golf cart was taken that night."
0,"Had high expectations as I came back with my boyfriend. We met here at night for drinks only on our first date.\nThis place is nice. decor is gorgeous. service is nice. The food though is nothing to write home about the turkey club was dry, and the chopped salad was a disappointment with undressed ice berg grilled lunch meat on top(same meat as our sandwich). It was underwhelming to say the least."
1,"Best doughnuts and pastries I've had in a decade, vegan or not! Doughnuts are moist, fluffy, and delicious, the pastries are delicate and flaky.  The selection is great, all excellent, choose your fancy and you'll be pleased.\n\nThe service is very attentive and pleasing, prices are the average.\n\nI almost wish I lived in Vegas, I'd be there every day.\n\nProtip: Expect limited choices later in the day cause they go quick!"
0,"This place deserves no stars.. This is one of the worst places to get your nails done or any service. Its very dirty,the workers are rude, they talk crap on front of you. I know a few words and slangs and I told the lady I understand what your saying..."
0,"Good service, very mediocre steak, sides and dessert."
1,"Didnt gamble, just hung out in lounge. Singers who also dealt black jack were fun. Cocktail waitress Anji was top notch."
1,Best Price in Las Vegas for lunch Buffet.\n\nI love eating at an all you can eat buffet.\n\nI think this place is very good. I just come here to eat and save some money on my trip to vegas.\n\nThey have a wide variety of food to choose from.\n\nThey even have mongolian grill.\n\nIs just 1.5 miles off the strip.
0,"The customers for this store line up on Liberty Avenue, blocking the\nsidewalk with their chairs and standing in the middle of the sidewalk.\nOnce the store is open all that remains is the mounds of debris left over the \nsidewalk. The store owners do nothing to clean up this mess or to control\ntheir customers, it is an embarrassment to other downtown establishments,\nour customers are subject to the debris and ridiculous behavior of their \ncustomers. I can only imagine the lack of respect this store would have for \nanyone, due to the lack of cleaning up the mess left in front of their \nstore and more importantly othe businesses.\n\nAn upset pedestrian"
0,"I used to love Geno's because the food is good and they deliver but the employees seriously suck at life. The first time I placed an order for delivery the delivery driver had no change and offered to take my money, go to the store, and bring me back my change. The guy looked untrustworthy so I declined his offer. We have had food delivered to our apt several times and today a girl told me they don't deliver to my area. I asked her why they delivered to my apt a week ago and she said if I order $30 worth of food they'll deliver it . I don't know if they don't train their employees well or if they just hire stupid people but I have a feeling its a mixture of both. I called Silver Mine and had no problems. I wouldn't recommed eating here unless you enjoy dealing with idiots."
0,"Most probably the worst Italian food I ever had .....the meatballs they talk so highly about were salty, the pasta was not fresh and tasted like it came out of a package! \nThe sangria was made with frozen fruit not fresh and worst of all I asked for no bacon in my pasta for kosher reasons and the waiter put my plate down and stated no bacon as to which it was covered in bacon and couldn't eat it! \nMy husband went to the manager to complain so he comped the pasta but the manager did not once come to the table to apologize ! Disgusting food and poor management and won't be returning !"
1,"We ate at Firefly on Paradise during our last visit to Las Vegas and decided to try the new downtown location this time.  When we parked the car we were a bit put off because the Plaza hotel is pretty run down.\n\nThe setting of Firefly Bistro, however, is a one of a kind, in an atrium overlooking the downtown light show.\n\nWe had great service (from a Firefly veteran - she said she had been with the restaurant for 5 years) and we enjoyed our choices (bacon-wrapped dates, beef/mushroom kebabs, parmesan frites, chicken salad).  Our only regret was that we had eaten a large lunch (buffets be damned) so weren't too hungry at dinner and couldn't try more items (such as the lemon tarts we had had enjoyed so much on our last visit).\n\nFirefly is a great tapas bar and the kitschy downtown location is worth a visit.  If you can time your visit to see the light show, I would recommend you do so and ask for a view table."
1,"Its close, convenient, and great for anything gaming. Its definately my favorite onestop-gameshop!"
1,"New place that opened up within the past month on the SE side of town, near No. 1 boba, on Silverado Ranch and Eastern. Shop FACES silverado ranch. Same \""building\"" as No 1 boba. \n\nI was told that the ice cream is from San Jose. \n\nThis is not your ordinary ice cream ! Taro has a slight texture where you can feel the \""grainy-ness\"" of the root in the ice cream. Macapuno (young coconut) has actual pieces of young coconut (like what you'd get from inside a young coconut). \n\nThese two are my favorite. Not too sweet. Good flavoring. \n\nGreen tea was a little disappointing. Not too strong in green tea flavor (im a sucker for strong tea flavor hence why i like Cafe Teaze's teas) \n\nHeath Bar Ice cream was good too ! nice to get some good sized bite pieces in the ice cream for you to be surprised by and enjoy :D \n\nCookies and cream is very well made. Cookies throughout and flavored nicely ! \n\nAs i had mentioned in my tip, dont let the prices scare you. They are VERY generous in scoop sizes and you do get your money's worth ! \n\nCloses somewhat early (10pm) but when we went, everyone rushed near closing and created a line XD"
0,Everytime my friends and I see a midnight here there always out of hot dogs and has stale popcorn. Also we seen a baby cockroach crawling on the counter. If there gonna do a midnight they should make sure they have everything ready. I'm paying the same price as everyone else who goes t earlier show.
0,"This is the worst service i have ever had in my life! They were 3 hours late on their delivery time, they gave me an attitude when i called to ask why it was taking so long, THEN she hung up on me! seriously? this is the absolute worst service i have ever had and i wouldn't reccomend them to ANYONE even if they were free!"
1,Davis was so helpful in my practice today. I usually do more stretching classes as I have wrist issues - she (Davis) took time after the class to help me with proper form. \n\nClean nice studio. Look forward to taking more classes!
1,Nice little breakfast place.  \n\nFood is good and made with love.\nThe service is friendly and prompt.\n\nThe place is small and hipster as hell but its pretty much the best breakfast place in the area.
0,"I've ordered their pad thai for take out a couple of times from this place, but last night was the first night that my husband and I decided to go dine in at this place. It was a BIG DISAPPOINTMENT!! The service here is HORRIBLE!! \n\nWe went there around 9pm and was the only couple there besides another group at the place. The other group left shortly after we came, but we never got service after we received our food. We never got asked if we needed anything else and received no water refill. They had 6 staff walking around working and doing their own thing and NOT ONE of them ever even stop to come check on us especially our waitress. When we finally got up to leave she was talking out loud from the far back asking us if everything was okay. I wanted to throw a fit and say.. \""no, everything is not okay we got no service!\"" \n\nAside from the poor customer service; we ordered my favorite dish which was the pad thai. I asked for no onions and bean sprouts, but we still got it with LOTS of big onions and bean sprouts. My husband told me to say something about it; but I figure I would deal w/ it because I'm always iffy about what people do with my food after they take it back and have to fix it for me. It already took about 15 minutes or so for them to bring out the dish and I didn't want to have to wait another 15 minutes. \n\nWe also ordered sticky rice..and I LOVE sticky rice. It took them longer to bring us the sticky rice than the other three dishes that we ordered. The sticky rice was not moist and sticky at all. It was dried and crusty like its been sitting out for too long. I guess they were trying to microwave or steam it before they brought it out, but didn't do a very good job.\n\nWe also ordered the green curry dish; that dish cost $13.95 and came in such a small size plate that should have been worth $7 at the most! Big disappointment on that dish. \n\nSo base on my experience last night; I have concluded that I will NEVER go here again nor will I even bother to order take out from this place. Bangkok Ocha down the street is so much better!"
1,"This arena has seen it all. \nI'm privileged to have been here to see some of my favorite bands here. I'm a big geek so I wont elaborate, but I have had bad seats and really good ones and even some backstage concerts. This is a really large venue that holds about 13 thousand and when its sold out it is so loud!! However, this place is really great because its not as big as some I have been to that hold far more, or the same and don't feel as small. \nPretty easy to get in and out of, and with plenty of restaurants and bars in the MGM, this is always a good night out!"
1,"We are frequent visitors to Las Vegas and stay exclusively at the GN; rooms are clean, staff friendly, great restaurants on property and location is perfect."
0,DO NOT USE 24/7 LOCKSMITH!!!  They quoted me a price and when they came out told me it was going to cost exactly 10 times what they quoted me. The locksmith then has gone on to repeatedly text me very inappropriate things. I cannot stress enough NOT to use this company!
0,"Yes, they're much greener than normal taxis. And yes, they're much easier to flag down at 3am than a black cab. But that's about a far as the list of plus points goes.\n\nThey cost about three times the price of a black cab, and even though there is a certain amount of wiggle room for haggling over the price, it will definitely end up costing you so much you'll probably wish you'd just walked it in the first place - 6 inch heels or not. \n\nThey're pretty much open-air too, despite their little flimsy roofs, so on those (many) Edinburgh nights when there's horizontal sleet falling when you come out of a club, you can expect a face-full of it all the way home. Which will take you three times as long as it would in a normal taxi, because the poor student who has to cycle the thing understandably doesn't have the same power in his legs as a car's engine.\n\nTheir one saving grace? They're great for that one person on any night out who always peaks far too early and needs to go home by midnight. And when I say \""peaks\"" I mean they've puked all over their own shoes and no black cabs will take them, and no-one's offering to walk them home. That's when these pedicabs are a welcome sight, but it's about the only time."
0,"Do not expect anyone to answer your calls ever. They use a phone tree rather than human operator. Today I left the FOURTH MESSAGE either for my Dr. or his PA for medication refill without which will result in no meds starting tomorrow. . This experience is typical over the 18(?) months I've been seen by Dr. West. \n\nWhy do I continue to stay with this practice? I ask myself every time my messages are unreturned. The answer is Vegas is an intellectual desert. Dr. West & his PA are knowledgable about the condition for which I'm treated, both in practice and current research. \n\nThe staff and greeters are lovely in person. Good luck getting a live person to answer or return your calls."

0,"I am sorry, but WAY overpriced. I paid $2.99 for a greek yogurt. It wasn't even a fancy brand. I can get Skyr at Sprouts for cheaper. My bad. I didn't notice the price tag. They do not have the price of items on display. You have to search the product for a price tag. \n\nI looked at prices and in general way too pricey. I guess you are paying for the convenience. I think AJ's Fine Foods is better and less expensive. \n\nNever again."
0,"I'm no strip club connoisseur, but I've gotta say that Treasures was one of the more disappointing \""gentleman's clubs\"" that I've ever been to.  And I've gone to strip clubs in Syracuse, NY!\n\nWe showed up in a large group, so we got limoed in for free.  The set up of the place is just the kind of cheesy that you'd want from a Vegas skin joint.  But the dancers on the stage seemed bored and uninterested, the ones on the floor seemed just plain old desperate to sucker a dude into a private lap dance, and looking around at my compatriots, everyone just seemed kind of bored.  \n\nSo a good chunk of us bailed after a while.  Apparently things did get more... interesting... after that though."
0,"We came in for lunch on a Sunday and it wasn't too crowded. It took quite a while for our drinks to come out. They did bring out bread and olive oil. The fiance ordered a Mediterranean Chicken salad and I got a penne dish with artichokes, chicken, and mushrooms. We were both sorely diappointed with the quality of the food. His salad had a few cold chicken strips on it (the same ones that were on my pasta). The pasta was ok, but it was probably something I could easily make at home. It would have been ok if we paid 5 dollars each, but the salad was 11 and the pasta was 13 bucks! We don't mind paying these prices if the food is good, but what a rip off. This place is way too overpriced for the quality of food. The pizzas looked ok, so maybe that would be the way to go. I wouldn't reccomend this place."
1,"Grimaldi's Grimaldi's.. You have changed the way I view pizzerias forever! \n\nI walk into this location for the first time, I can honestly say it's a mixture of ambiance between The Olive Garden and a typical pizzeria. The moment I walked in I was greeted and seated. The service may be described as polite and respectable. \n\nThe food items ordered were a small pizza and a Mediterranean salad. The pizza had a THIN crust with mostly ingredients being the key volume piece in the pizza. The salad was delicious, fresh and filling. \n\nThank you Grimaldi's for making pizza an eatable food once again without the fear of endless bread enhancers! I no longer feel guilty for eating pizza and PREFER Grimaldi's thin crust over any other pizzeria's pizzas. \n\nGreat service, beautiful location and delicious food, five stars without a doubt :)"
0,"I stayed here for a convention. Nice location but very run down. I had to upgrade after one night because the room was so dirty. My \""view\"" room was awful, the Donny and Marie sign on the windows obstructed the view to the point that it wasn't enjoyable. Had to spend an extra $30 for the view and a coffee maker."
1,"The Outsider is a place that you plan to go to, not simply walk by and stop in. And this is for good reason. The food is excellent. This was the second lunch here for my wife and me. Our first time we had just walked in, and had to wait a bit for a table. This time we took the wisdom to phone ahead for a reservation. \n\nAs you'll read in many of the reviews, The Outsider is a modern restaurant with chic interior and great views of the castle and the Old Town. This contrast in decor and the historical surroundings gives you a feeling almost as if you have travelled from a medieval city into a cosmopolitan restaurant of the future. However, while many of the 'restaurants' within a stone's throw of the castle serve up steak pie, balmoral chicken and fish and chips (all of which I love at the appropriate time), The Outsider focuses more on a Renaissance of the taste buds rather than traditional Scottish fare. \n\nThe wife and I have been highly attracted to the lunch menu prices. A meal and a drink for two would only just push you over the \u00a320 mark. In fact, without drinks, you can eat for just under \u00a315, even with a starter. And when you compare that to other restaurants considered to be more affordable at lunch time, then I think I'll pay a 1 or 2 quid more and have a much better meal. \n\nEach time we have been here the restaurant has 3 specials served 12-7pm added onto the regular lunch menu served 12-5pm. My philosophy is that if one of the specials appears rather appealing, then I'll have that and try a regular menu choice later. I did that again this time and  the duck special with Parmesan mash potatoes, purple broccoli and black pudding, drizzled in a very tasty sort of creamy raspberry sauce. It was really good. If I was a better writer I would describe it in bigger words ;) \n\nWhile I would say that the food and decor were excellent, I was slightly less impressed with the service, and I do mean ever so slightly. The staff are very friendly, don't get me wrong. The two times I have been here we have had servers who spoke fluent english, but, however, they had problems explaining what things were on the menu. In fact our most recent server had to go ask what some of the items were on the regular menu. I feel like any staff at a restaurant should be able to describe and explain exactly what a dish is and what is in it. \n\nIf you're planning an afternoon in Edinburgh, then you should definitely stop here for lunch, especially instead of any of the other well spoken of restaurants even on the same street."
0,A group of four of us went to dinner before a show in the south side. We alerted our server to our time window and she said no problem. Our servers attentiveness was minimal and we didn't require a lot. Our meals were okay but nothing special. When the bills came our prices were different than on the menu and when we asked our server about it she told us that we each had a $3.50 up charge for ordering fried rice rather than the white rice the meals came with. Our server never mentioned the up charge and she asked us which type of rice we would prefer! She was very rude about it in the end and never apologized or anything. We will spend our money elsewhere when we go to the next show.
0,"Thanks to Obamacare, American quality healthcare is about to disappear. The people who own K/E simply pulled the plug and closed. Paul T Emery has been my primary care for over twelve years.A nice guy and a great doctor. As a senior with serious medical conditions to find that I no longer have my doctor is outrageous. Anyone can go bust; anyone can decide they want to close, but to leave patients like me in the lurch with no prior notice is reprehensible.The owners of K/E are assholes. They also have put the well being of many patients at risk. No warning, no records nothing.The office was always poorly run but my concern was with my doctor and his excellent nurse Julie. I was taken care of and so was my wife and one of my daughters.\nIf anyone out there wants to sue these bums.......count me in.\nIf anyone knows where the headquarters of this company is, we ought to go there and camp out in front of their door until they personally hand us our medical records and at no charge. They have been stolen from us.Hope that some attorney reads this."
0,"Offering everything from Chinese food to pizza to burgers, this eatery is good if you need something in a hurry and don't have high expectations.\nQuite frankly, I haven't dared try the Chinese food.  I did have a cheeseburger and shrimp cocktail recently.  The shrimp cocktail, at 99 cents, is a bargain and is much improved over the one I had here years ago.  The burger was over cooked, and I had a fairly long wait to be served with my burger."
1,"This place is fantastic!  I often went to their Ahwatukee location and was so excited when I realized they had another place right by my new address.\nThe location they're in is considered a \""death spot\"" since every restaurant that has tried to make a go of it there has failed.  I can only hope this place catches on because I'll go into a deep depression if they don't make it here.  \nThis is REAL authentic Mexican food and the best I've had anywhere.  I love the street tacos and even the beans are the best I've ever had.\nGo now!!!"
1,"This is my parent's Mexican restaurant of choice. I can see why. The portions are huge and everything is hot, fresh and tasty. \n\nHusband and I shared the crab and shrimp enchiladas, although it was a tough decision to make. Everything looked tempting. The enchiladas were quite good and definitely big enough to share. We both have big appetites but had taken advantage of the chips and salsa and ordered a quest dip for the table. The queso was rich and cheesey, served with flour tortilla chips - although I preferred the corn chips and used those to dip. \n\nIf in the area again I would like to try the pollo rico - I have a serious weakness for jalapeno cream cheese."
1,seriously have the best onion rings i was in heaven!!! service was good food was good i all around loved this place most def going back this weekened!!! truly a gem
1,Real good beer selection. A lot of local brewery beers served in a great location.  Worth the trip.
0,"Stopped in here for a beer and snack after a bike ride on the first nice spring day this year. Was hoping they would have the marzen on tap since it was March. No marzen on tap, they were still serving the February beer at the end if march, my half liter had a good inch plus of head, so did every other beer I watched the bartender pour. This is a beerhouse, you'd think they would know how to pour a beer. On top if that the beer wasn't even cold, just slightly lower than room temp. The pretzels I got were about on par with those frozen soft pretzels you can buy at the grocery store. I paid $10 for the pretzels and $5 for the half liter. Penn brewery is much better than this place, if you want a good German beer house experience go there. This place is more of a German themed Applebee's, if that."
1,"If you like sushi and your dining partner does not, this is an awesome place that has great options for both!  Lunch prices are super reasonable!!"
0,"I think most would agree, the reason for eating at a chain restaurant is \""consistency!\""  Unfortunately, this location doesn't get it.  With them, \""life IS like a box of chocolates...\""  The food is edible to bad, the bartenders couldn't produce two identical Bloody Mary's if their lives depended on it, the waiters don't know whether to stand or crouch to take orders, your table is never cleared regardless how full of dishes, and worst of all - you are either \""Dude or Hon!\""  Stay home!  Don't go!  If you live in the area and need a late night bite, there's a Denny's about one-half mile west on Chandler Blvd.  Yes, I know Denny's isn't the best either - but breakfast for dinner is never bad!"
0,"...Food does not taste good, wait for a long time, I dont  want back again..."
0,"Sage has become our sushi place, that is until tonight.  We ordered 2 AYCE and one Deluxe Tempura Platter.  The sushi was not nearly as good as it has been in our past visits.  The rice was overly sticky.  A number of the rolls that we ordered were fair at best, not even considering the rice.  We had an assortment of leftover pieces from those rolls that weren't good - and they wanted to charge us .50 for each piece.  If it were good, it would have been eaten.  I let it be known that an added fee would be completely offset by the tip.  I was told they didn't care.  The owner, Mary, was very rude, and made a few whispered remarks.  When I questioned what she said, I was told \""nothing\"".  (There was no additional charge)  We had to wait a full 20 minutes to get the bill - and that included asking every server.  Another 10 minutes before someone would take the payment.  Our stamped card for a free dinner was almost filled up, but we ripped it up before we left.  Bummer!"
1,"Absolutely the best brewery in Arizona. The beer selection is superb. 8th street ale is amazing-- along with the blonde beer. \n\nBurgers, chicken tenders, and beer bread sandwiches are top notch. \n\nThe atmosphere is always lively here-- during the cooler months, the patio is perfect!"
0,"I will be going back to Petsmart...First off, the girl at the front desk with the blue eyeshadow was HORRIBLE at talking to customers-made the entire encounter really awkward and uncomfortable. Cash only business-which I find odd, but okay. They did not call me when my dogs were done, instead I called them 4 hours after I dropped my dogs off to find out what the deal was and blue eyeshadow girl told me that she had already called me and they had been done for a while-Ummm no you didn't call me, and if you did-why would you not leave a message? Yep, she was lying. In the places's defense-the blonde girl in the back doing the grooming was really nice and my dogs came back super soft, although instead of just trimming up my pom's butt-they totally shaved it and I am stuck seeing his little butthole all the time until his hair grows back a little. I would not go back. Bottom line: Decent groom-BAD customer service up front."
0,"We used to have a storage unit with Storage Max.  Storage Max has an EXTREMELY rude staff, from our experience.  They do not accept credit cards and will only accept checks or cash.  So do not even think of setting up an automatic payment plan.  Also be aware that your belongings may be exposed to some dust from dust storms, as ours were.  Which never happened in our previous experiences from renting storage units.\n\nThe prices are the cheapest you can find in Scottsdale, and the saying was true to us, remember, you get what you pay for."
1,"I love this theatre not a bad seat In the house we saw Lisa lampenelli and she was amazing!! I like the fact they have cocktail waitresses so you don't have to leave your seat which is very annoying to have to all get up because someone needs to leave their seat and get by, this prevents this."
0,"Read below the line of this post & you'll see my prior post.  I am a regular, or was a regular now!\n\nI never come in on Monday's,  I usually come in on Friday or Saturday.  This is the first time I ever met Bale.  I normally get served by Sarah & Jenn (who are the best & I like dearly).  \n\nThis night, Sarah served my first beer.  When Sarah went on break my beer was empty and I set my glass on the edge of the bar so the bartender knows I am ready for another.  Keep in mind, I am by myself at the end of the bar.  I see her look at my glass and walk away at least two times to serve others at the other end of the bar.  The third time I wave her down and she doesn't even give me a \""I'm sorry I will be right with you\"" (recognition of some sort).  So I do something I never done before and that is poor my own beer.  Now, I got her attention! After explaining to her why I did what I did (the fact that she was deliberately ignoring me), Sarah comes back from her break, and I explain what happened.  Sarah knows me and was very nice about her reasons of having to kick me out.  It is illegal to pour your own beer, now I admit, I was not thinking about that at the time, yet I am glad that happened just to prove a point.  It took me doing something like that to get Bale's attention, what does that say about a person like that.\n\nIn conclusion, I was told I can come back another night, but because of my action Sarah had to ask me to leave, I want to note that Sarah has always given me great service.  However, because of one person, Bale, I will not be coming back to this bar.  I have more class than that, to let someone treat me like I am nothing, when I am a consistent customer.  The sad thing about Bale, it is people like her that leave me hopeless in seeing this local economy thrive again.  I moved back to this neighborhood to support this area, yet people like her have made me decide to move back close to my job in downtown Phoenix  Everyone has to understand, I grew up in this area.  If you're a native like me, you'll understand, if not, you probably will not care.  The bottom line is thanks to the internet consumers like me have a voice.  Bale has got to go!\n\n\n\n\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nLove this place.\n\nGreat dive bar, the bar tenders are really nice, they have the tall boy beers I like & mini pitchers for a good price.  \n\nI was impressed how much a crowd this place can draw in."
0,"Well I'm reviewing this place and I have not even had the opportunity to work out there. I called to get some info on pricing and classes. I HATE GYMS for a couple reasons. 1. I don't use work out equipment I join only for the classes 2. I don't like the pressure you get to buy a better package or a trainer. I don't want any of that. 3. Some gyms are clean and some are not. I called because this location was close to my house. The guy on the phone was rude. I asked at least 5 different times and he literally would not give me any pricing over the phone. Not a range or anything. We started going back and forth telling me I need to come in and speak with him. Finally, after asking to speak with a manager and him telling me he was at lunch....I told him that the impression I've got over the phone was no good and I didn't know if I wanted to come in now...he said oh ok well I can tell you our packages start around $19.99 a month. How hard was that?! He didn't say bye he literally hung up. Wow exceptional customer service, makes me really want to come frequent your gym... NOT!!!!!"
1,Very good cabeza tacos and carne Asada fries. Definitely coming here again. Not that bad on price too.
0,I had higher hopes for this place. They screwed my order up twice and the only modifications I asked for were no onions and black beans instead of refried. While I caught the black beans before I left I didn't the onions and it was loaded....ones that couldn't be picked out and were loaded in the burrito. For the $9 I spent it wasn't worth it at all. I will continue to keep driving by but I definitely wont be stopping anymore.
1,"This is the best club I have EVER been to. It's really open so you don't get hot like at other clubs. It has multiple bars indoor and outdoor and great music. The atmosphere is beautiful-high ceilings, a huge pool and a good sized dance floor. \nThis place is a guaranteed good time!"
0,"Not sure if I should even write a review, but I did try to attend and was so annoyed even trying to park I left.  Thought I should at least let others know of my experience.  I purchased 2 for 1 tickets online from Voice Daily Deals (New Times) online.  I wasn't thinking it was going to be crowded so we ended up going around lunchtime to drop in and be able to sample different trucks food.  Lines started a couple of blocks in our car away from the event just to get into the parking lot.   After making it near the fields where the event was after 20 minutes still in line.  I saw the huge amounts of lines of hundreds of people waiting in the lines through the chain link fence.  After sitting still in the parking lot line waiting to park for another 10 minutes got to thinking that we probably wouldn't be able to eat for another hour or so if we are lucky at that.  My husband and I voted against waiting in line that long to eat so we made a u turn from the line and ended up handing our printed ticket to a couple that was walking towards the event.  Ended up eating elsewhere and was served right away.  I won't be going back for this event after reading the reviews posted here, glad I made the executive decision of taking off before getting in the door."
1,"Are you kidding me?  This place is the best.  Healthy, tasty, good food that wont kill you."
0,"Is this my first bad review? Oh no. I was hoping that throughout my entire Yelp Career that I wouldn't experience a place I haven't liked. But the time has come my friends and it has hit like a hurricane.\n\nI came here after a long day of studying. All I wanted some crazy bread. I had a coupon that said I could get them for $1.99 and I went there with the intention. I walked in, it look moderately busy. It was a Saturday night and weekends are usually the prime time for pizza consumption. I didn't even want pizza. \n\nI walked in and I wasn't greeted with a smile. As a matter of fact, I was greeted at all. I stood there while the cashier was just standing around. I finally built the confidence to say hello. I let out a nice sounding \""hello,\"" well I think it was nice. The cashier was uninterested and basically asked me what I would like to order like it was a burden. I felt the awkwardness and told her my order, she obliged and took my payment with so much enthusiasm, that is sarcasm by the way. She basically threw my crazy bread and sauce into the bag and handed me it without even giving me much eye contact. I left without a word and moved on.\n\nAt least the crazy bread was good.\n\nBut that's it."
1,"Order anything... it's great.\n\nI have been there many times over the years.  It is my favorite steakhouse, second only to Pappas Brothers in Houston, now that Ben Benson's in NY is closed."
1,"My husband and I planned to eat at Spoon as our one fancy meal during a recent trip to Pittsburgh, and we were not disappointed.  The servers were very attentive and did everything possible to make our experience memorable, and the food was wonderful.  I started with the blue cheese gorgonzola souffle, which right now is being served with a stone fruit salad.  (Mine was almost all peaches with a few plum slices.)  By itself the souffle would have been too overpowering, but alternated with bites of the salad, it made for a very balanced dish.  My main course was chicken two ways, which has been described here by others, so I'll just say that it was a wonderful choice and surprisingly filling.  For dessert, I had peach-sage sorbet, which was divine!\n\nMy husband is never quite as sure of himself in a fancy place like this, but he had a very good experience as well.  He started with the prawns and cantaloupe, which he liked very much (although he was a little freaked out that the prawns were served entire).  Next, he had the barbecued brisket, which was served with white cheddar mac 'n cheese and coleslaw.  He thought the coleslaw, which contained red peppers and several other unusual vegetables, was a little strange, but he ate it all, and he thought the other components of the entree were very good.  For dessert, he had brown sugar-cinnamon ice cream.  It was a little bland for my taste, but he enjoyed it very much.\n\nI doubt we'll ever have the opportunity to dine at Spoon again, but it was a memorable meal and worth every penny."
1,I had a mani- pedi here today. I was a bit nervous because of bad reviews but it was not bad. Not 5 star- maybe 3.5. Very clean and nice salon. Limited polish selection. Pedi better than mani. I'll go back again in a crunch.
0,"If the US Post Office goes away, it will be because the service is nonexistent. Friendly enough people, just slow. Understaffed and slow as (choose your own analogy). No sense of urgency or services like you might find at FedEx or UPS. Came here on a Saturday for a passport renewal. Arrived at 11:00 AM. Still waiting at 12:30. Upon arrival there were several other passport customers ahead of us. The crazy part, they did not have someone working passports the whole time. They seemed to be trying to juggle the mailing & shipping responsibilities with the passport services. Sure it's an hour and a half, but it \""feels\"" longer every time no one works the passport services and more passport customers arrive. My recommendation to you the reader of this review; fly into San Francisco and go to the proper Passport Services. You might save some energy."
1,Joe has been taking care of all of my isnsurance needs for many years and his staff has done a great job notifying me ahead of time when something is overdue to avoid any issues. Thnak you Joe!
0,"Only go here if you're desperate. That was the only reason why we went there (we heard from word-of-mouth that you don't need a male escort to come here) I understood that the security guards needed to give us a hard time for being two straight women wanting to watch other women dance (and taking business away from them), but that didn't even compare to the quality of girls that Wednesday night, sleazy-brothelesque atmosphere, and rude pimp/DJ openly reprimanding the girls over the loud-speaker. \n\nThe more appealing and talented girls were hard to find, and Sapphire's was just interesting enough for us to stay a couple of hours. It was a disappointing experience for me since I've been to a more posh gentleman's club in SF. Next time I'll just make the effort and go to the Rhino, which you should too!"
0,"Hard rice, oversalted steak and a limited menu -- what more could you ask for? :-/\n\nI ate at the bar, and my bartender was friendly and efficient ... no bad-service reports here. \n\nBut this is a restaurant last I checked, and I'm amazed at how they're able to get away with such bad food. Oh, yes, that's right. It's because this terminal has no other options!"
1,"This place is close to my house so I love it.  I also like the convenience of having a decent selection restaurants right in the same parking lot.  Great place if you want to take the family to dinner and a movie.  Inside the place is clean and they have plenty of people at the window and also a few automated ticket kiosks which are nice.  The seating is nice and the sound quality is great.  They have a larger theater for the \""hot\"" movies and it works great if you want to see something in 3D."
1,"While passing through Las Vegas, on our way to Reno, we stopped into this cute juice bar with some really cool bicycles in front. Since we had been driving all day, the nice lady behind the counter recommended a couple of 1 oz. wheat grass shots to give us more energy for the rest of our journey. She took great care to run the wheat grass through the juicer a few times to be sure she got every drop of juice out! I've had wheatgrass before but I don't remember it being this sweet. I don't know where they source theirs from but it was probably the best I've had. \n\nWe also got a couple of their fresh juices. One with a green base of kale, spinach, cucumbers and ginger. The other had a beet base with ginger and other fruits. They were both really good and refreshing. Even my kids liked them. We didn't try their food since we were on a pretty tight travel schedule but we will definitely be back the next time we come to Vegas!"
1,Located near Ross. Soo true about the decor looking like the 80s threw up in there. Bar with fireside pit accompanied by water. The restaurant itself has the whole diner vibe going on. While waiting for 50 mins we drank some mimosas (tasty) :D doesn't disappoint. The french toast collage was good but nothing out of the norm. The swiss and mushroom burger was huge and it was quite juicy. The waitress we had was friendly and prompt. Theres a little jar that has colorful sugar crystals on the table. The bacon was so crunchy and it was good quality bacon lol. Not that cheap clear bacon. Eggs were ordered over well and they got it just right! Definitely a must try when visiting Vegas!\n\nOh and btw they take and give you a complimentary picture :D
1,"Happy hour is designed to make one happy. The fact they had one sat evening with things I like on it made me happy for a new hours.\n\nThere are a few 1/2 priced sushi rolls like a Spicy tuna and Phily roll. 1/2 some apps and beer $3 specials. \n\nThe rolls are regularly 7.50 ish so 3.50 on happy hour, as for quality it was decent however with a spicy tuna or Phily roll it is hard to really mess them up. The added avacado to them was nice.\n\nWe also had a veggie spring roll $3.50 Then 1/2 off for happy hour.  A soft rice noodle skin around fresh veggies sushi rice and peanut sauce. It was great like Vietnam meets Thailand.\n\nThey were nice enough to turn down the loud music for us make it a pleasant place to be, the curtains are cool and the beer selection included some micro brews. Not bad at all."
0,"Stopped in here after refusing to wait for Guadalajara and Gallo blancos wait times on a labor day weekend. We tried this place after passing by it twice. What the hell why not. Got inside and the atmosphere was less than desirable, felt like I was at work in a warehouse with shitty ventilation. Chips and salsa arrived, half chips half crumbs, and the salsa appeared to be a bowl of canned stewed tomatos, which in my mind trying to figure out how to dip this chip into this thick salsa that looks like it's just chunks of tomato. So the entrees come and our waitress as serving us spills hot water off one of the plates on my girl, and doesn't come back with any towel or ice, while my girl believes it was accidental, I think waitress did it on purpose because my girl appears to be a snobby bitch all the time. (She can't help it, it's just the way she comes off)  so while enjoying our entrees, yup I said enjoying, it wasn't all bad food was okay except the enchiladas, the tortillas seemed stale like the plate was made 2 days ago and reheated just for me. The ticker was when were watching the game 2 angry roaches came out of no where fussing and arguing about who was gonna win the game, not bugging any one else while they did their debate (ha I said not bugging any one) my girl whose got a serious disgust and fear of roaches fled the restaurant and waited in the car on this 100+  degree that day. Cashier was curious about the situation and took care of us otherwise after explaining what happened. That would be my last time visiting, wondering what the roaches do while they aren't fighting over sports, probably using huge chunks of tomatos to float on in the thick salsa to keep cool while inside."
0,"Called in an order for lunch. The gal on the phone wasn't very friendly but understood my order just fine :)\n\nOrdered the fried mushrooms and a falafal pita. Went to pick up the order, two gals were in the cook area. Again, no one oozed a whole lotta friendliness or customer service abilities. Was almost $11 for the two items. \n\nThe pita was ho-hum. Maybe I'm just spoiled but the pita tasted store bought and not very soft or fluffy. The falafal was was a bit on the dry side and too salty. The fried mushrooms were kinda icky :(. Tasted like a frozen item that was fried thick until the outside is HARD and can make knocking sounds. Their cucumber sauce was not too bad but REALLY thick but had a nice cucumber flavor and the ONLY thing I got that in any way resembled homemade. \n\nFor my lunch, I think I will stick with the $7 lunch specials from Eden's Grill, ty very much. :/\n\nNow if I could just get over the fried food coma  O.o"
0,"Frankly, I am very surprised to see all of these good reviews about this place as my experience here was quite the opposite. My car was pulling to the right, and the check engine light was on so I took it there and they told me my car needed intake manifold gaskets, and lower control arm bushings. they said the check engine light didn't have any codes so there was nothing wrong with that, and I could bring the car back the next morning because they needed to order the parts, and they could have it ready by noon. I dropped the car off in the morning, and since they didn't bother to call me I came back at noon. guess what? It wasn't ready..I asked how is my car doing and he said \""oh great we have it all torn down, it should be ready by 3 oclock. ok I came back at 3 because again they never bothered to call and tell me it would not be ready when they said it would be ready. It still was not done until 5PM.. I figured well ok stuff happens no big deal.\n  Then a few days later I noticed the engine was smoking and I smelled oil burning, so I took it back. They said they didn't get the gasket on right and they would fix it for free. then a few days later I noticed a loud metal noise when I go over bumps like something was loose under the car, and again the check engine light was on, so I took it back again, and they said I needed the lower control arm replaced because they only replaced the bushing to try to save me money, so I had to pay another $300.00 on top of the original $1500.00 I just spent. oh well just get it fixed I don't want to have to worry about it.they still didn't know why the check engine light was back on again, so they reset it for free. wow that was very nice of them ya know..they never called me once not once and it was never ready when they said it would be ready.\n  a week later the check engine light was on AGAIN so I came back, and they said I needed a new gas cap, and also the reason the car is pulling is because I need new rear brakes, so this cost me another $400.00 to fix.\n  Then a month or so later it was leaking oil AGAIN so I took it back AGAIN. now they say I need a new oil pan gasket, and this will cost $550.00. and I could drop it off and pick it up by noon the next day. This time I learned my lesson so I waited until 1PM to call them and guess what it wasn't ready, they said it would be ready in a couple of hours.no call from them so I went there and they apologized and said they would get me a rental car for free. ok they got me a rental car, and I picked up my car on Saturday and left the rental car with them. then the rental company charged me $200.00 for car rental! they said they have no free rental agreement with superior tire, they just gave me the discount they get. FREE? NOT! they also said I rented the car for 3 days not just 1 day, because the car sat on the lot until Monday before they returned it so I had to pay for 2 extra days.\n\nat this point I was pretty fed up so I posted a review here on Yelp about it, and the district manager, Shane called me and said he would take care of everything, and refund my rental car fees if I took the post down. I agreed and he did get my money back to me, and offered to have another store look at my car, as I explained to him the bad service here. Thanks but no thanks. now guess what the car is now leaking oil AGAIN, worse than before, and it STILL pulls to the right. so all in all I went there 8 times, spent over $3000.00 and all I got was a shiny new gas cap. I called Shane again and told him this car still leaks oil and he did offer to have another store look at it but you know what? Id rather take it someplace else even if I have to pay to have the work done again, at least that way it might actually get fixed right, and I might even get a phone call from them to let me know when my car will be ready.\nand one final note, shane said they probably were very busy, and didn't have time to call me, but you know what? they didn't look busy to me when I was there, they were playing video games on an Ipad.....be warned do not take your car to these guys!"
1,"Between me and NYC this is the nearest Dunkin Donuts around and god bless them for that.\n\nMy husband and I travel to Las Vegas several times a year and during our stay in the summer of 2009 was fortunate enough to see that they had finally opened. Joy!\n\nSure you can get their coffee beans from the market, grind and brew them yourself but nothing sure beats pulling up to an actual location, ordering your coffee and donut and savoring it then and there. Now if only they'd open up locations in Cali."
1,"After moving to Bay Area for almost a year, I still miss Thai Basil, definitely the best Thai place in Madison. The red, yellow curry and Tom Yum Soup are all really good and takeout order usually just takes 10 minutes to get prepared, which is super fast. Simply put, you can't go wrong with any item on the menu."
0,I was given a dirty look when I asked about the sanitation of the instruments. And the lady was obviously talking about me in front of the customers in her native language.  She was extremely defensive when I simply asked about that sanitation.  I've seen a few times the workers arguing with customers\nright in plain sight of everybody. So thats why go across  the street to Santan nails it's wonderful!!
0,"Really disappointed in my customer service. \nI came in needing a shellac manicure. I had some leftover polish from a previous shellac manicure that needed to be soaked off. \n\nI came in and there was only one other customer  who walked in about the same time needing a pedicure.\n\nI sat down and my technician (I believe the owner) asked how I was. I told her I was very stressed and busy with finals and just needed a quick break. She put the acetone on my nails and then another customer walked in needing a shellac fill. \n\nThe owner then left me and went to help this other customer. I assumed it would just be a temporary thing, take that customers nail polish off and come back over to finish my nails since I was there first. \n\n50 minutes later, the first customer I walked in with finished her pedicure, and that nail technician finally came over to me. \n\n15 minutes later, the customer needing a full was done and the owner decided to come back to me.\n\nI sat down in the chair at 5:15 and was not finished until 6:55. \n\nWhat I came in for was a standard 45 minute manicure as a study break. \n\nInstead, I was left sitting in a chair, with foil wrapped around my fingers, unable to do anything for 50 minutes, while another customer, who arrived after me, received full attention and service. \n\nSo disappointed in this customer service tonight. \nMoral of the story IF YOU HAVE ANY TIME CONSTRAINTS, DO NOT COME HERE. \n\nIf you have all the time in the world, then sure. But if you are expecting to get in and out in under an hour for a standard service, go elsewhere."
0,"The good:\nVery friendly and warm service\nLamb has great flavor\nBread is fluffy and warm and amazing\n\nThe bad:\nLamb was super fatty.  I had to remove half of the meat because it was all gristle and uck.  From all the other positive reviews I'm guessing I just got the blubbery ends, but it's the blubbery ends I got, so else can I review?"
0,"I had not been in this place in a while and decided to try it with my boyfriend. We sat down and waited and then waited for a waitress to take our drink order. However, there were plenty of people at the bar and managing other projects that obviously worked there. No one bothered to help with customer service. \nWe got the 1 beer and water and while we waited again for a very long time to order we decided to try some place else. The beer on tap was lukewarm."
0,"I don't know where to start with this place. I have stayed here before (many, many years ago) and didn't remember anything bad about this place, so I gave it another chance. With the price, decent location, and decent reviews my boyfriend and I chose to stay here for 3 nights. The only thing that I liked was the aroma of the lobby area. Other then that... I did NOT enjoy my stay here. The (first) room was decent but the walls must have been made out of paper. We could hear the next rooms conversations, toilet flush, and shower turn on and off. So we talked to the front desk, in which they moved us to another room. The second room was on a higher floor, had a better strip view, and looked more elegant but every time we would wash our face, brush our teeth or use the sink in general... IT WOULD LEAK UNDERNEATH. I could feel it splatter on the floor/my feet. We did not want to have to move again so we dealt with it. I don't know what was up with the sheets either. They must not use stain remover when they clean them, because there looked to be left over stains on them, which was disgusting. Again sounds were an issue. With the neighbors and even a loud banging coming from above us... which sounded like construction. The casino in this hotel is SUPER small. The thing that really threw me over the edge was when we decided to try to stay another night, we called the front desk and they were nothing but RUDE. They were not helpful at all. I would think that since we already were there 3 nights, and lost a ton of money in their casino they would try to work something out for us to stay. BUT NOPE. next time I will choose a better hotel to stay at, with more of a central location on the strip. In my opinion... don't stay at the Monte Carlo."
1,"Phoenix City Grille is a great place for family and friends. Despite the draw back of being in a strip mall, the ambiance inside is very warm and welcoming. Instantly you will get the urge to enjoy a cocktail or in my case a Martini. PCG only gets better with the food. Classic comfort foods with a little southwest twist. The Griddle Corn Cakes were fantastic. You can definitely order that appetizer as an entree. I had the green chile burger and it was delicious. I don't think you could go wrong with any of the dishes on this menu. We will be back soon and often."
1,Very unique fusion restaurant.  Got to try many things I have never had before and combinations I never thought would work but were excellent.
1,"Excellent spot for beer, grub and the game."
1,"lime mint beef, sugar cane, bacon wrapped okra, red curry tofu with rice.\n\nall of it, awesome.\n\nactually; it was a love affair. we were sweating."
1,"Fine selection of spirits, okay selection of beer, inside is very cool. All and all, definitely worth a stop to wet your whistle."
1,"I've stayed here a few times.  Always consistent. Service, rooms, restaurants and casino are all A+.  We had a lame experience at Sea Blue but that was it."
1,"The best Mexican Shrimp Cocktail ever. Small place. However, no wait time here like the other Mexican seafood places in town and no live and loud music here. Come alone or come on a date. Not fancy but just plain good neighborhood place."
0,"Very great pizza and other food, but they dont give silverware on their deliveries.  Otherside would have been a 5-star review"
0,"HATE THE WAY THEY THREADED MY EYEBROWS! \n\nThe WORST threading experience ever and I have experienced a bad one but this takes the cake. Wish I could give a ZERO rating. A one star is just enough for the nice atmosphere.\n\nBUT IN NO WAY COMING BACK!\n\nI don't post pictures but I had to. Just look at my pictures of my before and after. Just utterly horrendous. Thank god my eyebrows grow pretty fast but ugh, I actually hate looking myself in the mirror and it makes me cry. I haven't had thin eyebrows like these, EVER. Even my eyebrows back in high school when I went tweezer happy weren't even this thin!\n\nNot only that, I have to wake up early for next damn month or so to fill in my eyebrows in order to be somewhat happy with my face.\n\nI thought it would be a good place because it is right next to my school and my classmates go there but no, never again.\n\nI told the lady I do NOT want an arch or skinny eyebrows because I love my full shape despite my thin hairs. I wanted my shape to be cleaned up because of the excess hairs growing.\n\nApparently her \""okay\"" meant for her to create her idealistic view of what my eyebrows should be which is ugly, skinny brows that happen to be UNEVEN. I mean, if you are going to mess up eyebrows, at least make them even. \n\nI paid and tipped her (because she was nice) but I wish I did not. She needs to learn to LISTEN and LOOK at the fact that I slightly filled in my eyebrows. All she had to do was thread around them. How about thread slowly and then show what you are doing and ask the customer if they like it and then continue?\n\nTo the owner, please teach the older woman who did my eyebrows or maybe to the rest of your staff the essence of listening to a customer and how to really do eyebrows. I felt like she was an inexperienced person! \n\nShe did not deserve my money but I am too kind-hearted that instead of creating a scene I paid and left. She really made me angry when she said that they looked \""good.\"" \n\nYou can only image the amount of obscene words I used in my car on my way home and every time I look in the mirror.\n\nShould have listened to that one review about how they made her thick full eyebrows thin because I left home really unhappy. I wonder if we happened to get the same lady. Ugh.\n\nI really hate being negative but my self-esteem went DOWN because of this situation.\n\nIf you have thick and full eyebrows that are easy to thread that I guess you can go.\n\nRegardless, never again and will not recommend."
0,"i dont even know where to start. THE SERVICE OR THE FOOD!!! OMG, service sucked and the food was disgusting. I walked through the front door and the chef and servers were just staring at me for 2 minutes before i even got greeted with a hello or how may i help you? Then we get seated and it was another 5 minutes before someone came and asked for our drink order. NOT TO MENTION..... this was during SLOW HOURS... it was 4:30pm in the afternoon.... the only customers at the restaurant besides us was another table of 2 sitting 3 tables down from me. We finally got a chance to order after 8-10 minutes. I ordered the chicken satay & green curry with beef and vegetables. The chicken satay lacked flavor and marinate but the peanut dipping sauce that came with it was actually decent... but they only gave you a tablespoon amount for 4 skewers of chicken. The beef green curry arrived and i was disappointed by the flavor. It was watery and it lacked curry flavor... and the veggies weren't even cooked completely. \n....anyways... i wont be coming back. the food was too pricey for the crappy service and poor quality food. I'll rather go to Archi's or Thai noodle house down the street!!"
1,"Not Bad sushi...very cool decor, a little too air conditioned...Definately a young good looking college crowd...and then us late 20 and 30 somethings..\n\nA group of 12 of us went in tonight, a Tuesday, (we are all out of towners just here for work) and we got a table and served relatively quickly. \n\nWe ordered the Tuna Tar Tar, Spicy Tuna Roll, Rainbow Roll and some Nigiri...all I like is the Maguro combo's and they were great, nothing special, but tasty. At the other end of the table they got these deep fried rolls with cream cheese and all that I don't consider real sushi, they were probably good but I didn't try them.\n\nThe prices are ok, the 3 of us with all our sushi and $3.25 Miso soups and a few beers was only $77, maybe I'm just used to paying more in the San Fran area that I live... \n\nThe best part was the T-shirts all the waitresses wear..they say\n\n\""Will you still _____ me in the morning.\"" ....I guess you fill in the blank."
0,"Granted it's a dive campus bar but been frequenting them for half price burgers on Tuesday. Food was pretty good, loved the Mac and cheese as an upgrade. However today's visit had a special friend attend with us. Spotted a cockroach crawling on the wall. So much for the green health inspection sign on the door! Needless to say we won't be back anytime soon."
0,"I like Pei Wei as I always know what to expect. However, this is the second time that I have placed a to go order and waited double the time I was told over the phone. This time I was told the order would take 15 minutes over the phone and I waited over 30 minutes. I would have received the food faster had I dined in. I saw multiple people arrive after me after who dined in. They were eating or leaving as I was barely getting my to go order. I had a simple order of fried rice, chicken Pei Wei, and California rolls.  I'm appalled!!! I didn't even receive an apology. When I asked why I waited so long I was told a cook was missing. If that were the case then those who arrived after me that dined in should still be waiting and not leaving, as I barely received my food!!!!"
0,"The food is So So, but my husband and a coworker got the Oysters to start with  and the two of them ended up with food poisoning!  \n\nThe vegetarain options on their set menu are not great.  Their risotto was not cooked enough, i know risotto is supposed to have bite, but this was ridiculous i was chewing forever!  \n\nThis year i told the company not to bring us back here! Maybe I will go to Sirio instead... so much better!"
0,"If you are starving between flights and only have time to grab from their to-go cooler, don't bother stopping.  No one working the stand and the bartender refused to ring me up.  To the male bartender who was unnecessarily rude--acting like something is not part of your job is never the right response to a customer.  If you don't like being a restaurant employee, that's on you and it's no one else's problem.  Please don't take it out on the people who want to spend money at your establishment."
1,"This place is great. Nice coffee shop atmosphere and really good organic food, coffee and tea. A must go to anyone looking for quality organic and vegan beverages and food. The staff is also really nice and helpful. Highly recommend it!!!!"
0,"Very disappointed at this place. The place itself is very nice and the whole prepping of the scrubs there is kind of cool BUT overpriced and the actual product is below average quality. I got a gel manicure yesterday, along with a sugar scrub and a lotion. Manicure was not done good. First of all they don't soak your nails in water, so your skin doesn't even soften. Besides that, I noticed they only leave your nails under the light for 15seconds. According to the girl it's because is \""better\"" than the standard ones. Don't know if that is BS or not but I already have a nail chipped, this is the worst manicure I've ever had and is expensive. One star for the actual place being nice."
1,"I have not found a good, authentic Chinese restaurant, but when I tried this place with some family members...how should I say this...I saw a clearing (after a search for decent Chinese food) hehehe...\n\nWe ordered their Hong Kong Style Chow Mein, Tofu & Eggplant w/ Shrimp Sauce, a Chilean Sea Bass dish, and my fave....their Crispy House Chicken! I was actually impressed with their quality of food. Service was pretty good, but they took a while to give us our tab after it got busy (I guess that's good that they don't rush you!). \n\nI will be eating here more often now that this place has been discovered....(maybe I should just venture down Spring Mountain more often!)"
1,"Oh Bev Mo how I miss you!!!\n\nI used to live five minutes from this location and would shop here at least once a week.\n\nBev Mo is an alcoholics paradise! They stock hard to find beers and wines that you won't find at most liquor stores. \n\nNow that I'm living in Central PHX I'm at least 15 minutes away from the nearest Bev Mo, so now I have to resort crappy, over priced liquor stores.\n\nI have always found the prices at Bev Mo to be great and cheaper than you can get at the grocery store or liquor store.  They have an excellent selection of booze."
1,"We are new to the area and had a week and a half vacation planned overseas. Until this vacation, we had only left our dog with family members and were very nervous about finding the right place to board him. I checked out a couple other places in Gilbert and left each feeling worse that when I entered. Neither had on-site staff overnight. All the dogs slept locked in their own kennels. I just kept thinking, \""what if there was a fire?\"" It was terrible.\nIf you love and treat your dog like a family member, Gilbert Dogs is the place to go. We brought him to day care a few times before the trip and he gets groomed there, too. They always remember us and are so welcoming and friendly. It made me feel a lot better leaving him for 10 days. They post photos and videos on their Facebook page so you can check out your dog while you're away. We posted on their Facebook wall while on vacation to see how our dog was and they posted right back letting us know he was doing well. They even gave us a report of all his activities over the week and a half. They're the only place I would leave him if we go away in the future."
0,"Has Mammas changed ownership recently?\n\n\n Got a delivery at the weekend and the first thing I noticed was that it arrived in a generic box as opposed to a Mammas box. What was inside was just as generic (and soggy) and nothing like the Mammas pizzas I remember from the past.\n\n\n On the phone I was asked if I wanted spicy or mild but that didn't seem to translate to much on the plate. They may as well have asked if I wanted bland or blander.\n\n\n As for the Buffalo wings coated in Mammas secret spicy recipe and served with your choice of sauces, I think they may have waived a some BBQ sauce nearby but three of the wings didn;t even have any sauce on them. If they were coated in some secret spicy recipe I think the secret will be safe for a while.\n\n\n I used to like Mammas but will probably be taking my custom elsewhere in future. The one star is for the quick delivery."
0,"So needed a massage and decided to check out Massage Envy.  I have a few friends that are members and love it.  Not ready to become a member, I went in just wanting a good massage and willing to pay for their service.  The location is clean and the rooms are small..bright light, music in the background..nothing to make the experience memorable or a calming Zen moment.  The staff was nice however, did not seem to care either way who was coming in and out. \n\nMy massage was less than great.  The first 30 minutes, he \""aligned\"" my back with pressure or what I would call \""lets place my hands on her back ..tap certain areas...push in certain areas for 30 minutes..do nothing else\"" ..no lotion on his hands and when he rubbed I could feel it.  I kept thinking..I hope it gets better cause this is what I'm paying for?  \n\nThe second 30 minutes, it was fast rubbing on my back, legs and feet.  At least he was using oils or lotion!  I felt somewhat relaxed for a short time however, was probably the worst experience I've ever had.   Would I recommend Massage Envy, no.  I'm not envious of those that pay month after month to be a member and still have to have pay for each session At least I only paid $39 because if I paid what I thought I would pay I would be really upset."
0,"Worst experience for a first timer, which just made me a last timer. I will never go back to this place. They couldn't get any of my orders right. I ordered 2 Salmon sandwiches, ended up with only one, but was charged for 2. Then I thought a coffee sounded good, they got one of them but forgot mine, so after I reminded them, they couldn't grasp what a blended decaf peppermint mocha was. Once I tasted it I sent it right back and asked for my $ back. I wouldn't recommend this place to ANYONE."
0,"I love Toby Keith but if he is in anyway associated to this place you better rethink it. I came in just after one today maybe 35-40 people in the bar, but the place is very big after being told we could sit wherever we wanted is server finally came up after five minutes. Said it wasn't even her station but she was going to help us I was the only help we got from her all day. We ordered two beers 1pint 1mason jar and two waters. It took 10 minutes to get our beers and they were served in plastic cups, I know Tobeys into red solo cups but seriously a Sunday afternoon and they don't have any glasses? The waitress apologized and told us she would repour into glass & told us the bartenders had a busy night last night so there weren't many glasses available , what a joke!!! After 20 more minutes we still have not received our waters nor appetizers and we had no idea where our server was so we threw a 20 down &got up and left.... I will not go back and would urge you not to go at all"
1,"Great groomers, all very lovely and helpful people. Easy to get appointments, easy-to-find location (I get lost a lot). I bring both my dogs here and one is kind of a spazz. Both are always calm and look like handsome, respectable gentlemen when they are done."
0,Update: Got some food to go for my wife and myself on Sunday. And it was horrible! My wife got a french dip and it was just fat and the rest of the meat was tough and disgusting. Very unhappy with my experience. So i will not eat there again.
1,"Living up to the hype, there are many things that I loved about Lux, and other things that I would warn newbies when coming here:\n\nPROS:\n* Their coffee and baked goods are pretty tasty. I got a chilled mocha and it was the right kind of chocolaty and the right kind of caffeinated-buzz. I also got a croissant (because I saw one next to me and immediately decided that I wanted it) and it was fluffy and delicious.\n\n* The coffee shop is huge, so it allows you to find a chair, nook, couch SOMEWHERE or if you come with friends you can all hang around together in some corner. The store has different spaces so keep looping around if you don't see any free spots at first. \n\n* The music selection is quite cool and makes the ambiance pretty happy and chill. The decor is funky so there is a large combination of chairs, tables, sofas for every taste.\n\n* It turns into a bar, well, its always a bar but you can go for both coffee-drinking time or boozy time. I have not had their drinks, but they have a cool bar setup and a large selection of fresh ingredients for (hopefully) a successful execution.\n\n\nCON:\n* Its effing pricey. For reals, its not a \""round the corner\"" coffee shop so assume that your coffee price includes everything from \""ambiance\"" to \""the price of being seen\"" to everything in between.\n\n* The music. Its loud. If you are here to study, well, don't. I came here to read (not knowing any better) and I struggled with a mixture of how loud the music was (even tho i liked the selection!) and the even louder dumbass sorority girls next to me chatting their lives away. This place is social, not a shelter for your quiet-needs. Let me repeat that:\n\nTHIS PLACE IS LOUD. DO NOT COME HERE FOR PEACE AND QUIET.\n\n* Parking. The lot is always (always full), so expect to park on the street wherever you can find. This can sometimes be a challenge, but they have 2hr parking on the street and some back lot, which I am not sure if we are allowed to use.\n\n\nSo there it is folks, the good, the bad and the not-so-ugly. I am ashamed and happy for giving into the hype and trying this place out. I'm not a hipster, a coffee-snob or anything, but I do love anywhere with great quality food and drinks where I feel welcome. Isn't that what its all about anyway?"
1,"Still one of if not my favorite Burger \n\nand I have to get one every time I am in  a state with InNOut as we don't have them in Seattle\n\nso from down town take the bus up the strip too Dean Martin Way then cross the street & catch the 201 west bound and it will let you off just across the street from this InNOut\n\nHad me a Double Double Animal Style and some fries, oh yeah the Tummy was sedated for a few hours, wish I had Animal Styled the fries also, oh well next time baby \n\nright next door just across the lot at this location they have a gift shop with Hats, Shirts, Back Packs, Travel Mugs, and Jackets plus a few other little gifts to show your InNOut Pride"
0,If you like pubic hair in your Sauce go ahead And eat here. All these reviews are not accurate these tacos are not the best. The place looked really dirty and the cashier lady was rude when helping costumers! BAD SERVICE. If I could give 0 stars I would
0,"The food sucked!  The Calimari was disgusting and my canniloni tasted like it came out of a frozen box.  My water was good. Servers, you're supposed to serve, so prepare the table for the food to be brought out so we don't have an uncomfortable guessing game while you hold a hot plate over my head."
0,"This show sucks!! It's really boring and some of the people around me even fell asleep. I don't see what the hype is all about. I wanted to see a Cirque du Soleil show, not some play. They tried to do this story thing and I STILL didn't get it. The whole time I was wondering when they were going to actually do something out of the ordinary. That moment never really came. There was this thingy (don't wanna ruin for the people who do want to see it) that was kinda cool but not breath taking. There was absolutely no wow factor in this show. Okay there's this one part that I'm gonna tell you about. Warning! DO NOT read if you are planning on going. This chick was doing this stick twirling like she was a colorguard. That was cool but I didn't think it was appropriate for this type of show. I wish I spent a little extra to watch O. This was seriously a waste of my time and money."
0,"Disappointing!  I have stayed here many times however the last several months the service has really slipped.  They are not very friendly at the front desk, and don't do anything to recognize Hilton Honors status other than a couple of bottles of water, don't expect an upgrade even when the place is empty, you would think they would want to take care of their loyal members when the rooms are sitting empty.  Today the rep forgot to give me a parking pass so when I went back up the two employees at the owners check in area stood and talked to each other while I stood there waiting and watching, finally they asked what I needed.  Once I told them what happened, no apology, just a comment that it is $8 a day for self parking.  On the positive side, they have a Great gym but at this point I don't think it out-weighs the lack of respect at check in."
1,"The 5 stars is based on their sashimi. The fish practically melts in your mouth. It's so fresh with none of the icky oily feel from most of the other places I've been to. The best thing is their fresh wasabi, which tastes so much better than the usual green glob served. The downside is of course that sashimi is quite expensive.\n\nTheir sushi rolls, while creative and decently sized, weren't all that unique. Keep in mind practically all sushi rolls taste similar to me so I won't let that affect my rating."
0,"Ok so I get the peanut thing, wood accented atmosphere, good service (although rather \""in your face\"" at times) and the packed dining room / bar even on a Thursday night. \n\nWhat I don't get is the awful food. This was my FIRST (and last) visit into this franchise restaurant. How they convinced franchisees and the general public to invest and vote with hard earned dollars is beyond me.\n\nI took my friends 11 year old there after he played in a b'ball game and after looking at the menu and pricing decided to split the rib eye special $19.99. \n\nI got the fried pickle appetizer as well and was sorely disappointed in the batter and both of the \""dipping sauces\"" (watery ranch and thousand island? I really couldn't tell).  Even a franchise like H***ers makes them WAY better......wow.\n\nOn to the main course. The baked potato with butter and cream cheese was overcooked or something? I have never had a potato that seemed to have been soaked in some type of brine and then baked? Kind of par boiled or something. Anyway the color was greyish and the taste like that of a fishy sea salt.\n\nMoving to the broccoli i was greeted by a palor yellow looking presentation. I couldn't tell if it was cheesy cauliflower or ? Wow the taste was again that of something really overcooked or under matured...YICK\n\nThe last chance at redemption came with the medium well rib eye. Good sized portion and easily split between the two of us 20oz. Good wholesome beefy taste and great texture only to be squallored  by a heavy Saltiness....not sure where this was picked up from but maybe by hanging out too close to the potato? \n\nI really am normally an amicable restaurant patron but after forking over $46 including tip for two to split some food and getting served what we did ...well you get my drift.\n\nSigned, \n\nNeverToStepFoot-InsideTheRoadhouseAgain"
1,"YUM. I eat here at least once a week because  cant get enough of the Humanitarian which is grilled veggies, hummus, and chicken.  They  usually have a neat craft beer to offer. . We usually have Brittany as our server and she rocks the house They have switched to an all burrito menu and the concepts are pretty unique.. I like the fact that you can for go the tortilla and just eat the filling. Their green chili mac and cheese is to DIE FOR. The chef  even comes  table side to ensure you've enjoyed your meal. They did make some changes but life is about change and the food is good enough to adapt."
1,"Schwartz's smoked meat is pretty amazing. Tender, juicy, and very delicious. Like most people, you don't go here for the ambiance or anything else except for their smoked meat. \n\nThe wait was only 15-20 min so that wasn't too bad, however, standing in line all you can smell is trash and funk, not the best pre-game environment.\n\nThe service was fast, friendly, and good. You might be squished with other people if you're a small party because of the lack of seating available. \n\nOverall, it was worth it"
0,"If you like dated restaurants, with carpet that hasn't been clean in a decade, with an air quality that is stuffy and smelly, with long waits because they don't have enough waiters on the floor, and recipes that use the same 4 ingredients in all their dishes (one of them being LOTS of salt), then Riazzi's is the restaurant for you."
1,"As my friends and I were walking down the strip, we're noticing a lot of people carrying around these bong-looking things with a variety of colors of the rainbow. I was like, \""The hell? I want one too dammit!\"" Then we ran into Caesers Palace and found the bar that sells em. As we approached the bar, they offered free samples. I swear, when I heard \""free samples\"" with alcohol, I jizzed in my pants.\n\nMy favorite one was the \""Up All Night\"" with an extra shot. As I finished mine, the bartender told me that I can get a refill with a 3 dollar discount.\n\nO_O\n\n*jizzed in my pants*"
0,We bought a huge tree for the second year in a row. Last year it was fine. This year it has died prior to Christmas. We are having a big party on Christmas and my tree looks horrible and we are very upset. I called twice but only got an answering machine. We watered appropriately to no avail. It is dropping pines and dead. What a bummer.
0,"I was so exited to try this place out! I thought finally something new downtown! After three visits, this place gets boring. Yes they do have some few good entr\u00e9e to offer, but are they memorable? I would say no. What memorable to me is the wait I get all the time for meeting a friend for brunch. Their policy is they wont seat you until the whole party is present. Yes maybe a friend or two is running late, but to see the place empty full of open chairs, and still they won't seat you, now that's different service.\n\nThere's also this discomfort of eating when the owner just seats there and watch her servers do their job. She'll correct them discreetly but not so privately. I've seen owners help out by greeting you or seating you, but this one is different. She just seats in her throne. I am more about interaction with your customers, but never in the three visits have I seen her interact with customers. \n\nLike I said, food is good, but not memorable."
0,"Here. Have a star for every shrimp you put in my stale papaya salad, bastards."
0,"Horrible Service.  I have not been to a kona grill in some time due to gluten free restrictions I have to take into account starting a few years ago.  We were shopping in the area and seen they now have a dedicated Gluten Free menu.  When we arrived we asked the hostess if we could view the menu first just to see what options we had.  She was fairly rude, gave us one menu (for 3 people to look at) and walked away.  We decided to stay and eat and then got a server who obviously had no idea about gluten free.  We became an inconvenience for him.  He didn't know any details, didn't offer to ask, and then offered to do a side of fried rice (we've had this gluten free at other places).  About 35 min later I believe the manager, who by the way saved this from being a 1 star review came to our table.  Very nice and asked about our gluten free request.  We let him know we have to eat gluten free.  He then stated that the fried rice Is not gluten free and offered to give us something else.  What I failed to mention before is that when we ordered we asked if we could do a side of fruit with our  turkey burgers.  We were told \""No\"" we don't have that as an option.  Back to the manager, he said we can do vegetables or fruit for you.  Awesome we will take the fruit we said.  We wanted to order that originally but were told you don't have that.  The manager said they do and will take care of that for the future guests to know.  The meal ended up being good, we got what we wanted, but the service was horrible and two out of the three employees treated us like we were weird people due to our food requirements."
0,"....was not impressed... I know their menu is seasonal... but... it's just not that great. The Monkey bread was the best thing they had on the menu... and the first time I've ever seen Monkey bread on a menu, that's the only perk. It's a beautiful little place right next to the pool... and it's very small, just a heads up. The customer service wasn't  that great, it took forever to get our food and it wasn't even busy. My friend and myself sent our food back. She had the chicken and waffles and said it was horrible. I had a noodle soup thing... I went to fork my noodles out and a big clump of coagulated noodles came up on my fork... ICK! I sent it back and got the pulled pork sandwich. thankfully that was ok... just ok. I've had better... I wouldn't waste my time here, there's sooo many other great places to eat, but if you're craving some warm, honey, nutty Monkey bread... make the time to get some!"
1,"I love reading about my yelp friends' vacation finds.  I always bookmark them because although I never know when I'll be in that part of the country, I do know those bookmarks will eventually become tourist destinations for me.  My yelp bud Tim S. knows his comfort foods.  When he raves about a pizza in New York, a cheesesteak in Philly, or a hot dog in Phoenix, I'm so there.  Wait a Hot Dog in Phoenix?  That can't be right.  This ain't Chicago or New York.  Or is it?  Ted's is a Buffalo, NY Hot Dog blooming right here in the middle of the desert, transplanted in 1983 from it's 1927 original wintery environment.  \n\nSometimes when you are a food tourist, it's ok to over order and try a few different things.  It's not ok for your waistline, but \""Hey you're on vacation!\""  At least that's what I tell myself.  And I got absolutely no judgement from Ted's when I ordered a Regular Hot Dog, a Jumbo All Beef dog, an Italian Sausage, and a Bratwurst.  Chased down with some Onion Rings and a Loganberry Milkshake.\n\nSo what makes Ted's so good, is the charcoal.  As I came in, they were adding a bunch of new charcoal to the grill.  It gives the dog a nice smokey flavor and a good snap.  Each of my 4 dogs/ sausages were excellent and it's tough to choose which one was best.  I actually think I preferred the basic hot dog, because of the soft grind of the wiener offset with the crunchy slightly charred casing.  It was texture heaven for sure, and I got this one dressed in classic Chicago style - chopped onions, relish, tomato, pickle, and yellow mustard.  I dressed the all beef with kraut and chopped onions - excellent dog although a little firmer in texture, as most beef dogs are.  \n\nThey have polish, bratwurst, italian, and a white hot under their sausage menu.  I read a couple of slightly negative reviews on the white hot, so while it sounded very interesting, I had no room to put one down on this visit.  Italian and Bratwurst it was for me and I got them dressed the same way with grilled onions and peppers.  I opted for the hot sauce on the side.  The hot sauce pairs perfectly with the Italian Sausage.  This is a nice and spicy Italian.  Adding the hot sauce seemed to just reinforce that same flavor, rather than cover it up.  Ted's has an interesting home made hot sauce.  If you made a salsa out of hot dog condiments, this is what you would get - relish, onions, in a ketchup vinegar base.  For the bratwurst I went straight up with some brown deli mustard.  Awesome!   Next visit, I'm trying a chili cheese dog for sure.\n\nThe onion rings taste like an onion loaf, but not super peppery.  They have a great batter here, but I like that you can still taste the onion and there isn't too much batter.  The Loganberry shake is a must order.  The perfect sweet creamy drink to offset the spicy Italian Sausage.  From what I understand loganberry is a Western NY flavor, because you don't see it around these here parts too much.  It's like a red blackberry.  I have no idea if it was loganberry flavored ice cream or vanilla ice cream with loganberry syrup.  Whatever it is, order it and you will be happy.  I can't wait until the next time I'm in Phoenix (or Buffalo) to get me a charcoal grilled dog at Ted's. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/teds-hot-dogs-tempe?select=HYh6Dv4htWxebTjRMwgh6g#OCLoB-p-pzUUNcCib8xK-Q"
0,"This place is horrible. The front desk staff is so rude. After the doctor saw my son, I went to the front desk to make an appointment. They call someone else up when I'm trying to talk to them, so I wait. As I am waiting, another family gets next to me. I asume they're going to wait until after me. No, they go ahead and tell the guy they need an appointment and I tell him I need an appointment too. The man in the front desk completely disregarded the fact that I was there first and helped them before me. The only reason I didn't say anything is because I knew I would have a attitude and I was too classy to  make a scene. \nOh, how I regretted it. Such an incompetent staff.\n\nAside from that I made an appointment for 10 o clock and didn't get seen until 11:30. What's the point of making appointments if you're not going to honor them?\n\nThe only reason there is a star on here is for the great doctor."
1,"5 stars because it's 100% non-smoking!!!! MOST EXCELLENT!\n\nI hate Las Vegas, but love coming to golf.  Finding a place to stay where I can breathe is difficult...this little joint filled the bill.\n\nOk, it's odd that it's dog friendly, but I'd rather smell dog than smoke any day.\n\nRates are good, the rooms are spotless (we had one with the big jacuzzi tub - well worth the few extra dollars.)\n\nYes, the cable sucks - and even if we are in Vegas some of us do want excellent cable coverage, and this didn't have it....never could find NBC.\n\nThe cable is tough for sure; we found later at night and first thing it was fine...the place was 100% sold out and I can see why.\n\nHave fun!"
0,We ate Breakfast here a few days ago since we are staying at Mandalay Bay.  Note to future hotels guests:  Skip this and go to Raffles or Citizens instead.\n\nWe are pretty sure that most of what they serve for breakfast is pre made and sitting in chafing dishes in the back.  Everything came out within 90 seconds...none of it was hot...and it was definitely not cooked to order.  I won't waste time a long review with detailed food items - and maybe their lunch or dinner is better - but 50 bucks for premade breakfast - no way!  \n\nOne Star - YUK!!!
1,"I love this spa.  The spa is large, spacious and luxurious (in every aspect).  The peaceful environment helps you unwind and relax.  I have had three treatments here and each experience was very relaxing.  The sauna, steam room and (hot, warm and cold) whirlpools are awesome.  The staff is helpful and friendly, not pretentious at all.  The price is steep for their services (minus one star), but it is worth the splurge."
1,"By far THE BEST Walgreens I have ever gone to.  I've had the luxury of flying into Vegas the last two trips that I've taken.  This is great because I'm not spending hours in the car but it also sucks because I cannot bring more than 3 oz. of liquids on my flight unless I want to check my bags (that's a negative).\n\nCut to buying booze at this Walgreens.  It is a convenient walk from the Cosmopolitan where I stayed on the first trip.  We just took that bridge from the Cosmo to Walgreens for alcohol, Powerade, chasers, Pepto Bismol, candy, snacks, popcorn.  You name it, we bought it at this Walgreens.\n\nCut to the second trip in Vegas: we stayed at the Marriott Grand Chateau - also walking distance.  We pretty much did the same alcohol run.  However, on this trip, I did a haphazard job at packing and forgot my eyeliner.  No problemo.  This Walgreens has the BEST cosmetics section ever.  My friends hovered around the fragrance section and even ended purchasing the one named \""Between the Sheets\"" (made for an interesting talking point with cab drivers).  I picked up a great liquid eyeliner which has now replaced the Sephora one I was using before.\n\nThe line to check out looks really intimidating but here's a secret - you can check out that the register in the cosmetics area!  \n\nFrom here on out, I will be planning Vegas trips and where we stay in Vegas based on its proximity to this Walgreens.  Legit."
1,"Bonnie L, your Jacuzzi reference was from Aladdin....I'm a Disney nerd, what can I say? I just got back from Vegas myself, and I stayed at the Mandalay Bay as well. That was you and your friends keeping me and my boyfriend awake that night? Haha, just kidding. \n\nBut really I have to agree that the soundproofing was terrible. I don't mind the airport noise, because I live near one and actually find it relaxing, (I know I'm weird.) but the noise in the hallway was pretty bad at some points. \n\nRoom: Beaauutiful and really modern. We had two Lounge Chaises right by the window, which is floor to ceiling, btw. The window offered a great view of the strip and part of the airport at night. The flatscreen tv was amazing. The bed was soooo comfortable, I think it had two layers of down comforters, and I felt like I was sleeping in a cloud. Ipod docking station was prime. It was nice to be able to listen to my favorite songs while getting ready to go out. \n\nThe bathtub was enormous, and I got to watch movies while I relaxed. After the bath you can jump into the gorgeous shower, which is made of little non-slip stones, (there's no better way I can think to describe it, sorry!) and has a great shower head.  I did not want to leave. There was also a separate toilet room, and two sinks, how nice! I wish I could have stayed here my whole trip. \n\nThe Pool:\nYou can't get in without a room key which gets scanned, and they know if you are really staying there or not so be careful! The only way I know this is because we wanted to take a dip after checking out and they asked us if we had just checked out. High tech fun spoilers! They let us in anyhow though. It was a little chilly, so I didn't enjoy it as much as I should have, but the wave pool is beautiful, it sounds like the real pacific ocean that I miss so much! There is even real sand beneath the lounge chairs. There is also a lazy river, but it was cold so I didn't go in.\n\nThe Casino:\nSmells nice. I don't gamble so what can I say.\n\nThe Shark Reef:\nFreaking awesome. Do it, its worth the money, but don't rush through it. Think of it as your little nature escape from Vegas for an hour or two.\n\nThe nightclubs:\nI went to Rumjungle on a on a Sunday, it was down time for them. Cool bar though. After that I went to Ivan Kane's Forty Deuce. It was fun, tbat that is another yelp story to be told.\n\nSo why only four stars after such a glowing review? The check-out process was a NIGHTMARE. The lines are not formed at all, so people are just clustered together, and some of them apparently cant read. Check-In window is for when you want to get a room. Check-Out window is for when you want to leave and don't want to stand in line for  forty-five minutes behind all the bozos trying to check-in at the CHECK-OUT LINE!!!!! Really there is a reason for designated lines, and it is because checking in takes twice as long as checking out. True story! How irritating, they really should either rope off lines so that people can't stand to the left of the line and then cut you off, claiming they were in line, or not let people check-in at the check-out line. That is my only large and volatile complaint."
0,"We are locals and dine at Ferraro's a lot, but we won't be back. The food was good but not the service. We went there with a restaurant.com cert which irritated the server, and the time before we went for their locals promotion only to be treated the same way. When our bill was presented she took the cert and when it was returned to us their was a 3.00 difference same with the locals promotion. She also had charged us for the most expensive glass of wine when we had the less expensive wine. We purchased two glasses at the bar at one price and were charged more at the table for the second glasses. This is the third time we have been treated this way by the same server. If they are going to offer specials they should honor them. We have dined and spent a lot there without discounts there was no reason to do this. We will not be back. Also the 18% gratuity that she added on the second bill was not necessary my daughter works in the industry so we always tip 20 to 25% so she lost out, wrong person to do this to. Never again"
1,"Trying new restaurants is a hobby of mine, if you couldn't tell. While doing research for this Vegas trip, I came across Andre's in the Monte Carlo. It's Michelin rated, the menu looked great and the location was perfect. After a few long days in Vegas, staying in the hotel on our last night was a great option. \n\nWhen you cross the casino floor to get to Andre's, you wonder if the noise from the party pit will be bothersome, that is, until the hostess opens the doors to the dining room. This was a really impressive room, it's dark and sexy in browns and blues with touches of purples and grays. High banquettes line one wall with tables around the room. We were seated in a banquette and conversations around us were so muted that if we didn't see the staff attending to other tables, we would have thought we were alone.  The room left us with quite the first impression. The music was great too, I think I knew every song, but I've been told I'm somewhat of a music savant.\n \nRoss, our waiter told us that Chef Andre also owns Alize at the top of the Palms. He used to own a free standing restaurant, also called Andre's, downtown for almost 30 years, but that recently closed. The extensive, mostly French wine list and cocktail menu are presented on an ipad. I went with a Willy Nilly, how can a drink with that name be bad? It was delicious. Gramercy Guy had the Bloody O Cosmo, mine was better.  After determining that we'd both go fish, the sommelier helped us pick out a nice bottle of white.\n\nDinner started with an amuse bouche of frois gras in the shape of a club. For me, it was the perfect creaminess and gaminess that I like. Best part was it did get me excited for the meal to come, my bouche was amused.\n\nThe service was exceptional and the food was superb, our only problem was we had a late lunch and then our new friends from Seattle and Puxatony, PA brought us In-N-Out Burger which is my fast food kryptonite so we couldn't eat most of our dinner. Ross even asked politely if everything was ok with our meal and we told him about the late lunch. I'm not sure he believed us.\n\nEnough people know about Andre's, so it can't be classified as a hidden gem, but I will tell you that I think it's a MUST. \n\nFor pictures and more reviews www.gramercygirl.com"

1,Friday all you can eat seafood at their buffet with unlimited drinks--.. don't miss out
1,"Once I heard about the Walk In Salon online I was super excited to go on my recent trip to Vegas. The prices can't be beat! So while my husband and his buddies spent 2 hours at The Gun Store I spent 2.5 hours at Robert Cromeans. \n\nI had one of the best salon experiences of all time here! Who says you can't get your hair done far away from home base? Truth is, I've always been a salon nomad so I'm not as picky about bouncing between salons/stylists. \n\nI was scheduled with Lauren Jeralds and she was fantastic from start to finish. We had a pretty lengthy consultation first and she really listened to what I wanted. I never felt pressured or dumb, like some stylists make you feel right off the bat. Lauren was very knowledgeable and very patient. She also taught me some tips for when I do my hair at home - how to blow dry, curl, and even trim my bangs (though she told me not to do that but said she knew I would anyway, LOL). \n\nI ended up getting a cut, partial highlight, and shine treatment. The whole shebang cost about $130. Such a great deal! I would recommend coming here to anyone unless you are very particular about where you get your hair done. Still, the Paul Mitchell line of products is excellent, and the care and 'do you'll receive here is worth every penny."
0,Yuck. The food was terrible. The crowd was awful. I would never go back here. The end.
0,"Not a super fan. Not a super hater. Definitely not the best area. It looks old and you often have random stragglers hanging out.\n\nWhat I do like about this location is that they sometimes have the cheapest gas for the east side of town. Their marquee sign clearly states that prices are for cash/debit. However, if you swipe your debit card in the gas station it will not give you that price. You have to go inside and have the cashier ring you as a debit in order for those prices to be applicable.\n\nA pain in my butt it can be, especially when I don't want to go inside or deal with people but I guess if I want the cheaper gas - it is a price I have to pay."
0,"I came here hoping to have a great time with my cousins and friends, but the whole race was a disaster .  I've been to a few other Rock N Rolls ( i.e. San Antonio, Dallas ) , but this one was pretty poorly organized .\n\nWhere should I begin ?\n\n1) The baggage check was way inside the Mandalay Bay , while the start/finish line was on the Strip .  It seemed like we walked about 1/2 mile to and from the baggage check .\n2) The half and full marathons merged eventually for about at least a 1/3 of the run .  That caused a lot of chaos for the full marathoners .\n3) They ran out of medals !  Luckily I got mine, but one of my cousins and her BF didn't get hers .\n4) The finish line was horrendous .  Normally people run/jog through the finish line, but I noticed a lot of people just stopping/waiting just to cross the finish line .  There was a pretty big bottle-neck .\n5) Once you finish the race and get your bags , it took another hour to get out of the hotel .\n\nThere were 44K+ runners , so it was pretty crowded .  Was told that the organizers were actually aiming for 60K+ runners !  That would be ridiculous !\n\nI do appreciate the volunteers/officers that were out there cheering us on and handing out the water/sports drinks .\n\nNeedless to say though, I won't be running this one again ."
0,"Let me start by saying the food was good, once I got it.\n\nI came here for a business lunch with the rest of my coworkers from my office. I ordered The Outlaw Burger, and I ordered 2nd out of our line of 7 people.\n\nWe all went to sit outside and wait for our food. Fast forward a bit to after everyone else has their food, I decide to go in and see what's up with my order.\n\nThe lady checks my ticket and goes to see where it is. She comes back and tells me \""it'll be right out\"". I wait another 10 minutes and see many other orders come out, but not my order. I ask again and she checks again, then tells me \""just a couple more minutes\"". 10 minutes later I ask her \""am I going to get a burger today?\"", so she checks again. 5-10 minutes after that she comes out and says \""they have it on now\"".\n\nA full hour after I ordered, after all my coworkers have finished their lunch, and after every other table in the place received their order, they finally bring my burger out. I had to take it to go, since I spent my whole lunch break waiting for it.\n\nThe guy who brought it out was nice and threw in some fries, but I was upset at that point. I paid $13 for a burger, even left a good tip when I signed the receipt thinking I'll be the nice guy who tips at these places, and the lady who caused all of this didn't even attempt to apologize.\n\nNeedless to say, even though the food was decent, they just lost business from 7 locals, out of which I was overly excited to try the food here.\n\nWe most likely will never be back.\n\nThanks for the fries, mr. server."
0,"Thought I should update my last experience concerning the volunteering situation at Ballet AZ.  I waited a couple of years and went back and offered my services.  Must have been my instincts because i delayed sending them the paperwork.  Just as well because I was told soon after they \""rescinding\"" their offer to have me do volunteer work with them???  This happened awhile back now, but last I heard the same people are handling that area so doubt if things have changed any.  \n\nYou be the judge"
1,"Good fricken' grief, best frozen yogurt place ever. Chicago, you better watch yourself because Cocomero knows how to make frozen yogurt nonfat and tasty. I don't care for the probiotic stuff.\n\nUnlike your other frozen yogurt places that only offer 4 or so flavors, Cocomero gives you at least 14 flavors to choose from. And no, you don't have to deal with places that don't know how to swirl your yogurt properly so there's a big gaping hole in the middle (where your money went), you serve yourself and you pay 50 cents per ounce. You also self-serve toppings like mango, cookie dough, mochi and cheesecake bites.\n\nToday I loaded up on following flavors: red velvet, cookies and cream, and strawberry. I then added my favorite mix-ins: mango and cookie dough. I paid $5.40 for 20 minutes of okay, maybe I got too much, but damn this is good.\n\nThey also offer bubble tea, milk tea lattes, and shaved ice with fruit. I'm assuming this is an Asian venture. I also like sticking around for the two-story ambiance if you can deal with Britney Spears' latest album playing in the background."
1,"We stayed here because it was quite a bit cheaper than the Holiday Inn and the pet deposit with much cheaper (20$ compared to 100$ at holiday inn). We brought our English bulldog, who weighs about 55 lbs. I called and even though they say their limit is 35 lbs, they worked with us on that which was amazing!! There was not even a breed restriction which is hard to find, especially with Bulldogs. \n\nThe woman at the hotel was unbelievably accommodating. I believe her name was Jamie, she was so so so amazing. She told us up front what the policies were, how much it was and all the good stuff. My fianc\u00e9 plays for the AFL team in Surprise, so instead of going to the team hotel, we opted to pay for this one and I'm more than happy we did. I recommend this to all baseball families, families with pets, families on budgets, and anyone in general. This is a great place to stay and if we happen to be out this way again, we will absolutely choose this hotel. Thank you for making our experience so great and having such amazing staff!!!!!!"
0,"degree270 could be a really cool spot, but it's a miss in a lot of ways....\n\nPros - Amazing views, terraces, open layout, part of the casino\n\nCons - No cocktail servers, interior is cheaply done, no furniture on the terraces, won't allow you to open the doors because the air conditioning can't compensate, serve cocktails in plastic cups, decent appetizers but not worth the prices."
0,"What the heck happened to this place? It looks dirty, with people that look like they might actually be homeless sitting at the slots, and the casino itself is practically empty. \n\nThe buffet isn't anything to brag about either. Even for a \""locals casino\"", this place sucks. Probably because it's in a terrible area. \n\nYuck!"
0,"I ate here with my husband as a convenient stop before we went shopping.  It's cafeteria food, people.  I didn't go in there thinking I was going to get a five star meal for $3.99.  I got the veggie pasta w/ alfredo sauce and my husband got the spaghetti and meatballs.  I couldn't even make it through half of the store before I felt super duper sick.  No more cafeteria food for this girlie.  Stick with the hot dogs and ice cream that you can get after check out...."
1,"I love walmart prices BUT I hate shopping there. There's also a Lowe's in the area with a lawn and garden center which is nice but I wanted more variety in plants. Not only does Star Nursey have a huge selection you can even purchase a plant at different stages of growth. What does that mean for those of us that are not familiar with gardening? I found a palm plant with pinnate leaves, which I've been wanting but I know they can be really expensive. They were available at a young age (the least expensive) to almost full grown (most expensive). Of course I picked the least expensive and was able to load 2 palm plants, a red tail ornamental grass (wish I would have got 2 of them), 2 orleander, and 2 desert daisies into a compact car. Oh and a shovel and a rack/hoe combo thing. They have EVERYTHING you need for your lawn/sprinkler system/stones etc."
0,"We visted this place several years ago and throughly enjoyed it. I would have rated it 3.5-4 stars back then.  Oh how the mighty have fallen. On our recent trip we had dinner here and it was bad!  Alot of the food was old and cold. The king crab legs tasted like salt licks and a large number of other dishes were too scary looking to try. The prime rib and desert section was Aria's only saving grace. The gelato was housed in a revolving freezer that sort of reminded my of a Ice Cream Pistol LOL.  Avoid eating here as this is no longer a good buffet.  There is an all you can drink option for beer and wine for $12.99.  I suppose if you drink enough the food might taste better LMAO\n\nThe lobster shown in photos is availble on Fridays and I think Saturday, the price is considerably higher and you are limited to 1/2 lobster tail per person."
1,"This place is great. Saves me the headache of having to go to seafood city for some quick essentials. The store is always clean and organized and has a friendly atmosphere. The two cashiers I've seen have always been very polite to everyone I've seen walk in.  I briefly talked to the owner the week of their opening and he's a real friendly guy.  Their selection is a bit limited for now, but I'm sure it's bound to expand."
0,"McFadden's Restaurant and Saloon? It should be ashamed to call itself a restaurant, and even they'd tell you it isn't a saloon. You'd expect a place like McFadden's to be Irish. There's nothing Irish about a very dark place playing overly loud ghetto music. We sat ourselves on the patio to get away from the loudness. We counted 4 security guards, 3 waitresses, and 2 bartenders. 9 Employees and it took 10 minutes to get someone to ask us if we wanted a drink. Then it took another 10 minutes to get the drink and I think there were only about 6 other customers. Most of the employees stand around and play with their phones. \n\nThere are much better places to go in Westgate. We went to McFadden's our first night in Glendale and it became the punchline for the rest of our trip."
1,"I have used SMW for many years for routine maintenance on my a/c and heater.  I knew the unit was old, but for years they have been repairing it as needed, until finally they gave me the opinion that it needed to be replaced.  I had to wait a couple days for the scheduled replacement, and during that time the a/c died completely.  Scott came out to my house in the evening, just to see if there was anything he could do to get an extra day or two, but no luck.  They moved up my installation time, and there was no charge for the extra service visit.  I love my new unit and would never consider using any other company for my a/c needs."
0,"Pro: quick service, lots of veggies in the Lean & Green omelette.\nCons: said veggies cooked in so much oil I had to use the toast I subbed for the potatoes to blot each bite. Server never checked on me so just gave feedback at the end of the meal. Someone ordering something called \""lean\"" & subbing dry toast for potatoes is not looking for an oily mess. Coffee not hot & not great, either. Too bad, cute place & nice location next to hotel, but will be looking for something else for the next 2 mornings of my stay in Phoenix."
1,"Okay take this review with a grain of salt because I was really hungover and couldnt eat very much I still managed a huge plate of breakfast food and a small plate of lunch food. We got their at 11 so go to enjoy both. My girlfriend was less hungover and absolutely loved it. \n\nThe scrambled eggs were terrible and the only thing I didnt like, I shoulda waited in the omlette line cuz of course that woulda been fresh and delicious. Everything else was good. The little tater tot breakfast things were so good, same witht the bacon, and seafood at lunch.\n\nWe used two 5/off coupons and they accepted both of them making our total less than 25 bucks for the two of us. It was a great value. Wish I could have ate more."
1,"Forget the rest, they're busy for a reason, I just gotta learn to speak Spanish (they speak English, but it might seem more authentic if I can order in Spanish)."
0,"Tried to pick up a quick meal on the way from the Railway and have a picnic at the park.  Sadly the honey walnut shrimp was soggy and the shrimp meat was tough and chewy especially at the tail ends.  They served us the brown fried rice (yeck!) instead of white fried rice.  Ate half of it hoping it was just a few bad pieces, nope it just got worse.  Next day I had the bad food stomach botulism hangover.  My girls orange chicken looked like it fresh enough.  Never realized how to appreciate the Las Vegas fast food until I ordered shrimp in a small town where they probably don't like seafood in general or they just can't fathom spending another buck on it.  Still love you Boulder City but fcuk this Panda yo."
1,"Fluff- A little disappointed about how they didn't serve ice cream on top like the picture shown on yelp but it was still good! I just wished they put mochi in the fluff instead of that weird Italian custard thing.. it was sour and just did not go along with the green tea or red bean at all. \n \nDrinks- I asked for a jasmine green milk tea and although it was a tad bit sweet, I liked it that way. Being from L.A, it is hard to find good milk teas out in Vegas. \n\nOther than that, super friendly employees & fast service!"
0,"My friends and I shared a room together during Evo 2012 and we stayed at the Roman Towers floor 14. The room was pretty nice, BUT on the day we checked out our friend was removing luggage from the top of the TV Cabinet (pretty tall at least 6 ft) and a DUSTY, OLD, USED CONDOM FELL TO THE GROUND. Idk about you guys, but I was pretty pissed that our room ended up not being cleaned from top to bottom especially with it being Caeser's Palace. \n\nMy boyfriend called the front desk and explained the situation and they said they'd send up a manager. We got a call about 10min later from front desk saying they'd comp a phone call that was made for $62 (boyfriend had called me \""long distance\"" because it was a call from NV to a CA cellphone - was about 5 minutes long). Obviously that wasn't the point and they ended up sending up the manager. So the manager and another random lady showed up, we explained the story and he pretty much confirmed what had happened. To be honest, I don't think anybody believed us because we all LOOK like we're teenagers but I was the youngest in the room and I am 23, so they probably thought we made everything up.\n\nANYWAYS, 10 min passed and we got another phone call from some random person who was obviously given the task to call us and he said they'd comp us $50 for the room. Our other roommate then chimed in explaining how what had happened was a completely violation to cleaning standards, but nothing else happened. On the way down I reminded them that they said they would comp the WHOLE phone call and not just $50, so when we went to the Check-Out desk we explained to the lady our story and she was happy to do it (of course she was, so we wouldn't cause a commotion most likely). We all remained professional during the entire thing and kept telling them it wasn't about the money, it was just disgusting and they acted like it wasn't a big deal.\n\nAnyways, probably never staying here again. Completely grossed out and disappointed with the lack of customer service with this place. Caesar's Palace is going to SH*T."
1,Had a very nice dinner here for 3 couples.  Food and service was excellent.  Asparagus soup de jour was the highlight.
0,"Typical chinese restaurant, medium size of restaurant so many guest but only 2 servers. Only 1 who take orders. The wait for the food is pretty long. When I asked the server, about the food, she didn't bother to respond. Food finally came after 35 min uses of waiting. Food is typical chinese nothing special.\n\nAlright.. i got to ADD to my review. This written 7 hours later. I got sick right after I was out from this restaurant. In fact, my tummy was not feeling great while I was eating my lunch. therfore I didn't finish my food then. Both my son and I got stomach ache. I almost vomit in front of my car and try to stay positive about it (thinking can not be from this restaurant) but after 7 hours, I must said got to be some fish filled or shrimp that I ate, they may not be fresh. Overall, this restaurant is not worth it, bad service and bad food. Too bad I have to take one star out of my review."
0,"Cindy 's review is spot on. They just lack class at this establishment. Our server told us they were closed and the bar tender had to remind him what time they served food until. So the two stars are for the bartender. \n\nThere are just too many sushi places in the area to be treated poorly. \n\nThe food was decent, the price was fine, I am just too old for bad service by a waiter who sniffles and talks rapidly without ever making eye contact. Grow up, clearly you still want to be in college, but you're not."
0,"We stayed here last week as our kids were participating in a Swim Meet next door at the High school. Breakfast was bad, eggs were cold and kinda burned, how can anyone burn an egg!! The double beds in the kids room, were in poor shape, they literally buckle up as you lay down. And here is the worst of all, the Meet was going to be over at noon which is check out time, when we asked the manager to do a late check out for just one hour so the kids can take showers before we head out to the Airport, the manager had a real bad attitude and said he will let us stay an extra hour if we pay for an additional half a day!!! To think of all the money the team spent at that place!!!\nDouble check your bill for accuracy, as they had by \""mistake\"" one night at a higher rate.\nThey get two stars for location to both High School and Downtown."
0,"My wife and I decided to catch a afternoon movie, a rare treat with a two year old, and decided to go to the Ipic theatre. We had previously gone to a cineopolis in del mar, California, which was a fantastic experience. Unfortunately, this was not nearly as good a experience. \nFor starters, the price was steep, even for luxury cinemas standards. This in itself wouldn't have been too bad if you'd get what you pay for. In my opinion we did not get that. The theatre is nice looking, and the bathrooms are modern and very clean. The staff was helpful with one exception, but I'll get to that. The absolute biggest disappointment of the afternoon was the seats. For $25 per seat I'd expect a comfortable seat and a Unobstructed view. I'm 6'1 and the handrail going up the aisles was blocking out the bottom corner of the screen, minor perhaps, but at that price I expect better. The seat itself was old, and either a metal or wood bar in the back of the seat was stabbing me in the lower back. I thought \""maybe it's just this one seat\"", but nope, my wife had the exact same issue. It would have been comfortable enough if not for those bars. As it was though, they quite literally kept me from enjoying the movie. My feet were basically hanging over the woman in front of me, it was slightly embarrassing and uncomfortable. Thankfully we didn't have any feet above us, being in the last row, otherwise I don't think I would have stayed. \nThe food, while expected to be overpriced, was tiny and a la carte. Fries are $9 extra. Ouch. Do I dare look what I paid for that cup of ice (with some soda to fill the spaces)? The service was decent, though I'd have preferred a button to call the guy, vs him just showing up during the movie at times.\n$26 for a plate with a appetizer as a side and a piece of pie the size of my thumb. Ouch again. \nThe movie would have been so much more enjoyable if those seats hadn't made my entire lower body go numb. Am I regressing?\nFinally, the torture in the seats was over and we were leaving. While waiting for my wife, I mentioned the uncomfortable seats to the girl manning the podium where she checks your tickets. She looked at me like I was blank wall. I don't know if my comment just didn't register with her, or if she couldn't believe my audacity to mention something so unthinkable to her. Either way, she just gave me a blank stare and said nothing. I walked away. \nSo there is a nice AMC luxury cinema in town? Guess where I'm going next time.\nSorry, but this was a fail for Ipic theatres."
0,"My experience's here have never been good. \n\nI frequent Vegas quite often and whenever there is a sporting event I usually end up here. Every time I've been here for an event their tv's are always messing up and falling behind regular time. For example you will hear other areas of the bar cheering because they are on real time, while your personal table's TV  has fallen behind. Quite a nightmare for the fan experience. \n\nIt is set up to be a great sports bar, and yet over the past few years still hasn't gotten it's act together. \n\nThe food is overpriced for what you get. I don't mind spending $15-20 on a burger, but it better be good! \n\nDo yourself a favor and skip this spot.  Instead, why not head upstairs to LAVO and enjoy some amazing food and drink in an ambiance that is much more relaxing. \n\nIf you really want to watch sports while in Vegas, I suggest going to any of the casinos sports lounges and calling it a day. This place is only going to frustrate both your taste buds and your wallet."
1,"Met some friends here for a birthday dinner. Place was packed. I was drinking, but the rest of my group enjoyed the cocktails.\n\nThree of us split a mixed grill plate. Had enough for four as opposed to three. We opted for carne asada, carnitas, and chicken. Everything was prepared well and was quite tasty."
0,The food can be good here (not great but good) but the biggest problem for me is the AWFUL service.  Somebody teach these people some customer service.  I swear that the guy who waited on me the last time I was there was high.  The interminable waiting for refills on drinks and the check drove my blood pressure through the roof.\n\nI've determined that the secret to getting good service from anyone here is to be a hot looking college girl...  that seemed to keep the waiter's attention focused on the table next to mine...  Maybe she was one of the more positive posters here.
0,"OK, so I've upgraded this experience to 2 stars, but it still probably only deserves a 1.5, which is better than last time. \n\nThe burger was actually pretty good this time, and the wait wasn't that bad. Again, this is not a great burger by any means and on any given day you could experience a whopper junior that has more flavor.\n\nWhen the girl asked if I wanted fries, I responded \"" Are they still the same thin, soggy, greasy, flavorless, nothing fries or have you changed your recipe to make decent fries? She just smiled and said they were the same, so I said, \""no thanks\"".\n\nIn and Out is obviously a Southwest thing. Anyone who is from the Midwest or East Coast expects restaurants to rise above mediocrity, but mediocrity, unfortunately, is what passes for \""great food\"" in Arizona."
1,"I first tried their food at a catered party and was really impressed. So, when a friend suggested we eat there, I jumped at the chance.  They are located in the Randolph Medical Center at 1928 Randolph Road. \n\nBasically, they operate from a little store-front, rather than a full service sit-down restaurant. But, don't let that dissuade you from going.  You go place your order at the cash register, and they will bring it out of the kitchen for you. There are tables and chairs in the lobby of the building as well as a few spots outdoors where you can sit down and enjoy a delectable meal. (Or, if you live or work close by, take out is a great option). \n\nThey typically offer specials which vary each day.   I am a big fan of  their Etoufee, Creole, and the pasta dishes that I've tried here. They also have a really good southern (i.e., really sweet) sweet tea, and don't forget to pick up a delicious dessert to take home for later!  Their White Chocolate Bread Pudding  is amazing! And you can't go wrong with any of their cakes  (which, depending on the flavor of the day, could be lemon, strawberry, banana,coconut, german chocolate, carrot, red velvet, pineapple, or chocolate carmel).\n\nIf you love the richness of cajun food, check them out - you'll be so glad you did!"
0,"I would rather eat cardboard than the Pad Seu and the complimentary wings did not make the delivery. The white rice was delicious, but then my 4 year old neice can make white rice."
0,"We went back to Outback last night thanks to a $10 \""gift\"" card and had hoped things had changed for the better but had not. I could drop my rating back half a star but my wife actually enjoyed her meal.\n\nThe reasoning behind dropping at least 1/2 a star is that Outback has deemed it necessary to skimp on their portions in order to make the plates more artsy-fartsy or more \""presentable\"", for those of you who drink with your pinky in the air.\n\nBlooming onion was a bit overcooked and the coating was falling off the onions. (Onions were STRONG, Altoids\u00ae are a must this morning!). Caesar salad's dressing was very strong, too. Mixed drinks were on the small side. I could've sworn the glasses were bigger before.\n\nChicken and ribs: I got a very tiny grilled chicken breast that was a bit on the dry side. The side of ribs were 1/3 the size of their normal full slab and they were the best part of the meal. Side of mashed potatoes were too garlicky and portions tiny.\nMy better-half had the sweet potato fries that were just \""okay\"".\n\nOur server, Noah, was great. Fast, efficient, and friendly. I could almost bump up my rating to another star because of him.\n\nYour pal,\nWalter"
0,This car wash is possibly the slowest ever! I was sitting here alone as the only customer. They took 45 minutes to clean my car! There were still water spots on my car and my back doors were not even wiped down inside! They barely vacuumed my carpets and my center console was dusty and dirty! I have two small kids so my car is a mess. Pictures attached of their horrible job. I'm highly disappointed because I paid for the premium wash ($34) and had to go home and finish their piss-poor job! I have had good washes from here but most bad then good.
1,Thought this would be a fun place to take the kids. Our 8 year old refused to try the sushi but loved the chicken teriyaki. The 12 year old got yakitori that was a little dry but still thought it was good. We liked trying new rolls we haven't tried before and the fact that we all got full for $30. Yes there are better sushi places but the sushi was still good here and the conveyer belt entertained the kids.
1,"I like this location of Starbucks. My friend and I go here after our kickboxing class every week and order drinks and sit and chat. It's nice to not feel cramped in a Starbucks. I find that many Starbucks locations could remove a table or two to put their guests more at ease. The staff here is always friendly and prompt. They are renovating this location right now, so I can't wait to see what they've done with the place on Thursday. Keep up the good work!"
1,Had lunch here today! Very good experience. Considering they were super busy for the rush. Got my food in a reasonable amount of time. And it was cooked to perfection!
1,"This year for christmas I did a lot of DIY gifts, I travled down to MadMaxx's from Tempe one day with my Sister and HOLY COW talk about the most amazing collection of items...from old school coke fridge to furniture to unique trinckets, they had everything we were looking for and more.  I had to come onto Yelp and give a review, Spencer (the owner) was so helpful and extremly nice, he makes you feel like your a regular on your first vist!  I cant wait to go back to see what new treasures I can find."
1,"Our family loves Sushi San. It is a very nice  room with table, booth, and sushi bar seating. Nice woodwork typical of a sushi bar. The food portions are very generous and they like to provide freebies that they call \""service\"". Pricing is very reasonable, you pay for the sushi not some guchi atmosphere. The owners Jane and Chef Eric are super friendly. This is just great conventional sushi! They also have a nice menu of cooked items too like chicken teriyaki. I highly recommend it. Our family eats there 2-3 times a week sometimes."
0,"Very unhappy with the management.  When I signed up I was told by him that there is a 49.95 start up fee (fine), and 9.95 a month (even better)  It seemed to good to be true so I especially asked about other charges and was told there were none. Just the 9.95 a month.  Well guess what!  I just found a $5o.45 charge on my bank statement.  I called customer service and was told that it shows on the contract, under the other expense category that I would be charged a $45.00 re-up fee every June.  I was a bit upset with the manager who lied to me, and customer service who could care less when I cancelled my account (with no reimbursement)  \nBottom line, they can not be trusted, read the small print, my fault for not doing that, their fault for the lies."
1,"Not a lot to say other than great southern comfort food. Good fried chicken, great beef ribs. Small servings of ribs, but great flavor. Loved the collard greens and coconut cake. I'd go back. Definately worth trying."
0,"This place is full of germs and got me sick. The restaurant is filthy and the manager needs to scrub the place and get a more sanitary system for serving food. I wash my hands before I eat every time, but think about how many dirty hands touch the pizza server handle. This is disgusting, you grab the handle and then go eat pizza with those hands. I wish I thought about this before they got me sick. Do yourself a favor & use a napkin to hold the handle. Better yet, get Papa Johns instead, it's way better."
1,"I was visiting Vegas this weekend, and stepped into Sunrise this morning before heading home, and just to be clear: this place rocks! Baristas knew their coffee, and we're super friendly, I also loved that they roasted their beans in store. Size of shop was small but still comfortable. I will definitely be returning to this coffee house whenever I find myself in Vegas again. Oh, and my cappuccino was great."
1,"Just go.  Amazing array of fresh and elegant cuisine.  Chef trained at Daniel in NYC.  Also owns Madre-one of the best weekend brunch places in the city.  Arepa soup was amazing.  Everything else elegant, and delicious.  Very reasonable for high cuisine.  I had a great Cremenera from Chile as a wine.  Good wines, and I think it's now a BYO place-even better."
1,"Great atmosphere, I havent ate anything i didnt like yet =P. Definitely go to try the \""thai tea bomb\"" shot, one of the the best shots i've had!!"
0,"I used to like purchasing donuts for an early morning Sunday treat.  Today, when I came in at about 8 am, the shelves were still almost empty and the choices minimal.  I waited and waited for service, watching the personnel working on something else.  Another customer was already waiting, as well.  I asked, \""Can we get some service here?\""  A woman finally came over and I was told that all the donuts were not ready yet.  I asked for Lance and was told he went to the Surprise location.  When I asked who the new manager was, she told me she was the new manager.  The baker was wearing a filthy, dirty apron and needed a haircut (hair uncovered).  I bought a half-dozen donuts.  They were all chocolate with an overabundance of frosting.  I thought bakers were supposed to get up during the wee hours of the morning, have the donuts ready and a cheerful person available to sell them.  This ruined the stereotype, I guess."
1,I got vegan meatball! Yeah !!!
0,"Poor customer service ruined the entire experience. The coffee was about average, the decor was adorable, but the barista's were so rude that we just took our coffee to go instead of enjoying the ambiance. Won't be recommending this place to others."

0,"This is basically a shop for people that don't know anything about bikes.  My sister used this shop because she doesn't have a clue. \n\nBike tune up = $60  (what a joke)  They don't even wipe the dirt off.  They broke her derailleur in the process.  She had to pay an extra $40 for a new one (which wasn't in stock) and while she was being rung up, they tried to charge her $50 for it.  \n\nThe kicker is that the derailleur was not in the same Shimano family as her other hardware so it doesn't actually work too well.  She says her chain comes off all the time.  \n\nOverpriced, understocked, poor workmanship and they're a bunch of cheats."
1,"It was 2 in the afternoon and neither of us had anything to eat yet..  So we were beyond famished...we were becoming irritable.  We decided to quickly scan the Grand Canal for a place to eat...we didn't want a super fancy restaurant at the hotel to have lunch.  We passed the food court...and thought nah!  Saw Canonita and said, let's try Mexican in Vegas.  \n\nThe decor at Taqueria Canonita is characterized by high-ceilings, bright bold colors, Mexican tiles and Mexican art. Taqueria Canonita offers outside patio dining beside the Grand Canal which offers views of the Venetian streetscape and passing gondolas.\n\nWe started with guacomole and chips.  The guac was fantastic...I could have just eaten that with a spoon.  Great texture, very chunky and flavorful.  My entree was thePescado Vera Cruz - fresh catch of the day (happened to be Mahi Mahi that day) sauteed w/ sweet chiles, red onions, green olives, and lemon all simmered with a hearty marisco broth and white rice.  It was yummy.  I'd get that again if I wanted to eat on the light said.  \n\nHe ordered the Colima Pollo con Limon - grilled chicken breast marinated w/ lime and roasted garlic topped w/ chayote and red cabbage salad, seasonal grilled vegetable and borracho beans.  I wish I had ordered that instead.  Not only did it look yummy, it was great!  The chicken was tender and juicy.\n\nTotal bill with tip:  $58"
1,"Well I had pizza from this establishment the other day at my job. The nice people from Peak Data ordered pizza for everyone.....and I must say it was simply delicious. They ordered several different kinds....but my favorite was the veggie.....and the cheese pizzas. I mean the toppings were over the top....which is great.....and the Wheat crust....that's right a wheat crust....was simply delightful. I am going again tomorrow night to try the buffalo chicken.....or maybe the pesto chicken....or maybe the all mushroom pizza....LOL....haven't decided yet. However when I do I will update this review and give you the 411 on whichever one....two...or maybe even 3 pizzas i try. Eat, Drink, and be Merry, my Friends!!!!!"
1,"I am super fan.  I have been hitting this place up for about two years...Yeah, I know I need to submit my reviews faster.  SMH.  Its terrible.  Sorry for the rant.  Every time I set foot in this building, I great customer service with quick, healthy food.  I have no compliments, just praise for this location.  \n\nFour thumbs up!!!!"
1,"I'm going to jump on the 5 star bandwagon here. And for one simple reason:\n\nMACARONS.\n\nOccasionally, the Mr will bring me a delightful, sweet offering after visiting the 7th Street Public Market. More often than not, it's a toothsome treat from barCHOCOLATE. Yesterday, I received a hazelnut macaron and a key lime macaron.\n\nAnd I fell in love with the key lime macaron. I shared with the Mr, but not because I wanted to. I wanted to savor every last morsel of the thing.\n\nI don't know what sorcery they use to create their macarons. And I don't care. I just want another one. Right now."
0,"The lobster rolls are ok, the style is non traditional I'm told, still tastes fine to me. Bread was pretty deliciously seasoned and toasty.  It comes in two sizes, either large or extra large. The rolls are neither. Portions are small, could easily eat two. If you're going to call something large it better be freaking large. If they called it regular and large, I would of felt less ripped off. You're seated in the middle of a mall, so there's some decent people watching, if you're into that. They had some pretty fine females inside the bebe store. Highlight of the meal. \n\nWe ended up going to earl of sandwich immediately after because we were still hungry."
0,"Ranks poorly against some of the great Thai restaurants I have visited. The food lacked flavor and color ( Anemic ), The vegetables were of poor quality and a BBQ Chicken we ordered was yellow ? pounded too thin and of questionable quality. Would have enjoyed a non fried appetizer ? some refreshing spring rolls would have been appreciated. We did order some tasty fried calamari, probably the highlight of this forgettable meal. Nothing about this place, including service gave me the impression we would return."
0,I only tolerate the teribble food and terrible service because I only come when I eat for free.  Yes they need to pay you to eat there.  Now the cafe isn't too bad if u want decent food but they are really slow serving at both places... well the buffet can't be slow since you grab your own food... but now the drink... different story.... even though the staff and service is slow... they are really nice.  I would come back again to eat on the house.  The best thing in their brunch is the donuts which is terrible to say knowing they probably didn't make it.   Since I'm filipina... it made sense for me to enjoy the corned beef hash with white rice.  They are Terrible they have to own up to their name!
0,"AWFUL.  Not sure it classifies as food.  Burrito consists of a flour tortilla and meat.  No salsa, beans, cheese, sour cream, guacamole.  Nada.  Plus they won't let you add anything to it.  Everything is as is.  The cheese enchalada had cheese but it was not gooey and melted.  The food was barely luke warm.   Service is also mediocre.  The salsa was gross.  It was super water down.  The best part of the meal was my Pepsi."
0,yelp suggested it and it's out of business!! there was a note on the door saying the landlord was taking back the property.
0,"I would like to think that my friends have a great taste in their food and restaurant choices. But, maybe I am just not a fan.  \n\nThe story goes like this: I dropped in for lunch and I wasn't convinced. Then, I dropped in for dinner and I still left unconvinced. --For lunch I went with the (Banh Mi) LemonGrass Chicken. A couple weeks later I had the dinner option and we went for the Peking Duck steamed buns, Smoked Bok Choy dumplings and Thai Kale salad. -- The Thai Kale salad was quite delectable. All things said and done, the drinks were very tasty and the ambiance of the Clever Koi is amazing.  But it's going to take more convincing than that to keep me coming back for more."
1,Best shop in Vegas . I refuse to go to any other shop. The costumer service is the best I've ever had. The asians are nice too.
0,"I always forget about this location, but it's been here for ages- BF used to live nearby and would walk here to get fries late at night. As it is, a craving for fries is what brought me to their drive thru today in the first place. BF caught sight of their new featured brisket burger and insisted on getting a combo. \n\nWhen we got to the window, I asked to add on an order of potato bites but the manager-looking guy who was helping us said it would be a good 5 minutes or so because he had to make them fresh. I thanked him for the heads up and declined the add on.\n\nWhen we got down the street to a red light, I stuck my hand in the bag to get some fries. And they were stale and cold. Dude, if you have the foresight to warn me about the potato cakes, I should have received the same heads-up about my fries. I think it's safe to reasonably expect fries that are at least warm, but clearly this location can't handle that.\n\nThe burger also was lukewarm, but the flavors were actually fairly good, all things considered. I continue to wonder how they're still in business seeing as how they rarely have customers and serve cold food.."
1,"It had a super buffet for a Saturday!  I loved every morsel of it.\nKeep in mind it's south Indian so it'll be on the spicy side,  But everything has amazingly bold flavors. The staff were so nice, they helped my grown daughter choose her food since she is new to Indian food and doesn't like spicy.\n I'll definitely be back.\nGo try it!"
1,"I will dream about their Cesar salad for a long, long time. It was not a traditional Cesar.  No it was more heavenly.  It had kale and incredible bacon.  Capers and a fantastic dressing.  It was a mountain of deliciousness.  I fear that when in Montreal I will eat this salad three meals a day and miss out on all other culinary experiences.  It had an addictive quality.  I have to think of something else now or the physical cravings will take hold.\n\nMy husband had a cuban sandwich that was sensational.  Salty goodness.  Great bread.  He also had a fantastic white beer from Italy of all places.  \n\nMy croissant was not outstanding but good.\n\nOur waitress was a gem.  Super friendly.  \n\nI am not sure how our lunch turned out to be $50, but it was well worth it."

1,"This is always a great place to take my son when it's time to cool down...he loves to play at the train table in the children's area.  Afterwards, he picks 2 books, we read them and go home.  I'm surprised this place stays in business considering people just read there and then leave - but until it does, we will keep coming to do the same.  This place was definitely better than Border's when it was still around."
1,"Yesterday I went for a smog test for my car, spent about 10 minutes withs a lovely old guy, who as so bored ( I was his only client all day) he not to tell me the story of his life, no that was not that great, he learn his lessons a little to late, but I learn right in time that I can renew the registration of my car in less that two minutes! \nI have no idea who deserves the credit, but what a great idea this was! A DMV kiosks right inside a very popular store! \nSorry I don't shop here, but I will see you again next year to renew my registration without waisting a day in line at DMV :)"
1,Love the convenience of the redbox and inexpensive products! Staff is always helpful when i go in....
0,"This has been the worst experience EVER!  The hotel was dirty with a roach crawling across our room.  Mold in the bath room.  To add insult to injury, they have charged us for 3 nights even though we only stayed 2. They acknowledge we were there for 2 and that we paid for 2 but the reservation was through Priceline and the dates were wrong so they were billing us an extra day - totally frustrating!  Don't bother.  The lack of Customer Service is appalling!  This experience has been the worst hotel stay I've ever had."
1,"Bun Bo Hue: Awesome\nCrab Noodle Soup: Really awesome, and rare! I've never seen this at a Vietnamese Pho place! The broth was amazing, and you will love this.\nPho: Above average\nBeef Stew: Very thick broth, so be ready. It's good, though!"
1,"As recent Los Angeles transplants, this has become our favorite place in Las Vegas to grab dinner to go. The Chicken Tikka is amazing and the Saag Paneer is one of our favorites that no one ever mentions. Can't recommend Mt Everest enough."

1,"This place is like McDonalds for me. Its consistent good. It's not the best quality kbbq meat, but it's damn good, and good enough. The meat drippings fall onto all that kimchee and bean sprouts which they use for an excellent heart stopping fried rice at the end. \n\nThis time my family of 4 ordered a combo for 3-4 and the blood sausage soup (best here). Didn't even make it to the rice at the end. Totally stuffed and completely satisfied. \n\nAmazingly, the male server was very polite and attentive too. He needs to teach those ladies how to do things."
0,"I am giving two stars and writing my review later, only because I know I will forget the name of this place by tomorrow.  That should explain everything. Either I want to forget this place, or it will happen on its own."
0,The place only rates one star but gave them a second star just because they have some other beers available besides their own terrible ones that don't taste like toefungus. Food was average at best. as was the service.  One would have hoped a repackeaged Electric Dave's would improve itself but alas it hasn't.  Plenty of other options on Mill Ave or Four Peaks that are so much better.  Just a matter of time before this place closes it doors.
1,"This locally owned fast casual Mexican joint features quality food and reasonable prices. My personal favorite is the chorizo and eggs torta, but you really can't go wrong with any of the Mexican sandwiches."
0,We ordered from them mid day during the week for delivery.  It took 2 hours and our pizza was cold.  We were told by the manager that they would give us a free pizza.  We called back a few days later to order and there was no record of the incident.\n\nWe will never return.
1,"My wife, kids, and mom and I ate here Friday night.  We had the chips and salsa, crab tostadas, quesadillas, tamales, shrimp and steak fajitas, and tortilla soup.  The chips were the only thing that were not good.  They were just okay.   Everything else was fantastic.  My wife enjoyed her big stick margarita, I enjoyed my margarita primero, and my mom enjoyed her classic margarita.  The most tasty items were the steak with the steak fajitas, the crab tostadas, and the tamales.  The salsas were very good too.\n\nThis local will go back to Segundo again!\n\nKid friendly too."
1,"I went into Moe's today and didn't get the usual \""WELCOME TO MOE'S!!!\"" and you know what? That made me sad. Have they stopped doing this? I've always enjoyed being yelled at when I walk into an establishment but I guess others don't.\n\n Anywho, this is a pretty standard Moe's but it's baller status in my book because they have an outdoor patio on the side. Plus they give you free chips and have a variety of salsa to try. They even have one named the El Guapo and any salsa named after a character in Three Amigos rocks my world. Definitely stop in for Moe Monday--burrito, chips and a drink for $5--nothing wrong with that!"
0,Don't get take out during dinner. $10 for medium sized sweet and sour dish. It doesn't even come with an eggroll.  Their lunch dishes are cheaper and have more food! What a ripp off.
0,"First, if your a Dodgers fan you will love this park.  I'm a STL fan and love the game of baseball in general especially spring training.\n\nWe went to the Friday night game and watched the Dodgers and the Giants.  It was a good game and I enjoyed hanging out with the family in the lawn seats.  There was over 11,000 fans at the game.\n\nThe game start time was 705PM and I don't recommend going to a night game here.  Getting to the ballpark is a hassle during this time because you are going to get caught up with rush hour traffic. \n\nThe concession stands had long lines at least until the 4th inning.  The prices were typical of a major event.  Food was decent.  I enjoyed chicken tenders and fries for $6.75.  \n\nAt the end of the game they had a post game fireworks show.  It was awesome and I think it takes place on Friday's if there is a night game.\n\nOverall, I won't be attending this ball park again for spring training.  It doesn't give you the spring training feel.  Its too big. However, It does offer an up close experience to the batting cages, practice fields and the Dodger players around the lake.\n\nIn closing, the tickets to the games are too expensive for a spring training game and it doesn't even offer a spring training experience."
1,"Just delicious. We dropped in here after a hike to Arthur's seat, and it was so nice to get in somewhere warm and cosy! Love their half soup / half sandwich combo. I also tried their chicken and leek pasty - yum, with an amazing side salad."
0,"The owners of Paradise Bakery need to take a close look at this one. It's in an airport and it's just inside security. I wanted an iced tea. For a restaurant chain that does this pretty well at their other stores, with brewed tea ready, I thought it was a no-brainer. Yikes, was I wrong?\n\nFirst, to get the one person to ring me up and get a cup was a challenge. It took way longer than it should have. They don't care. Then, when I asked for a lemon for my tea I was informed the lemons are only for salads. HUH? Such crap. Make a customer happy and give her a freaking lemon. Power trip.\n\nThen I took a sip of my tea and promptly dropped it in the nearest trash can. I want my $2.50 back.\n\nParadise Bakery owners - get this location straightened out. It gives you a bad name."

1,"I love everything at the Greek Bistro but my favorite are the Gyro wrap (the meet is sooo fresh) and feta fries!!!!!!!!!!! I am from LA but when I go to Vegas my first stop is always at the Greek Bistro. Amazing food and best service. \n\nP.s.  I give 5 stars for the cleanness of the place, 5 stars for service, and 5 stars for the food!!!!"
1,"This is such a beautiful park! I won't reiterate the amenities most of the other reviews have pointed out, but the rec center is really clean and there's a lot of activities inside as well. I have yet to take advantage of their trails and picnic areas, though I will definitely make it a point to do so!"
0,"I can't say I had a great time here. A bit pricey and not a lot to show for it. If you're planning to trade in your clothing and accessories for cash, know that they pay lives up to the title \""cheapskate\"". $8 cash for a bag they resold for 9 times what they paid me? Give me a break."
0,"This place sucked when I was like 12 and stayed here with my parents, and it still sucks at age 23.  We came for a friend's bachelor party weekend, and when we walked in the smoke detector was hanging from its wires off the ceiling and the room reeked of disinfectant.  Which is funny, since shortly thereafter the room began smelling of dudes, and didn't really stop being that way until we checked out.  On top of that, they wanted to charge us like $10.00 per-person-per-day  to use their ratty gym and $40.00 a night to use a roll-out bed - seriously nickel and diming the shit out of us.\n\nAlso, the one time we went downstairs and bought a pizza they forgot about our order after we stood around for nearly half an hour and then were totally unapologetic about it, and at any given hour during that weekend we couldn't find a $10.00 blackjack table to save our lives.  Luckily the Monte Carlo pulled through hard for us on that front. Overall just a horrible end-to-end service experience."
1,"For my first trip to Las Vegas, my boyfriend and I decided to stay at the Bellagio. I had read really great reviews, and really bad reviews, so I didn't really know what to expect.\n\nI loved staying here. Check in was fast; our room was ready at 11am. We had a partial lakeview on the 25th floor in the spa tower that had a great view of pretty much the whole fountain show and the strip. The room was updated, except for the tv, but I wasn't there to watch tv anyways. The bathroom was nice-stone counters and floors, seperate soaking tub and shower. The bed was one of the most comfortable beds I have ever slept in. Loved the motorized blackout drapes; if only I could install them in our apartment.\n\nThe service was really great. Every employee we encountered asked if we needed something, especially room service. I enjoyed the casino a lot as well, it had a nice variety of slots and table games. \n\nSomething we  were disappointed in was the selection of late night eating. They have the Cafe Bellagio, but it is sit down and at 3am you just want quick eats. Thank god for the 24 newstand shop and its selection of chips and candy...ok and selection of alcohol too.\n\nWe will definitely stay here again in the future."
0,Was charged $84 for an oil change. Absolutely unacceptable. I paid $84 for someone to pour 5 gallons of oil into my car. Unbelievable.
0,Not too impressed with this buffet. Price wise it's pretty reasonable but personally I still don't think its worth the money for me. By all means please do not let that stop you from going. I just like more variety and better tasting food. The best thing I found was the prime tube even though there is not a lot of flavor.
0,"Horrible service and the worst part the sushi was below mediocre. Yen or Wasabi are much better options. (worth the wait)\n\nWhen we received our appetizer we had to ask for plates. Then the worst part the runner brings our sushi out and no sign of the waitress for thirty minutes. Her name: Hannah.\n\nI look around for her or someone, she is nowhere to be seen. I get up and go to the sushi bar and get my own dishes. Otherwise we'd be eating sushi with no wasabi,  ginger, or soy sauce. \n\nI ask to speak to the manger and he is pretending to write something down like he was taking notes and asked if we wanted an appetizer. Um no sir we only saw the waitress after we were done eating, why would we want an appetizer or drink when we are leaving. \n\nHe says well next time you come in tell me and we'll do something for you. \n\nNext time I come in? That would be a never ever! \n\nTacky place. If you're a early twenty something's westsider who doesn't care for sushi then this is your place."
0,This place is terrible! New owners or not still bad! Menu is so limited for AYCE they charge extra for anything additional... Their is a lot of Sushi places on town and feel that this place is well below PAR!
0,"I've decided to completely write this place off, and here is why you should too:\n\nTHREE TIMES I have tried to go here and they have been closed, all the while their website and posted hours say they should be open. If one of you wants to drive all the way here from the suburbs, you'd better call first because this place cannot be trusted. I've wasted my time and spent hungry minutes walking here only to be disappointed. \n\nVitamin T will fail, there I said it."
0,"After reading so many positive reviews, I expected much more from this place.  While the dish presentations were attractive and the flatbread was pretty good, the rest of our experience was unimpressive.  There are many other restaurants I would visit before considering a return to Eno Vino."
1,"Came for lunch with my BF and his friend. \n\nWe shared:\n\nAntipasto plate ($12)- salami, olives, fresh mozzarella, roasted garlic red peppers, bread.  Pretty good, but antipasto is pretty standard. \n\nPizza with mushrooms and meatball (lrg- $14, + 4 for toppings) - the meatball was more thin sliced onto the za than mini rounds I was expecting. It was pretty good thin crust for a chain. It was crispy with good char on the bottom, but a bit chewy and the sauce was good. Apparently they recreate the conditions of the Brooklyn water to get the crust right. The only drawback is the large size- it means I need to plan for friends to come along if I want some Grimaldi's.\n\nOur server was friendly, personable and attentive. Our server asked if we want a bit of greens to go with it (doesn't come with it and no charge for some if you want it) and brought that out with some vinaigrette and that did help the antipasto be better. Our drinks were kept up on and we were checked on throughout. \n\nIt was my first time at a Grimaldi's and I think I like this. There's one closer to our house so I think I'm gonna head to that one."
1,i have loved this Chinese restaurant for the past ten years these guys know how to make hot and sour soup and the strawberry chicken is not only one of a kind but delicious.
0,"Don't waste your time or money.  I wish I had read the reviews before we had lunch here!!  Had a friend in town visiting and we thought we would give this place a try.  Once seated you feel as if you are sitting in a cafeteria.  Uncomfortable chairs and cheap wobbly tables.  I ordered a turkey burger and my friend decided on the spaghetti and meatballs.  Our waitress came back to our table about 5 minutes later to let me know that they were out of turkey burgers.  I told her that I would have the club sandwich then.  She proceeded to tell me they were out of those as well.  I finally settled on a hamburger.  As we sat and chatted a waiter tried to deliver us another tables food.  When our food did come it was nothing special, you could get the same thing at any fast food joint; and my friends spaghetti looked like it had been poured out of a can.  Atmosphere was poor... As we ate I watched as other patrons were being seated at dirty tables.  The service staff seemed as if they had not ever been trained.  Atmosphere bad, service bad, food TERRIBLE.  $70 dollars later we headed to leave and we were greeted by the manager who said \""come again\"".  That definitely won't be happening!!"
0,Very small restaurant. Went for lunch and ordered a chicken salad and it was very bland. I may try this place again as most of the reviews on here are great...but the salad was definitely nothing special.
1,"We've had a minor issue with our order but the staff took care of it right away. No questions asked. Even the cook apologized. Exceptional customer service! We've never been to a Pho place with this kind of awesome service. On top of that, the food is superbly good! My new favorite is seafood noodles. We will definitely come back!"
1,"Really enjoyed food was very surprised by the amount of people that were at the location. Great taco Tuesday idea, felt warm and friendly. Had two $1 tacos and 2 carne asada. I will def be going back to dine in and request hotter salsa! Lots of flavor and felt like home"
1,So good!!! We went as a group and everyone loved the food they ordered.  The food was very reasonably priced!! Yum!
1,"Yelp's 365 Review Challenge 2014 #288 - #365\n\nWe were staying at Encore and they decided to eat at Makino  AYCE dinner because it was cheaper than eating on the strip, especially at Encore. Located about 10 minutes from the strip in a mediocre area of Vegas. I don't know the price per head because I didn't pay, Woot! \n\nThis isn't just any kind of buffet but a Japanese Buffet. It was just average and the sashimi didn't taste fresh at all and I'm glad I didn't try to beef because several people in our party got food poisoning! they did have a great selection of sushi rolls and most of them had a lil too much rice and less fish. I would come back to give it another try."
1,"Yum, yum, yummy.  You'll want to check these folks out!  They have been on Groupon a few times and you get lots of food for the money.  Really, if there were such a thing as a 'to go' bag for breakfast, you'll need it.  Great tasting skillets, wonderful hamburgers and a genuinely friendly, helpful staff. They made us feel at home and that's every time (have been there three times) we've gone.  They don't get upset about Groupon and stop to chat if you're willing.  This place reminds me of what diners used to be.  Try it!"
1,Great Food!  HUGE Portions!
1,"Pleasantly surprised.  Stopped in for lunch today and got their pizza by the slice.  Now usually when you go to a pizza place and get the pizza by the slice it is dry and has that \""been sitting under a heat lamp for 4 hours\"" taste.  This pizza did not.  It was just the right temp, the pepperoni was perfectly crispy (a huge plus for me) and there was an awesome amount of cheese compared to sauce (not big on sauce in general, so I am always happy to find a place that doesn't drown the pie in sauce).  Grabbed some ranch for the crust.. The ranch was a great consistency and had nice season to it.\n\nI'd go back."
0,"I too like Sub Station's food... But not when I get it from this particular store. It kinda makes my skin crawl. They also don't seem to have room for the bread toaster any longer like the other stores do, which I would attribute to the horde of personal items they have stacked behind the counter... Hundreds of old VHS tapes!? They don't keep the tables clean, the dining area is in DESPERATE need of some TLC. Broken video games, old dusty house plants, peeling paint. Looks like they just don't care and I have no idea how they've made it past the health inspector this long. GO TO A DIFFERENT SUB STATION, NOT HERE!"
0,"we came by for lunch after checking out. i wanted nachos and mama wanted a salad. i figured this would be an ideal spot to facilitate those needs.\n\nthe hostess who sat us was not very pleasant. she tried to seat us at the bar section, on a bar table. mind you, we have our luggage with us and didn't ask to be seated at the bar. when i asked her for a dining room booth, she looked less than thrilled to be burdened with this task. she may have even rolled her eyes behind her glasses. \n\nour server was a nicer individual. we ordered nachos and mama had a cobb salad. mama gets picky with her orders sometimes. this time she didn't get \""too\"" picky. she did ask for NO bleu cheese though. we thought it was simple enough. i also asked for a lemon for my water. needless to say, i point those items out because they were not accomplished. the nachos were good and mama tolerated her salad. we ordered dessert, the brownie with ice cream. that was real good. \n\nwould've gone with 3 stars, cause the server was nice. but, the hostess and the missed items make me have to drop one. call it 2.5"
0,"Monday June 2, 2014 - 2pm The food was a 10+, the service was -0!!!! We were hardly greeted as we came in, the place was not busy. The waitress acted as if she was doing us a favor by taking our order. The waitress, bar tender and cook (3females) acted as if we walked into their personal homes and treated us as unwelcome guests. We order the lobster roll and the spinach salad. Both were exceptional! The place was charming but the help was less than charming. We paid and said keep the change, which was a generous tip especially considering the lack of service. Not even a thank you from waitress!!!!\nThe people responding to the negative wait staff and saying the service is great, are obviously friends or staffers themselves. The reactions to the comments  are way to personal to be \""Joe Schmo\"" customer review."
0,"Decided to give BBQ King a try after seeing it on Diners Drive-Ins and Dives. I was really wanting to like this place. It looked cool on the show and the fried BBQ chicken was supposed to be the best. Complete failure the moment we arrived. I pressed the button on the 1950s speaker system to order and the lady snapped on the other side was about as rude as rude gets. \""I can't hear you\"" in a rude hateful voice. I wondered if I was in Charlotte or NYC. I had to contain myself from pulling her through that speaker system. Wow lady, the speaker system is from the 50s, no wonder you couldn't hear me. What I wanted was a BBQ fried chicken sandwich, but what I got was BBQ grilled tenders sandwich. Meat was too salty and the hush puppies were just ok, nothing good. Def won't be going back."
0,"Yes, Dollar has the best rates for booking a rental car in Vegas. What you don't know is that you'll end up waiting in line for about an hour at the rental counter to get a car while people going to every other car company will be off gambling/boozing/eating within minutes.\n\nWas it worth saving $20 total to wait in line at 1:00 am? Hell no. The iPhone and Travelocity had me booked at Avis for the same care (at $20 more per week) in 5 minutes ... and we were on our way. Bottom line, screw Dollar and make up the $20 by gambling for the additional hour."
0,"I wish I could give CVS Pharmacy a better rating.  I have been a customer of their's for years.  But I have to be honest in the past year if there were another Pharmacy near me that took my health plan I would try them instead.  Lately it seems as if CVS wants you to do the work for them.  You have to keep track of the prescriptions to make sure they are filled and sent to them by your doctor.  You have to be the one to go to yet another CVS Pharmacy location if they don't have the medication, have no plans to get the medication any time soon.  Has this pharmacy ever heard of something called a courier service which would take a drug from one store location to another, obviously not.  Then there is the fact that you go to this pharmacy wait in line and then have them ignore you for about five minutes, if not more before they acknowledge your presence.  Then I kid you not there was a situation where I was at the counter, and the person waiting on me actually went to someone else.  Yes, the person behind me was given better service then I was. Like I said they should be grateful they are the only pharmacy that I have within walking distance, otherwise I would take my business elsewhere."
0,"Hadn't been here in a while but now I know why, what a faded glory.   The place is tired and dated.  The food while quality has also faded.   Spring rolls under cooked, sesame ahi was tasteless and how do you run out of spicy mustard."
0,"Do not stay here!! Both the grounds and the staff are not accommodating at all. Has been a horror story.\nHas tube tv's, cannot regulate room temperature or water temperature, is very ill lit and has very slow wireless. \nBrought up complaints to management to no avail. Front desk staff was very nice but management has no idea about customer service."
1,The best place to the country to have you Ferrari services. All the service guys are awesome. They are honest and they do a good job. I bring my car here from California for service. I'm not the only guy that does that. There is a reason.
1,"If you dare, go for the Voodoo combo.  Voodoo Monkey Stout & chase it down with the Voodoo Killer burger.  The burger was hot as hell but well worth the pain.  The staff was quick & the suggestion of Pedros Nachos was spot on.  It fills up fast but you'll be glad you hung out.  One of the guys got the Beer Camp and was the envy of the rest of the table."
0,"Wish this review could be about the actual food here but unfortunately we didn't get to experience any on our visit here Sunday.   After we were seated at one of the seats at a table (not at the bar because they were full), we were just forgotten about.   None of the servers even left the bar/kitchen are during the entire 20 minutes we sat waiting to get served.  Not even a drink order or anything!  It's not like sat ourselves.  Someone definitely told us to take that table so somebody should've known we were there.   After 20 minutes of not even being acknowledged we stood up hoping to get a servers attention and still nothing so we left the place."
1,"Excellent food. They serve chips with bean dip and salsa. Typically, bean dip is an okay thin for me, but I do especially like the bean dip here. It has great flavor and has a slight kick to it.\n\nThey have good lunch specials daily, and so far I've liked all of them.\n\nAside from the lunch specials, I've had the Carne Asada and Fajitas. Both were fabulous! I haven't veered from those yet because I love them too much.\n\nThe staff are pleasant and friendly. Today, the hostess seemed a little timid, but still pleasant.\n\nI definitely recommend this place for excellent food at a reasonable prices."
1,"I've only had one thing here- the halo-halo (Filipino dessert featuring a myriad of mixed ingredients- describe soon), but it is the mother of all halo-halo's! While working at Weststar, a co-worker made a run to Chow King in he Seafood City store for lunch and told me that the halo-halo was really good. She got me the large one, for a little over $5- looks like a big gulp cup at 7-11. I didn't know it would be that big. Yup, I skipped dinner that night. It's big enough to share. It comes with a boba straw (wider than drink straws) and a long spoon. There is a small size available too.  \n\nI am picky about my Filipino food, but I do love many of the desserts. This is one of my favorites. Imagine many layers of toppings like corn, makapuno (young coconut strings), several kinds of beans, coconut gel squares (sweet), langka (sticky jackfruit- no other english translation), lime jello, interspersed with shaved ice and topped with a scoop of ube (purple yam) ice cream. I know that this combination might sound weird to a non-Filipino, but trust me, it really works. The beans and corn really balance out all the sweet stuff. You use the straw initially to drink the sweet purple-pink juice and once you get the cover off, you can mix it up as you eat it, using the spoon. I hope that this review helps and will foster your curiosity to have one. \n\nAfter shopping today at Pier 1 Imports, my husband (who was at Best Buy) surprised me with the large one. Isn't he sweet? He knew that I'd been jonesing for one, since summer started. Hence, inspired me to write this review.  \n\nThis place is always so busy. The parking lot is always full. Yes, this whole store is so popular with my peeps, so much that my mother-in-law always mentions how the parking (shared with) Jason's Deli's customers is near-impossible to find. Very convenient to shopping- Best Buy, Pier 1, Hallmark, Barnes & Noble, among others in this strip mall. Across the street is Target & Walgreen's. Next strip mall over is TJ Maxx, in the other direction is Marshall's and  the Boulevard Mall."
0,"I'll give half star if I can. LOVE is my third Cirque du Soleil show. I've seen KA and O. LOVE is definitely the worst one I've ever seen so far. My husband and I spent $126 per person to get the front row seat. The show is soooooooo boring and my husband fell asleep during the show. The music is re-mixed and just way too loud. Sometimes I can't hear what they sing clearly. The dancing was not bad. I guess if you are the Beatles fan, you'll enjoy the show much more. If you are not the big fan of Beatles, then just buy a CD would be totally enough. Do not waste your time and money for the show."
1,"I am so glad to find Hot Wok--finally, Chinese food that is delicious and close to home--a good option for take-out or delivery, and it's open late.  They call it N.Y. Style, and maybe that's why I like it so much.  I love the Shrimp w/ Eggplant w/ garlic sauce.  I get it most every time I order."
0,"I booked a ride to MCarran for an early flight.  I managed to find the side of the hotel where the shuttle would be and met the driver.  The driver grabbed my suitcase from me even though I would not let go of it and stated I wanted to place it in the back of the van myself.  In response the driver through the bag into the back with such force that the front of the cloth suitcase ripped.  On route to the airport the driver would not turn on any ventilation for a full shuttle, and I started choking on particulate matter in the cabin's air.  Finally the driver relented and turned on the air, but I didn't stop choking.  Later the next day, I developed a full blown attack of bronchitis from what I had breathed in.\n\nI contacted the company for resolution and even sent them pictures of my damaged bag.  They refused to do anything, and finally sent me a propaganda letter stating that they were not at fault for anything, and I had not proved my suitcase damage even though I saw the driver throw my bag and heard the rip of the suitcase.\n\nI would recommend anyone avoid Airline Shuttle Corp. if you value either your property or your health or your peace of mind.  However, if you decide to take the risk, I recommend that you have your camera out to take picture of the driver throwing suitcases and the inevitable damage.  I would also recommend that you have the number for Las Vegas police handy so you can call them to file an on spot report as proof of the damage.  Finally, I would recommend that you bring a face mask so as not to breathe in the dust, cleaning fluids, and particulate matter in case the driver is angry and doesn't feel like turning on the ventilation, and he will be angry if you insist on handling your own suitcase.\n\nThe driver also failed to mention anything at the airport like where one could most efficiently check their bags, but I would  think you would have to be dreaming to receive that kind of value added  from this company.  In fact, you should thank your lucky stars if your property or health are not damaged  on route to the airport.\n\nFinally, I am only giving one star as that is the lowest rating offered, but I believe that they deserve -5 stars and should not be allowed to remain in business.  I would also question the positive reviews which may have been planted by management as having communicated with them regarding my damages, I think they have a totally cynically view, and don't care at all about how they abuse and hurt passengers."
1,"I stop at this McD's sometimes for breakfast when Im in a hurry and they always impress me!  The service is always fast (I always use the drive-through) and my food has been hot and fresh every time.\nIve not been inside, so I cant speak for that aspect, but the service and food quality is above average in my opinion for McDonalds.\n\nNot sure what that other review is all about... I mean really, who drives 15 mins to a late night McD's for a coke (and doesnt immediately taste it when the get it! LOL)...??"
0,"This review is for an after party hosted by my organization.  The place is new and clean.  The theme is nice as well as the decorations that come with it.  On Saturday night we held an event for an after party to a dance competition.  We had over 200+ people signed up for attendance for a place that holds 250 people at capacity.  The event was a social/dance event with a DJ and drinks.  \n\nThe night of the event I got there at 11pm.  There was a line at the door.  I got to the front of this line and was informed that they were at capacity and they were adhering to \""one-in, one-out\"" rule.  Meaning I had to wait for someone to leave before I could enter.  The total wait time ended up being 45mins!  We had some guests that got only 40 mins of party time cause of the long wait. Disappointed, freezing cold guests plus very rude bouncers does not make for a good party.  \n\nOn top of all this, I find out that they were not at capacity, they just low-balled our attendance keeping only 2 bartenders on staff that night.  That is the reason half the place was still empty and that is the reason only half our guests could not enter.  \n\nI have to admit this was a last choice venue for us. But in all honesty the review is fair on all accounts."
0,"My boyfriend and I ate here one Friday night for dinner. I made reservations but I certainly didn't need to because the place was dead. We ended up sitting outside since the weather was perfect. The service was horribly slow. While we were sitting there we saw a couple go in and about 15 minutes later walk out with the manager chasing after them apologizing that no one had come to take their orders.\n\nI got the Guru Roll and while it was good...the only thing I could taste was the garlic. This place is way over priced as well. Our bill came out to over $80 for a salad, two rolls and two drinks. \n\nSave yourself the hassle and just walk next door to Rooster's."
1,"I shot Evan a message on Facebook. He reached out with his cell phone. We scheduled a service call for the next morning. He showed up right on time, acted polite and professional and got the job done at the price he quoted. Easy Peazey!"
1,"Using my Palms coupon book to the maxxxx. After Nathan's we decide on some fro'yo for dessert! I got the TART - YUM! I love it... Like Cherry on Top but not AS tart and no funky after taste like Cefiore. \nGood topping like strawberry flavored popping boba bubbles!!! Omg YESSSS!!! Fresh fruit, strawberries, blueberries, etc and of course goodies like gummy bears, sour worms, m&m's. Its definitely a NOM in my book!\nFour stars because seriously, they could CHOP up the strawberries instead of juat cutting them in half! It's hard to eat maaaaan!!!"
1,"I rolled into this restaurant in my wheelchair and order up a pizza. Upon getting the pizza I wasn't too enthused, looked rather ordinary. I have never been wrong in my life! The first bite filled my mouth with joyous glee. I remembered the greatest times of my life, I laughed, I cried. After I finished my last bite I wiped away the few remaining delicious crumbs from my mouth and walked out, WALKED out."
0,"I've given up and Pittsburgh barbeque, and was loathe to try Mr. Willie's.  How bad can it be, I asked.\n\nBad.\n\nOrdered the 16 piece barbeque chicken meal with three sides and cornbread.  The chicken was not grilled, or heaven forbid, actually smoked.  It was basic baked chicken, doused in barbecue sauce.   Not barbeque by a long shot.\n\nThe sides were awe-inspiring in their awfulness. Red beans and rice was simultaneously hot and bland, made with perhaps ketchup and hot sauce.  No celery, onions or peppers or thyme.  Like a rice-a-roni version of red beans and rice.\n\nThe greens were mixed kale and collards, and not inedible.  Bizarrely, the meat used in the greens was corned beef.  Traditionally, soul food greens include ham hocks or smoked turkey to give it that great musky, funky taste.  But corned beef seems to be some awkward concession to its Squirrel Hill location.  \n\nCornbread?  A hand wrapped two by two inch square of crumbly corn-bread in wax paper.  Looked inedible, and in fact was.\n\nService?  Awful.  Apparently the lukewarm write-ups from Munch and City Paper inspired him to try to increase business by grunting subaudibly to his customers.  Woo-hoo!  \n\nPrediction: the location turns into a kosher restaurant by March of 2009. And it's a shame.  Except in home kitchens, soul food is dead in Pittsburgh."
1,"This place has changed hands (and names) 3 times in the last three years, so when Malones took over from The Fat Cow I really didn't see it lasting that long. But I was wrong!\n\nThe inside looks like the standard Irish pub, with lots of dark wood and green and beige d\u00e9cor, but they've quirked it up a bit by painting famous quotes about all things Irish all over the walls which kept me entertained when my friend had nipped off to the loo. We perched in one of the high booths in the window, which offered a prime people-watching vantage point, but they have a whole load of sofas and tables throughout the huge downstairs area to choose from.\n\nDrinks are roughly \u00a33-4, which is more exensive than a lot o other bars in the area, but the service was fast and the beer was cold, so I didn't mind. We were only there for a few quiet afternoon drinks, but I've heard that it gets really lively in the evenings and from what I saw advertised they have regular ceilidh nights and live music evenings, which I will be sampling soon..."
1,This place is located a market full of stores which I love. I have been here 2-3 times and had a few of the breakfast sandwiches.  First thing I must say is everything I had was good they use only top end ingredients in their food.  My bacon egg & cheese on whole wheat tastes so fresh and was pretty big too.  It filled me up my sister had one the 4 speciality sandwhiches they make and I had a bite and it was great.  I cant wait to go back try some more items off the menu.  I also could see the bread they were making and can I just say the smell filled the room and made me even hungrier!
0,"The management here is absolutely terrible. We ordered a simple meal (chicken tenders and mozzarella sticks) which took close to two hours to recieve. When we asked to speak to a manager about the awful service, he snatched the plates from in front of us and said \""you no pay, you no eat.\"" There was clearly a communication issue, however as a manager that is unacceptable behavior. Take your business elsewhere. The food isn't that great anyway."
1,"Love the samosa factory. The staff are delightful, food delicious & such a pleasant atmosphere. I've taken family & friends here & everyone loved it. I'd recommend this to anyone looking for some delicious Indian food!"
0,Went to Sandbar on Sat. specifically because their website advertised happy hour from noon - 7:00pm.  When we asked our waitress about it she indicated the Sat. happy hour had been discontinued since Aug.  After 4 months they should have been able to update their website.  At this point it is becoming a case of false advertising!
0,"1st trip: Tried the appetizer sampler, which wasn't anything to write home about.  But it's OK, it was just an appetizer sampler, we weren't expecting anything spectacular.  What was really awful was the service.  As we walked in we couldn't find anyone, except someone watching TV.  So we waited there for a minute or two and finally sat ourselves.  Turns out the our waiter was the guy watching TV.  Throughout the whole evening the guy maybe visited us maybe 4 times, we couldn't even get him to take our money (still glued to the TV) so we left cash and walked out.\n\n2nd trip:  We decided to give the place a second chance because for some reason we thought the place was under new management.  Service similarly bad, waiter checked in on us more often but it still took a really long time just for the guy to run my credit card (no cash on me this time).  We had two waiters, first one messed up our orders several times on simple things like drinks--which they fixed.  The worst aspect of this evening was the food, the pizza we ordered tasted like a frozen Digiorno pizza, and not the fancy kind that taste good.  I left the restaurant convinced that the place is a cover for some sort of illicit activity.\n\nJust to make things clear: I hate giving 1 star reviews.  I'm a local and I like supporting local businesses, and there are a LOT of good restaurants in this area.  This is not one of them.  Not even remotely."
1,(7/8/13) Individual cupcakes get individual containers! What a great concept. I had been dreading a larger box that would get tossed around by my driving & destroying both the cupcake & the frosting. I bought a lemon cupcake on this visit. It was perfection.
1,"Yes, it's all true what's been said about Jennifer. She is THAT fantastic and definitely knows skincare. I've had two treatments done with her and am looking forward to going back to her on a regular basis. I have finally found my official esthetician. Her prices are reasonable, her treatments work (none of that extra fruffy stuff I don't need), and best of all she's not a product pusher. Though with her wealth of knowledge on skin care products, I couldn't help but ask her opinion on things. I love that she gives me honest answers about skin care lines. \n\nBasically, if you're looking for an honest person who will help you achieve great results with your skin, go see Jennifer. I'm so glad that she's here in the valley!"
0,"Not what to expect for a lounge/club in one of the largest hotels in Vegas. PH should invest in a much bigger venue to accommodate its guest. Staff was terrible and rude. They act like they own the place or they think its the Marquee. Wasn't impressed by the service either. Bar tenders are very very rude, well, you don't get tipped that way, or maybe I will never go back there. The place is so tiny which you feel you are running out of O2. Better yet, they have host at every corner of the casino trying to recruit people with rest band claiming a VIP treatment, once you hit the door, you find out that its all a HOAX. Bad marketing strategy."
0,"Warning!  Don't go on this ride if you just got back from Disneyland (Pirates of the Caribbean is much better) or have ridden in a real gondola before.  (Okay, so I rode on an authentic Venetian gondola on Lake Merritt in Oakland http://www.gondolaservizio.com/ and not in Venice).  No matter, this gondola ride was cheesy and a waste of money.  $16 PER PERSON for 15 minutes of sitting on a motorized boat shaped like a gondola going up and down a canal inside a mall is a rip off.  I know I know, no one forced me on this ride.  But I had to check it off my \""to-do\"" list and I was finally able to get two people to go on with me."
1,"Tried them this weekend and i was rather impressed. The burgers were good, and i would definitely try getting something other than a single. Fries were tasty, and well salted.  Personally i prefer thicker fries, but at the moment the shoe string fries did the trick.The dining area was nice and clean. The atmosphere is pretty cool, and their menu was pretty easy to get thru. \n\nMy wife had the custard and she said that it was great! One gripe is that they do not offer a No Sugar Added alternative.\n\nI would definitely go back!"
1,"I went there with a couple of buddies the first time we all did a trip to Vegas. They told me to pick a spot and since we were walking through Caesar's Palace, I just let my nose lead us. It led us to Trevi's. We all fell in love with the calamari!! Also the Crab/spinach/artichoke dip was awesome!!! The drink menu also has some very nice drinks on it. Since then I have been back to Vegas 3 times and every time we get off the plane, we drop off our stuff and go straight to Trevi's. But now we get the Fritto Misto!! Try it!!! My mouth waters every time we talk about it!! The place does get busy though.......so if you are impatient....go some where else!!!"
1,Go. Just. Go.  Ask your server for suggestions.  They are known for the unusual cold sashimi dishes.  We tried several and all were amazing.  The tadas were fun too!  Well worth the drive.  Easy from the strip!
1,The food is very tasty like the sesame chicken sweet and sour chicken all my favorite. Good thing is they deliver to your home.
0,"This company has switched owners, so everything you read below is based on a different restaurant/owner/menu.\n\nThey no longer accept Groupon, because as stated above, they've switched owners.  The menu items listed and shown in the pictures are no longer applicable.\n\nWe originally went to use a Groupon, but stayed to try the place after being told of the ownership change and no longer accepting Groupon...  big mistake.\n\nThe sausage link was actually a hot dog. *ugh* Soft, no flavor... a hot dog.\n\nThe French Dip was lacking and the au jus looked (and tasted) like meat drippings, not au jus.\n\nThe mac & cheese had too much pepper and lacked any flavor, other than the pepper.\n\nWe ordered a grilled cheese off the children's menu (for the kid in our group) and received mac & cheese instead.\n\nThey were offering a Happy Hour special when we got there, a free side with beer purchase.  Ordered beer, but the check didn't reflect the special.  When we mentioned it, they didn't do anything about it, but they did round up when splitting the bill.  The waitress had a Russian accent, so I'm not sure if she didn't understand or just didn't care.\n\nEither way, we wouldn't go back for the food or the service.  Good luck new owners."
1,Excellent food! Never had a bad meal or service here. I always get the take home classic pasta
1,"Before I review, I must say that for only going once, the impression left is very strong I very much recommend Su Vino. Before even talking about wine, the customer service focus is amazing. From all the Bridal Shows my fiance and I have been to, they are always so accommodating as far as costs for event rental and the way the owner handles business is great. I am currently in charge of our wedding rehearsal dinner/party, and this is the #1 spot I have set on my list. If we go through with it, it will be a blast. \n\n*As for our experience at the bar........*\n\nMy fiance and I went here on a Groupon about a year and a half ago. We haven't been back since. Its not our fault though, we've just been so busy.....sigh... Even without the Groupon, I would come by here, and we are planning on doing so shortly.  The wine tasting was great, and the platter we tried really added to wine pairing. Being a semi-wino, I enjoyed trying the varieties, while my fiance went right for the desert wines. Its nice to know they make in-house such a wide variety of wines for everyone to try,. \n\nConsidering the wines they make are privately made, and not \""mass-produced\"", the bottled wine to be purchased is also quite reasonable. The staff is friendly, and the ambiance of the location lends to a relaxing chill mood, rather than a fast paced guzzle-fest or a upper class snooty wine bar. We were able to play some fun board games while sipping on wines, and we stayed for a good couple hours just taking the location in and playing games. I can't wait to come back!!!!"
0,"I went in just to check it out, never went in before the new ownership .. My weakness are sugar cookies, they had pumpkin decorated cookies so I bought 2, $2 each.. Not bad , decent size and all... I took one bite and nearly broke my teeth! The royal icing was super hard.. Either the cookie is more than a week old or the icing has some\nSort of cement in the mix! It was terrible.. It did taste stale .. Everything in their display case looked like they've been sitting there for a while.. Usually when one walks into a bakery you expect to smell fresh baked goods, not at this place.. So with that said, who knows how old those cookies and cupcakes are when you spend good money for them.. Won't be back... Sorry ..."
0,"The staff is friendly and attentive.  The place is spotless.  The corn pancakes that are served when you are seated are very good.  Most of the food is overcooked and dry.  The waffle with the chicken and waffles was horrible-thin, overcooked, funny taste.  The prices are exhorbitant, especially for a strip mall and the size of the portions.  Went once, won't return."
0,"My Bulldog was having some discharge coming from her eye and it was clearly irritated. I wasn't sure if it was just conjunctivitis, the beginning of prolapse, or something else? \nI took her to Centennial Hills Animal Hospital, as it is the closest vet to my house and that is where my dog has had her shots and she has also been boarded there before. Other than sometimes having to wait a ridiculous amount of time somedays, I haven't had any complaints about CHAH, of course I haven't had any major issues with my dog before either. \n\nI was shown into a room where I waited for about 10 min. When a vet tech came in, not a vet. I had to tell her what was going on with my dogs eye, when she proceeded to look right at her eye and tell me that it wasn't conjunctivitis and then tell me she would be back with my dog because she was going to take her in the back and have the vet do a stain on the eye to make sure there wasn't a cut on the eye. \nUm, what? So just like that, I don't even get to talk to a vet at all, and you are telling me what is not wrong with my dogs eye!! \nThen about 10 min. later the vet tech returns with a price break down of the high and low costs of the tests that they want to do to my dogs eye, but wait I haven't even seen or talked to a vet yet!!! Then she says also your dogs feet don't look normal so you should have us test those too! Huh? I am here for her eye, and I am just trying to see a fricking VET, and I am only getting a vet tech! What the heck! I told her I would have to call my husband and review all the costs with him. \nAbout 10 min. later the Vet, Brady Vanderlind finally comes in! He then goes over the high and low costs of the tests they want to do and makes me sign on the test I choose. Then he goes and finally does the eye stain. The whole time my poor dog was in the back probably freaking out :-/ \nWhen they are done with the eye stain the vet tech brings my dog back into the room and takes her foot and says are you you don't want us to test this, because its NOT normal! NO, I don't want you to test my dogs feet! I know what it is, and despite what you think, I am not a moron! \nDr. Vanderlind prescribed some drops for my dog. He said that if they didn't work she would have to have surgery on her eyelid. Of course the drops didn't work. \n\nI wound up taking her to Dessert Inn Animal Hospital to see Dr. Dennis Arn. He is a Bulldog specialist. I should have gone to him to begin with, as he has helped us in the past and he is a wonderful vet. I just hate that he is so far away. Lesson learned! I don't care how far I have to drive! It is worth the drive, to see a vet and not a vet tech and not to be hustled and harassed about stuff you are not even there for!! Not to mention you get quality vet care the first time, every time! \nDr Arn was able to help my dog and guess what, she doesn't need surgery.... amazing!!"
1,"So I'm sure like most guys this is not a place you would want to spend a Friday or Saturday night at a theater..... But it was date-night with the Girl and I saw there was Hairspray showing at this theater. Once again not how i want to spend a weekend night but I know my GF and she loooooves that musical. So being the good guy I am I got tickets. \n    I was expecting to go and sleep through the show and call it a night......however once the lights went down and the show started I was blown away! The cast was awesome there were no mess ups and everyone was on key. I really enjoyed myself, everyone was enthusiastic and professional the guy playing the mother was fantastic and it was all around a great time. I am for sure going to make this a date-night staple from now on..... Hope they bring the Producers soon."
0,"I have been to this bar several times in the past.  However, I went just a couple weeks ago and was NOT happy.  The happy hour selections are long gone.  They also failed to inform me that their Mercenary IPA was $6.50 a glass!!!  Obviously, they are in the full upsale business.  I would expect that in Vegas but not a dumpy bar in central Phoenix.  Needless to say...I won't be back again.  Also, the bartender had her toddler coming up to the bar as well which was inappropriate for the setting. No longer impressed."
1,"If you want to get your 'swank' on, this place is for you.  It's a fun spot to meet friends for a drink and appetizers.  I love the tapas plate which has olives, fruit, cheese, pita bread, etc.  It's delicious and well priced."
0,Nothing great about the food. Too oily. Decor is nice though.
0,New to the area and have used the car wash 3 times. Unfortunately each experience has gotten progressively worse; wait times are quoted then doubled. The staff though friendly are generally nonattentive to detail and unwilling to correct problems. This is close to my home but I will be seeking another car wash for the future.
0,"Where do I start?  If you know anything about music and what a DJ should actually sound like, stay far far away.\n\nI went here to see Craze and never thought I could be so disappointed.  The opening DJ was painful to listen to.  Even with a serato, he couldn't beat match to save his life.  He also couldn't get his levels right, come up with a decent track selection, or scratch (um, you're opening for Craze... stop embarrassing yourself).  The crowd still ate it up.  I'm not normally very judgmental, but this crowd was the lowest of the low and not what you would expect in a Vegas club.  The go-go dancers were ok with the exception of one - she had no clue what she was doing.  The dancers are supposed to set the tone for the crowd, so I guess she fit in perfectly.  When Craze went on, he totally played for this crappy crowd.  I had to book it out of there.  It was a very disheartening experience.\n\nI wish I could give this place zero stars.  The staff was nice, so I guess that's how they earned their star."
0,"Surprised I've not written something about this pub before as I've been in it quite a bit over the last year and it has a good number of ale taps. Whilst two of their current guest ales looked enticing this weekend soft drinks were, at the time of patronage, the order of the day and as they (a can of Irn Bru and Diet Pepsi from the gun) came in at \u00a34.20 there is room for improvement in that area I feel."
1,Got a cough or a cold. Sniffles taking the best of you. This CVS location is more than your typical drug store. A drive thru pharmacy is located in the back. Along with a healthcare clinic to help you when in need. Stressful day at the job or need some pick me up there is a small liquor isle. Don't forget to pull out your CVS card to save more.
1,"J'ai d\u00e9jeun\u00e9 l\u00e0 dimanche matin et je suis d'avis que Dukin' Donuts est VRAIMENT meilleur que Tim Hortons.

1,"Awesome Pho, Egg rolls & service'"
1,"So I have been hearing all about Sushi Roku for months. Everyone was saying how amazing the food was and how they loved the d\u00e9cor but they also said it was pretty pricey. So I thought I would check it out myself. What I didn't know until I got there was they have a few different menus. We ended up sitting in the Lounge and everything on the menu was $5. We had the popcorn shrimp tempura, edamame hummus (it was incredible), tuna tataki, spicy tuna roll, and several drinks. It was totally affordable!\n\nThey also told us about this Stimulus Menu. It's like $30 a person and you get your choice of appetizer, entr\u00e9e and dessert. Which I think is a great deal. You would spend wayyyy more than that on a regular dinner. So next time we go I'm trying that for sure!"
0,"what a terrible place, and it is a shame because trapeze is so much fun but gets ruined by the douchebagery of the owner."
0,"I felt the entire experience was deceptive, misleading and manipulative of people in a compromised position. The show up 1 hour late..  They are scammer I end up paying 180$ after all the fees. They told me 19$ service fee and another 23$ to get open and end up paying 180$!!!! This is a scam.. Don't be a victim....."
0,"I agree with you Peter D...that Cold Stone on 24th & Baseline is the nastiest place I've ever been to. The service is poor & the manager is cheap with his ice cream servings. He only puts the ice cream half way full & charges you for every little topping! I have never been to a store where they nickel & dime u too death. I would never go back to that Cold Stone again!!!\n\nOne last comment as I was walking out the store, the bottom of my shoes were sticking to the floor. The floor was just filthy!!! Disgusting"
0,"Been ordering from this Ray Road Pizza Hut for 6 years,  usually $50-$70 per order for parties at our house.  Now, this franchise has started charging for red peppers and cheese packets.  Terrible decision.  After complaining to the manager and driver, found out it is the owner of this and 5 other Pizza Huts around Tempe/Chandler that has added this extra fee.  We now order from a distant pizza hut under different ownership and pay the driver a nice tip to avoid this Ray Road business.  What's next, a fee for the box?"
0,"A good value, especially for its location.  My main complaint is the casino.  They only had two or three blackjack tables going, and one of them was a dreaded 6:5 table.   I ended up doing all my gambling nextdoor at the Tropicana or MGM.\nWith dealers making minimum wage, there's no reason why Hooters can't have at least 7 tables going all the time.\nAlso, I found most of the female staff to be obnoxious and unfriendly.  I understand they get tired of having guys hit on them all day, but they can't let that attitude show."
0,"I hate to give a 1 star but I had to. I'm Filipino and was really looking forward to trying this place out and was even rooting for their success but all they left me with is a bad 1st impression and an empty belly. I got there at 5:00 and they closed that day at 7:00, I tried ordering 3 different things and they were out of everything. Then the lady tried pawning off their BBQ for chicken adobo like as if I didn't know the difference. I guess they wanted me to pick from the 3 selections they had under the hot lamp that looked as if it had been there since noon. Ended up driving 30 min to Glendale and went to \""halo-halo\"" which was pretty good! I will not be returning to manilla sunrise and will make the extra trip farther to halo halo. Consider yourself warned and you can't believe everything you read in the new times."
1,"Lets just get to the bummer .. no frig in the room. \nWe got a coupon book and used it!   free bowling, bottle wine, deserts, gift at gift shop When we got to the hotel my husband was a little upset with me because it was away from the strip.  But this place has everything.. bowling alley, equestrian rink, movie theater, sushi bar, oyster bar, Mexican, steak, Italian, show, 24 hour restaurant , heated pool, hot tub, coffee in room and hair, lotion supplies.  We stayed for a week and enjoyed all of the amenities.  oh and an arcade.  I read other reviews and it said lots of locals go here.  well you know hubby that wanted to be in the middle of the strip when we went and all the crazy tourist acting crazy and drunk he said lets just go back to our hotel they have everything.  Everyone was nice and I would write our housekeeping what I needed and it was their everytime!   Just ask if you need something I needed a blanket and extra pillow no questions it was their!   Now the buffet for dinner was ok.  Its affordable and if you stay their they have a 50% off cpn dang who can have all you can eat prime rib for 8 bucks.  And its close to the airport and outlet mall and other dining facilities but we just used our coupons."
1,"We had a free afternoon and decided to spend it searching out new haunts in old town Scottsdale that we'd never been to before.  After reading a recent blog from Susie Timm and how impressed she was with Old Town Whiskey, we decided to give it a try.\n\nWe arrived around noon and had the place to ourselves, which in turn gave us the opportunity to soak in the new decor and renovation that was recently done with the renaming of this boutique hotel now known as 'The Saguaro'.  (It's only been open for 5 weeks).\n\nBeing the only customers in the place it also gave us ample time to become familiar with the bar and wait staff - including bar manager Eric who was exceptional!  What a nice guy and a fun person to get to know.  Once again confirms my belief - you can spend millions on brick and morter, but it is people that really make your business and create memories, and that is exactly what he and the rest of the staff did that day!\n\nWe tried some great new wines we'd not had before and he suggested the Pickled Red & Yellow Beets served with black olive tapenade, whipped ricotta and toasted sour dough baguettes as an appetizer.  It was delicious!\n\nWe will go back again for lunch and hope to also try their other new restaurant, Distrito ... In the meantime, we wish them all the very best with their new venture!"
1,Magnifico!  Great little place tucked away in a semi-residential area of town.  Felt like I was part of the family after being seated.  Bright cheerful atmosphere like a fiesta!  Food was very flavoful even the white rice.  Crab enchiladas full of white crab meat and smothered in your choice of red or green sauce.  Salsa you get red (Spicy) and green (mild) with chips and I got a complimentary Cerviche.  The red salsa had a nice smoky flavor and just the right kick of heat.  Can't wait to try other dishes when I return to Phoenix in a couple of weeks!
1,"I took my nieces in for a sweet treat and they loved it! The place is truly charming and clean. The pastries and our coffee were delicious. The staff was very attentive and patient. We were surprised, by the owner I believe, with complimentary samples of the gelato and it was truly amazing! Nice touch and very thankful for the sweet treat. Looking forward to going again!"
1,"Excellent choice for a chill dinner in the Venetian. Order anything with the Borelaise sauce: poutine, short ribs, etc. I have a special place in my heart for the Almost a Perfect Crime, too."
1,"I found this restaurant nestled in the back corner of the Fresh and Easy anchored strip mall on the southwest corner of Olive and 59th Ave. I stopped by for lunch last week and was extremely pleased with everything. The staff was very nice, pleasant to deal with, and fast. I ordered the gyros combo and a side of the lentil soup. The gyros is currently the best I've had in the valley. Everyone must try the lentil soup, it is by the far the best I've EVER had. I will definitely be visiting this restaurant multiple times a month!"
0,"Got Bugs? No? Want Bugs? Yes? I have your place -- apparently. \n\nFirst, nice open space, modern but comfortable with a nice atmosphere that isn't too loud or too quiet. \n\nMost importantly, I don't eat bugs voluntarily. I know, call me odd, but it just isn't my thing. Up until my visit to The Parlor, not one single person had made me feel odd or unwarranted in my preference to avoid consuming bugs...ahhh, but all good things must come to an end, even our hopes and dreams of acceptance. \n\nSo, let's stick with the facts: The Smokey (a pizza) and another pizza we ordered were delivered to our table. I quickly noticed something moving on the arugula on top of the Smokey. I attempted to wave it away, thinking it was a fruit fly. My menacing wave had no impact and then I noticed that in fact there were at least 3 or more bugs moving about the arugula. With furious vengeance, I waved at them again. Nothing. OK, not eating this pizza. \n\nSo, I called the waiter over and told him that there were bugs on the pizza. Now this is where our story takes an odd turn (really, we probably have all found a bug in our food at some point, so that's not very odd). \n\nThe waiter responded -- \""well, that's what happens when you don't use pesticides and the food is organic.\"" He then called over another waiter and told her that there were bugs on our pizza. She inspected and concluded that it was so, whereupon she asked: \""would you like something different?\"" \n\nOK. Part of me was expecting the camera crew to emerge, but alas, Candid Camera has long since gone away and instead we were having a great moment in Phoenix restaurant service history. \n\nReally, \""do we want something different?\"" No no, now that we know that the bugs are organic, we will eat that pizza, and heck, order us another with extra bugs. \n\nAnd come on...\""it's organic\""...that's your response? -- I have organic vegetables delivered to me twice a month and I have never had any bugs (granted I do wash my produce). Also, my parents had a large garden when I was younger, no pesticides, and often there were bugs on the vegetables. But, and apparently this is a strange concept, we WASHED them off before eating or serving or storing. \n\nI understand, bugs happen. What I don't understand is the response we received. We truly felt like we were being odd for sending back the pizza. I know that the service level in Phoenix often hovers around a 3 to 4 out of 10, but really, this was a new low. I wasn't expecting the owner to come on out on his or her knees, but I did expect something along the lines of: Oh, I'm very sorry, let me take that away and get you a menu so you can select something else. \n\nSure, eventually there was a rather late \""sorry\"" and an offer of a free dessert, but it was a little late for that. \n\nOn the upside it made for great humor. When the waiter asked us if we had been there before I was half expecting, if we had both said no, she would have said, well that pizza always has bugs on it. And when she asked if we needed help picking something out, I really wanted to say: yes, something without bugs. Unfortunately, I kept the joke to myself. \n\nThe pizza we did eat was OK. The crust lacked flavor and overall it wasn't on par with the likes of Cibo, Humble Pie, or Bianco.\n\nI could get over the bugs, but I have a very hard time swallowing such terrible service. \n\n...wait, maybe there is a camera on me right now as I write this and Candid Camera really has come back...that's the best explanation I have."
1,"Real fast auto glass was absolutely wonderful. I called them, frustrated with safelite's service and the owner joe himself came to my rescue. I live in Vegas and was in mesa visiting family. I can't wait until you have a branch in las vegas! Such an honest family company. Just a 26 year old working hard to expand but maintain outstanding customer service. Thanks so much joe, not only were you speedy, but genuine, knowledgable, and personable. I absolutely recommend this company to anyone whether it be a chip in the window ( such as mine) or a full blown replacement, I wouldn't trust anyone else with my car's glass in the grueling desert heat!"
1,"I enjoy shopping for groceries in this market, although the frequency with which I shop here would be greater if this place weren't so far from where I live. The market offers a great selection of Asian fresh produce and seafood, packaged and frozen goods, and even kitchenware and gift items. It also stocks a variety of other international foods, though not as much as the Asian merchandise. This particular market is cleaner than most of the Asian markets in the Valley, cleaner than even the other Lee Lee in Chandler."
1,I freaking love this place! Their Arizona Burrito with chicken is amazing! My favorite little hole in the wall Mexican restaurant!
0,"We were seated fairly quickly, and received drinks shortly after. But then it took almost an hour to receive the food. It was not that busy in there when we first got there, but within 30 minutes the place was packed with people waiting to be seated. Overall the service could have been better but was not the worst experience."
1,"I was overall pretty impressed by this hotel.  It's very chic and modern, perhaps a little too cold and uninviting, but nice.  The rooms were awesome!  Nice bed, wonderful view(one whole wall was basically a big window), bathroom was very nice.  You could open and close the curtains eith your tv and set your alarm that way as well as turn on/off all the lights.  Here are some downfalls: no cheap eats anywhere in it, check in/out took quite a bit of time, maid service did not come everyday.  We got a good rate on rooms so it was well worth it."
0,"It's pretty pricey for things you'd think would be pretty cheap. I went there looking for birthday presents for a friend, and they didn't have what I needed, and the cashier got kinda pushy about me buying something else... I just wanted to leave. Was uncomfortable. I won't be back."
0,Worst urgent care I have ever visited.  Doctor didn't even touch me when I went in for severe back pain.  Just prescribed me pain pills even after telling her my history of spinal surgery.  And she told me to do stretches.  \n\nThen they took my credit card and gave me someone else's receipt!  Then I get a bill in the mail for $50.  I pay it through my bill pay and I get an email from them saying they charged my credit card $50.  I wrote back twice trying to get a refund for one of the extra $50 charged.  No response.  Called them and the chick on the phone says I need a check number.  I explained I paid it through bill pay so there is no check number.  She had no record of me paying twice.  How convenient!  Then I ask for a supervisor and of course he was unavailable.  He was supposed to call me but never did.  So I disputed the charge through my bank and at least I get one of my $50 back.  \n\nI do NOT recommend ever visiting this establishment.  There are plenty other urgent care facilities.  Save the aggravation and steer clear of this place.
1,"Great wine and great customer service!\nWe were in Scottsdale for my friend's bachelorette party, and we did the \""bottling party\"" at Su Vino.  We had a big table that sat all 8 of us, with cheese, fruit and crackers, and our own personal wine maker bringing us tastes and explaining the different wines.  Then we were able to bottle our own wine, and put our own label on it (we had a picture of all of us girls).\nIt was a blast!  I would definitely recommend a visit here!"
1,"Another awesome night here! Where else can you go to a fun haunted house in February! Great staff, excellent sets, enthusiastic performers, and it ends in a bar with an awesome view of the strip! What more can you ask for?"
1,"Black jeans, grey shirt, black tie and black Chucks. Sounds like something out of every hip GQ man's closet, my closet. As cool as I dress, sorry to disappoint, that is your waiter's wardrobe my friend. \n\nSuper sexy and super loud. Decor is modern and cool as heck with their M16 lamps. Yep, you heard me, M16s! I couldn't read the chalk, but rumor is someone wrote the Art of War up there. I guess the M16's make sense now!\n\nFood is A-okay, a lil' pricey though. My only gripe is about the bartender (see ART of Yelp), as I have not forgotten."
1,Its great food
1,"We were only outside at the pools here for the Epicurean Affair in May. Highly anticipated event, I encourage all to go next year.  \n\nAll the pool areas were lovely and arranged really nicely. The food event was the bomb and was done very well. \n\nFood was incredible!"
1,"This is a Charlotte treasure. Incredible menu, that can be a little overwhelming, but take your server's suggestions. Everything I've had here is delicious. They make same-day reservations only, so be sure to call ahead. Otherwise, you will be waiting..."
1,"Luv luv luv Desert Roots! The owner Lesley is truly and entrepreneur and is going places. It's tough to find delectible vegan food that you crave! My recommendation is to sample it all because there are just too many choices from mild to spicy. The atmosphere is always upbeat. Be patient if newbies are in line, remember...you were once one too!"
1,I'm still amazed and impressed with how the water show is choreographed to music each of the handful of times I've seen it.
1,THIS is how thin crust pizza should be done! Period! Everyone take lessons from this place!  Stopped by during our last visit to Sin City and were pleasantly surprised.  The kids' godfather (how appropriate! - & he's Italian too!) recommended it.  The cheese was thin but tasted thick. Crust incredibly thin but filling. Cooked just right.  There's one in El Segundo we'll drive out to one of these days.
1,"My favorite bar in Tempe.  Chill patio scene.  Grab a pint and a table outdoors.  Due to its proximity to ASU it tends to attract a college crowd but there is a good mix of ages most of the time.  You can wear your grungies and not feel out of place, which is always a plus.  If you like uppity Scottsdale bars you might consider this a \""dive\"" even though it's not."
1,"I tried this place for the first time today and I will definitely go back. The location is very convenient for me, it's a good value, and they started working on him as soon as I handed over the leash. For $25 (my dog is only 15 pounds so it may be more for larger dogs) they gave him a bath and brush, nail trim, and expressed his anal glands. The fact that the glands are a standard part of the service is what sold me. It's what I needed for my dog the most and I have never had to take him before so I was happy to see that it would be no extra cost and no extra hassle for them. I like that they don't put the dogs in cages so my dog got to play with the other dogs there until I came to get him. I'm happy I found this place and will recommend it to others."
1,Service and food was impeccable. I'm very impressed to say the least. I'll be coming back and Bringing my friends. From the paella to the flan it was amazing. Every bite I tasted was on point. I'm very impressed.
1,"Alan and I walked down here for dinner.  Several of the other restaurants we were interested in were closed tonight.  Steak Fr\u00eetes is a small chain, about 16 restaurants mostly in Eastern Canada.  They have no liquor license apparently because patrons are encouraged to bring their own wine and there were many bottles of wine in evidence.  We drank water.\n\nThe restaurant is housed in a large room w/ high ceilings.  The wall on one side was red brick.  It's divided up into smaller spaces via a few very attractive room dividers made of wrought iron and plexiglass.  Light fixtures are suspended from metal racks which are in turn suspended from the ceiling.  We were greeted and seated at a table for two by one of the room dividers.  Chalkboard menus written in French are strategically posted around the room so they can be read from any vantage point.\n\nAs is usual in Montreal we were addressed in French by our server, Marc, who switched to English when we indicated that was the language we spoke.  He brought us menus in English.  We were interested in calamari as a starter, but wanted to know if there were tentacles.  There ensued a charades-like communication, which culminated in Marc wiggling his fingers to indicate that there were tentacles.  He was adorable.  In addition to the calamari we each ordered steak fr\u00eetes, which came w/ salad, sauteed vegetables and endless fr\u00eetes.  We also ordered a side of sauteed mushrooms.\n\nWe were brought a basket containing two very hot rolls w/ butter.  The rolls were very good.  The calamari arrived and it was among the best we've had.  The batter was crisp and flavorful and the calamari was meltingly tender.  The salads were simple, w/ butter lettuce, slices of red onion and dressing.  We were offered more rolls but declined.  The steaks arrived, both medium rare, mine more toward rare while Alan's was more toward medium.  The accompanying vegetables were tiny haricot verts w/ a couple of pear tomatoes.  The steaks were very tasty.  At Marc's suggestion we had a little sauce on the side, but the meat was so good the sauce was unnecessary.  The vegetables were very good.  The mushrooms were a pleasure  The fr\u00eetes were disappointing, lukewarm and not particularly interesting.  I was happy to skip them but Alan wanted them hot, so he asked for more that were fresher.  The fr\u00eetes server came around w/ his bowl and gave me more then started to walk away.  Alan called him back, indicating he wanted some too.  They were better than the first batch, but still not that good.  The rest of the meal overshadowed the disappointing fr\u00eetes and we were pleased."
1,"Popped into the bookstore for a bit to make some time pass while my wife was nearby in an appointment. Surprise, there's a small coffee shop here in a space that could well be a closet.\n\nBut the coffee was better than the stuff they sling at *$ and it wasn't any more expensive."
1,"Had the jade red chicken and emerald chicken in a quesadilla with beans and rice.  Tasty and very filling. They are generous with portions. A very filling meal w/drink for under $10. \n\nThe food did not blow me away, but its good and the service is very friendly and efficient. As soon as I walked in, the guy at the counter asked if it was my first time and since it was, he offered me samples of everything on the menu and walked me through recommendations and how to order. \n\n4 stars for the great service and unique take on Chinese/Jamaican/Mexican fusion."
1,"Excellent experience here!\n\nI highly recommend the shrimp enchilladas in green sauce as well as the carne asada tacos.\n\nSit outside and enjoy the weather, live music and great atmosphere. The drinks are STRONG so be advised. \n\nYes, it's expensive, know that before you go."
0,"I used to really like this place, I haven't been in years but on my last visit it seems things have gone downhill. Beano's is a small bar/grill/casino. I used to come here when I was younger, as in under 21, and they used to have a dining room for families. I am not sure if the dining room is still open, but the doors were closed so we had to eat in the bar area. Now I don't like to eat where there is smoke, but it didn't seem too bad so we stayed. I ordered the Reuben sandwich which comes with 1 side. Your options are fries, mashed potatoes, onion rings, salad or veggies. I chose the beer battered fries. Boyfriend got the steak which came with 2 sides, he chose onion rings and mashed. The food came out quickly, but it was nothing to write home about. The Reuben was a just a sandwich that lacked flavor and it was pretty dry. I would order an extra side of thousand island nxt time. My bf's steak was not medium as he ordered, it was gray and tough. The onion rings were pretty good, but not good enough to make me come back."
1,"Though the name of the store has changed over the years, this brick and mortar has been around since I was a kid.  My grandparents have always referred to it as the \""ghetto market\"".  LOL  What can I say, some may feel that the neighborhood is a \""ghetto\"".  But cest la vie, it's the neighborhood I grew up in and went to grade school right around the corner.  You want a huge store with shiny new lights and fixtures, there's Fry's right down the street.   \n\nAnyhow, you simply can NOT beat their produce prices.  In fact, if I simply need veg for a dinner, I'll drive here than go to Fry's because Food City produce beat Frys.\nExample - \nFood City Bananas - 3lbs for 99cents.  \nFry's Bananas - 1lb for 57 cents.\nBuying Food City Bananas - 42% savings \n\nPretty sweet!  :)"
1,This is a very unique bakery. A couple of times now I've received cupcakes as gifts of congratulations or thank you. I think they make a great gift especially if you don't know what to get someone! Everyone loves cupcakes! The baked goods are not what you may be used to. They are not going to taste sweet and processed with a lot of sugar. The ingredients taste fresh. I love the coconut! Mmmm! They also offer breakfast and lunch! A little hard to find and to park but worth it. Something different and fresh and delicious!
0,I went to this nail salon upon seeing all the positive reviews on Yelp.  I was NOT happy.  The people there are RUDE.  I know many nail salons do not have the best customer service but this was one of the worse.  The woman who did my nails (I had a full set done for a wedding) insisted on what SHE thought was best and ignored what I wanted.  My nails came out fine but the entire experience pissed me off.
1,"Portions: Huge\nService: Top Notch\nAtmosphere: Awesome for loud groups and families\n\nThis place is a great basic restaurant for groups and families. It lies in the old Vine/McKenna's Tavern location, and while the decor isn't anything fancy, the service was fabulous and the food was really good and large portions. \n\nSo some of their TVs are old school, who cares. They have great drink prices and daily specials as well as plenty of flat screens. They were really good accommodating all my food allergies and they serve cider, so I'm a happy camper. \n\nAnd, I love the fact that I can toss my peanuts on the floor and make a major mess with my 2 year old without anyone giving me the stink eye."
1,"So I'm walking through my living room and glance down the hall.  I see a huge puddle on the carpet coming from the laundry room!  I open the door and the entire room is filled with water!  \n\nWell, long story short, I called Fred And Farhaad and they were at my house within an hour!! Are you kidding me!! Unbelievable service!  They had to suck what water they could get out, out.  Then open carpet at the seem, remove the wet padding, let the carpet dry with fans for 3 days, then come and put new padding down and repair seem.  \n\nNow it's like nothing happened and they were reasonably price to boot!  Just call them, you will not be disappointed!"
1,"I guess the reviews on here are somewhat mixed, but I love this restaurant.  Their ravioli is delicious.  Although, now that I think about it, I'd probably eat ravioli off the floor of a prison."
1,I went with my girlfriend for lunch.   She ordered the guacamole burger which I tried some of.   It was one the best burgers that I've had In a while.   I ordered the cajun chicken pasta.   I've had this several times and it's one my favorite dishes.   Add on a fat tire draft beer and you are all set.   \n\nGood food and good service we will definitely be back.
0,"The WORST service I have ever had in a restaurant in Las Vegas. Two stars only because the food was very good. Otherwise I would give one star. It has the prices (and food) that go along with a fine dining establishment, but the service was so awful that all of the effort that goes into such is totally wasted. Maybe because I'm not a playboy bunny?  I noticed that the table adjacent to ours was fawned over by the same waiter. That table happened to have a very beautiful woman who apeared to be a model (a real one) seated at it. So here's the low-down:  we waited for about 15 minutes before our waiter materialized to take our drink and dinner order at the same time.  When I ordered my steak, I told him to bring us an order of each of the four steak sauces that I knew we would both enjoy. He looked at me as if I were insane, which prompted me to inquire if the sauces were extremely large servings. He told me I should maybe scale it back to one or two sauces, because they were 4$ each. Hmmm. So I'm spending hundreds of dollars on dinner and he thinks that a few $4 sauces are going to break my bank?  So I scaled back to only one sauce.  It was a pretty good peppercorn sauce, which I would have enjoyed more of, but the waiter disappeared when our food was delivered and we never saw him again.  Actually we saw him, but he was too busy fawning over the other nearby table to notice that we might like some more bread (completely gone), another drink (the sangria was very good), or anything else for that matter.  \nOnce again, very good food but absolutely the WORST SERVICE I have ever received anywhere in Las Vegas.  And I have been to quite a few restaurants there.  I will not be going back.  There are way too many excellent steakhouses in LV to suffer through this kind of lack of service."
0,"This place sucked.\nThe chef was standing around in the middle of the dining room coughing into his hands, scratching his nose and wearing a dirty apron. Gross. All this while watching his wait staff run arounds without a thought of running some food or helping them get out of the weeds. He was just texting on his phone or drinking a beer at the bar. Really unprofessional and disrespectful towards his staff.\n\nNow for the ambiance- the place was cute but for some reason the lights were placed behind the fans making a strobe light effect on all the tables. If this doesn't give you an epileptic seizure it will definitely give you a minor headache.\n\nAll this could have been overlooked if the food was good. But it wasn't. Quite the opposite actually. The bread sent to the table was stale and frankly would not have been good even if it was fresh. $40 for some dinky frozen shrimp with soggy breadcrumbs and an undressed salad with dry chicken was unimpressive.\n\nI've been in the business a long time, we go out to eat very often and I am definitely never coming back here again."
0,"Let me tell you a story about a casino being rebuilt and re-branded. They closed down, let everyone know that they were coming back better than ever next year, and took their lumps knowing that the reward would be worth the effort.\n\nThat place...is Bill's Gambling Saloon. It's not the Quad.\n\nThe Quad, on the other hand, went another route: rename the venue, slowly renovate the casino portion of the building, and then sit on their asses while the rest of the building falls apart.\n\nMy friends and I stayed at the Quad last week as we were looking for a cheap place to stay while on our Vegas trip. We stayed for five nights which is why we skimped on accommodations. I don't know how the new owners get away with calling this place anything except the Imperial Palace; the rooms are the same, the carpets are the same, the decor is the same...seriously, the only thing that makes it worth even entertaining the notion of staying is Hash House a-Go Go.  That restaurant is the only clean part of the whole hotel. \n\nIf the new ownership group had anyone with a brain left in that place they'd shut it down, do a real and full remodel, and open when the smell of cigarettes and urinal cakes finally dissipates. Seriously, the hotel is falling apart.\n\nI was weary of staying there but the price swayed me. I wish it hadn't. For the love of all that is both holy and unholy in this world, DON'T STAY HERE. Wait until the renovations are done, wait for people to review the renovations...and then wait until the gleam wears off to see if it's still worth it. You can go cheap almost anywhere on the strip at this point; the Flamingo is cheap and pretty and right next door.\n\nPlus, what asshole approved 6-to-5 payouts for Blackjack? Idiot."
0,"I can see that there are two other reviews here, another from a big PJ fan, Brian.  Similar experience.  We ordered some staples that we normally get at other PJ locations.  Got the Humus with Grilled Chicken.  Chicken was dry, reddish (too much paprika?) and no flavor.  Not the juicy grilled-to-perfection chicken that we're used to getting at the other locations.  Tabuli salad did not have enough dressing and was sandy - they didn't soak the wheat enough?, and the the rice was undercooked in the grape leaves wraps.  \n\nNot to mention, the tables are flimsy and cheap looking, wobble, and just an overall horrible experience.  We paid, and before walking out, decided to share this feedback directly with the manager.  She mentioned that they were still trying to work out kinks, and mentioned that she went through the stuffed grape leaves we returned with the chef and agreed that it was undercooked -- which didn't stop her from serving it to others right as she was talking to us!  \n\nWe also waited ~ 40 minutes for our food.  Was barely warm, and we had our 2 year old daughter who loved mac and cheese, but this one came cold and clunky, so she said \""I don't like this mac and cheese!\"".\n\nVery disappointing.  It is worth to drive the extra few miles to the Shea location."
0,"LAX LAX LAX...where do I start? I heard it was one of the top clubs in Vegas so I thought I'd check it out. I had my doubts while waiting in line when I saw the clientele...to put it bluntly, I thought they were on the trashy side. The club is dark, music is ok, it gets crazy crowded to the point where you can't move or do anything. Takes minimum 30 minutes to get a drink. I honestly can't think of one good thing to say about this club. Me and my friends left in less than an hour.\n\nI think I figured the club out:\nThey sure do a good job marketing...hiring celebrities to hype it up, get their name in the media by hiring celebrities. Fools like me see celebrities in the club from magazines or TV and think it must be alright. \nI also noticed half the club space is reserved for private tables - a very smart move because that's their main money maker.\n\nIf you are thinking about clubbing in Vegas, skip this one and go somewhere else - lots of better clubs in Vegas, e.g. PURE."
1,Elvis renewed our vows and it was amazing!  Elvis was fabulous.  highly recommend it - what a great experience. very professional.
0,"On Friday, April 16, 2010 The management at this Arena allowed a drunk misogynist with really bad hair to abuse and assault me, refusing to remove the person even when I went to the trouble of hunting down the manager/team leader. \n\nThe blond hefty usher who clearly didn't want to be bothered to do her job,  told me that they had no authority to remove the patron who screamed \""faxxot\"" at myself and my brother for an entire period of hockey, and then called me a C_NT, and shoved me as I left the stadium.  I had earlier complained to the management that this person refused to stay seated and they said they had no authority to remove him. \n\nNo wonder they are going bankrupt."
1,"Thanks to Goldstar my wife and I were treated to wonderful evening in a fabulous little theatre where we enjoyed \""Annie Get Your Gun.\"" The Don Bluth Front Row Theatre located at 8670 Shea in Scottsdale is a treasure where you sit on cushioned chairs with plenty of leg room (I'm 6'4\"").  During intermission this fellow walked around with a tray of mints offering them to any and all.  As it turned out, that man was Don Bluth, theatre owner and long time animation director who's worked on many of the most important features Hollywood has offered up.  He's worked at Disney Studios and collaborated with Steven Spielberg among others.  \nDon't miss the artwork he has on display in the lobby.  All in all the play was great, Mr.Bluth was a delight and we could not have spent a more enjoyable evening.\nPeter and Diana Scott\nScottsdale"
0,"Sorry Gertrude's... seems they have a new chef and menu. The menu is not as unique as the old one. What happened to the \""Hot Mess\""? We went for lunch, the hostess seated us and said who would be taking care of us. Then a young lady brought menus and asked what we would like to drink so I ordered a glass of wine. Then another person came with my wine and took our menus. That was it. Nobody asked us what we wanted to order until I waved for some help and asked if someone could take our order. Now, they were not busy at all. Oh well, just a miscommunication I guess.\nI had the tuna sandwich and the fries were good. The sandwich was not up to my expectations.\nSomething needs to change before I return. Too bad, I used to really like Gertrude's."
1,"great food, too bad it was so expensive -_- $40 dollars???? But again, the food was great. I loved their corn chowder, their selection of desserts are wonderful.... mmm chocolate covered strawberries and apricot mousse. **side note their chocolate covered strawberries go fast, so u kind of have to hover until they refill haha but they use GOOD CHOCOLATE... We went to eat at 4pm which was just in time, we waited in line for only 15-20 min RIGHT before the dinner line, after we finished the line was insane, it wrapped around and out along the casino.... so glad we went early"
0,"As you know,  i'm spoiled by living in the Bay Area and Tokyo.\nI've had amazing food and its not always expensive, usually not.\nI just expect quality and care in any dish.\n\nI was craving Thai food and went to Thai Rama  on a recommendation based on dinner my sister had there 3 years ago.\nI always order Thai Beef Salad at a new Thai spot...sort of a litmus test.\nIt wasn't my favorite. \n\nLoads of onions, no tomato and no cucumber and no mint.\nThe spice level was nice, good flavor.\nThe beef was way over cooked and far from the medium rare juicy I expect.\n\nI'm not sure I will be back"
0,"Waited over 30 minutes because they kept on taking their friends that walked in after us, finally walked out. This has happened several times. We no longer go there."
0,"We stopped in here last night for dinner before First Friday. The place was pretty busy, and we were told we'd have a a 30 minute wait. However, it was closer to 45 minutes.\n\nThere's a big couch in the waiting area decorated with sombreros. The wall was covered with pictures of Frida Kahlo. I liked the look of the place and was looking forward to a good dinner.\n\nI ordered a chile relleno and tamal with pork in red sauce. My wife got a carne asada taco, chile relleno, and tamal with chicken in green sauce.\n\nWhile we were waiting for our food, we were given chips, salsa, and bean dip. The salsa wasn't very flavorful and the bean dip was lukewarm. \n\nIt took a very long time before we got our order. Once we got it, the food was lukewarm. The chile relleno was fine but nothing special. The tamales were okay, but again, nothing special.\n\nThe only thing I really liked was the carne asada taco. My wife got an order of flan. She's a flan snob and said it was one of the better flan she's had, second only to her favorite at Frank and Fina's Cocina.\n\nWhile we were waiting to be seated, I saw that there was Groupon available for Casa Don Juan. I bought it hoping it would be available to use by the time we were done eating. It wasn't, so I guess I'll be back. I'm hopeful that we'll have a better experience if we go when it's not so busy....I'll let you know!"
0,"My girlfriend was in from out of town and we wanted a good, romantic dinner.  I just moved to Scottsdale for business and being from Chicago, I wanted a good spot.  House of Tricks was marginal at best.  First of all, everyone claims good ambiance.  Not what its hyped up to be.  We were sat in this very small dining room immediatly when you walk in.  The worst part was that there was no music or background noise at all.  We felt like we were in a library.  With only 2 other tables, it was very awkward all night.  I'm not saying we were looking for some chic modern place, but no noise, literally, was very weird.  We were turned off from the get go, but stuck it out.  The food was pretty good (scallop app was delicious), but the overall atmosphere ruined the meal.  The service, again was just ok.  Our waiter was a bit too attentive. Overall, I'd look elsewhere before going.  Not at all what it is hyped up to be, especially for a $200 meal."
0,"This review is for its bar/lounge and NOT for the actual restaurant.\n\nOver $12 for a 6 ounce glass of watered down Crown & Coke? Y'all can haul @$$!\n\nAs for the lounge itself, it costs $20 per person to enter. Unfortunately we realized that we donated to the cause as there were a lot of couples and not as lively as we had hoped. It's very dark inside. Almost all of the seats were reserved and there were no stools at the bar, so we were forced to stand the entire night. \n\nLadies get free drinks throughout the entire night while they charge an arm and a leg to us guys for our drinks so they can recoup some of their lost revenue. Is it fair? No, but I can't blame them for wanting to draw more females to their bar. Unfortunately that wasn't the case as the ratio of guys to gals stayed the same throughout the night.\n\nI've come to the conclusion that I will never have that awesome nightlife experience again like I did when I was living in Japan. The Japanese women are nicer there, not at all stuck up, and always willing to engage in polite conversation. They don't have that \""I think that I'm better than you\"" attitude and they treat you as a human being. And the parties don't end there until about 8:00 in the morning! \n\nI miss living there :("
1,"It's a tough job, pairing a big life accomplishment with a meal. But Honey knocked it out of the park with Cafe Bink last night to celebrate his sweet new gig. I should preface this by saying my favorite meal of all time was at Binkley's two years ago. The meal was something I still find myself daydreaming about. It set the bar. \nSo when he told me we were venturing back over to the land of Chef Binkley I was giddy like a school girl with a new lip gloss. \nWe arrive and the place is packed. It was pretty small but they worked the space well and offered great outdoor seating.\nThe menu was well done with cafe-inspired food with a twist. Honey was excited about the pulled-to-order mozzarella so we ordered that to start the night. A nice French bottle of vino was opened for our celebratory toast. \nOkay, the mozzarella immediately brought me back to the food we weeped over at Binkleys. It was OFF THE HOOK. Served with thin crostinis and three amazing sauces- I could have eaten dish after dish after dish of it for appetizer, entree and dessert.  \nEntrees were the steak frites, and bacon-wrapped meatloaf along with a side of brussels sprouts with more bacon. Toe-curling deeeelish. The steak frites were perfectly med-rare and the sauce was light and flavorful. The accompanying fries were exactly as you would expect. Piping hot, crispy on the outside, soft on the inside and deliciously seasoned. And what's not to love about truffle ketchup? \nThe meatloaf was everything I wanted it to be. Complex yet comforting with buttermilk mashers and charred onions. YUMMMMMM. We also loved the brussels sprouts - we make a similar dish at home and think they would have been even better with a little Sriracha, but what do we know? \nWe were full but in the company of such good food and amazing service, we opted for dessert for the first time in a long, long time. Donuts with three sauces? Um, no-brainer. Enter various sized fresh donuts with salted caramel, dark chocolate and yummy creme fraiche with vanilla bean. The night ended as perfect as it began. \nCafe Bink is absolutely at the top of the more casual upscale restaurants in the area for me and there is no doubt I'll soon return and try their lunch menu as well. It's 10:35am...I have less than an hour to wait. :)"
0,"Been here twice.  First time I sat at a table and service was good. Sushi Rolls were good. It was a Saturday night and it was kinda dead...which is odd for the great location and the great set up of the place. Went for a second time and again it was dead on a Friday night...this should have been a sign. Second time I took a date who is a cook and has written a few books.  Not a time for Jimmy's to drop the ball. We chose the bar seating this time.  Service was god awful slow and the drinks sat dry for quite a while...my date's broccoli and meat was out at least 15 minutes before my rolls. She took one bite and gave it back. It tasted like something out of Panda Express. It was taken off the bill, but we received no apology from management. I give it a star for location and ambiance and a star for good rolls."
1,great customer service and excellent selection of booze.
1,"Bowled league at South Point last summer, it was fun, near work, but far from home so we moved to Red Rock this summer.\n\nPretty good bar, but far from everything, they had a few good specials over the summer, but it was sporadic.  Snack bar is adequate, lanes are good, nice atmosphere.\n\nChances are you can run into Flava Flav bowling here, he lives in the neighborhood."
1,Fast great food. Amazing friendly staff. Delicious cookies! Will return and recommend.
0,Even though calendar show classes available they really aren't available.  Planned and outing based on the calendar and got an email 2 days before the event that the only opening would be at least 3 weeks away.   When I finally got ahold of someone that works there she said it is not her job to keep up the calendar because she is busy with other things.  Very disappointed with the customer service or lack of.  Will take my business somewhere else.
1,"They've got a great selection of cigars AND pipes.  It's hard to find a good selection of the latter this day and age.  Most shops cater to the higher margin and repeat cigar business more than the pipe business.  Many other shops seem to carry pipes as an afterthought.  That's not the case at Jon's.  Jon's is a pipe shop first and foremost, they just happen to carry cigars too.\n\nThey have a huge selection of pipes, and most are priced fairly.  They have a nice selection of bulk/house blend pipe tobaccos and a respectable offering of tinned pipe tobaccos.  Plenty of accessories to round out your shopping experience.  The store is a little small/cramped, but that's a given considering their proximity to campus.  I never felt uncomfortable in the store -- it just adds to the charm.\n\nIf you're a college kid looking for RYO tobacco and supplies, yes, Jon's stocks those items as well.  This is no head shop, so don't waste your time looking for pipes made from materials other than briar or meerschaum.\n\nI dropped a good amount of dough here considering it was my first visit.  I found a pipe I just had to have, a couple bulk blends that caught my attention, and some tins that appeared to have some age on them (a good thing).  After I left the store, I met up with the owner and other regulars at a local bar that has a covered/heated patio area and bought two more cigars at that event (it's a weekly or monthly thing they do).\n\nOverall, it's a great shop with an outstanding pipe selection, a very good pipe tobacco selection, and a good cigar selection.  If you're lucky enough to catch the owner, he's an extremely personable and nice fellow."
1,"I was in Vegas for a meeting, and noticed the Bernina sign -- just had to stop.  It is a beautiful, clean and well stocked fabric store.  So many high quality brands, I had a hard time deciding what to get.  There is a lot of inspiration in the form of quilts, handbags, and some clothing items displayed.  The staff was friendly and attentive.\nThey had some kind of class going on in a very spacious training facility.  I'd love to see a store like this in Scottsdale!"
0,"worst music, horrible strobes that cause drunk people to bounce into me every second and then the wait to LEAVE.\nWhat kind of club has a freakin wait to get out??  A bad one that's where!!\nWe waited over thirty minutes to get the fuck out of there.\nBest bet is to fake a seizure from all those freaking strobes!\nCRAPPY!!!!"
0,Okay I get it it's a place from tv.... But to be honest this place isn't that amazing. First off the lady who took my order shorted me on not one but two things! And it took her 5x's as long as any other person to pack it. They need someone too double check the orders before they send it out! I mean come on they pretty much stole 10$ from us.
0,Great place to have fun & party and get drunk... Bad place to eat!!! Food was so bland & plain.. Like some bad ass Mexican bar food!
1,4 stars b/c I wish they were AYCE\n\nOsaka's is one of the original sushi joints in Las Vegas. Their rolls are very delicious but they do get costly b/c they don't offer all you can eat. When my bf and I go here our bill is usually $100+. Osaka's is good if you don't want to be gluttonous.
1,"Now don't expect a great dining experience. Expect a great \""diner\"" breakfast at a great price. The French toast is perfect and all egg dishes are awesome. Service was friendly, but the place need some freshening up to get the last star. Again it's a diner in a strip mall and not a fine restaurant."
1,"My favorite Mexican Restaurant, hands down!! We LOVE the manager, Justin Willie! He is very friendly & helpful every single time we come in!! So happy to hear he is back at this location! I am obsessed with the mushroom tacos & white peach & hibiscus Margarita! The happy hour is just fabulous!"
1,"I love coming to Regal because I have the Regal Crown Club card. This card is free and it allows you to get points so you are able to get free things. Every 50 points you get a free soda, 100 points a small popcorn and 150 points a free movie ticket. Each point =$1. Your points add up pretty quickly because a movie costs $11 minimum if you aren't at a matin\u00e9e movie. You can also use the card at the concession stand and your points can rack up that way since nothing is cheap. \n\nThe last time I went to Regal was to see the Wizard of Oz. It was opening night so it was really crowded but Regal was organized and had a separate line for the entrance to this movie. I thought it was very organized and better than having no line at all. We got good seats. There aren't really any bad seats-I just would rather not sit in the very front since these seats are set up in the stadium seating model. The movie was packed but luckily there was no one loud or texting by my seat. \n\nOverall Regal is a great place to catch a movie. Their prices are the same as other movie theaters but the selling point to me is the Regal Crown Club card. Also if you go on Tuesdays its only $6 a movie! This is bargain because tickets are usually double the price. If you are low on cash you should see a movie on Tuesdays."
1,"Literally, this place has the best burger I've eaten in my entire life. So good I went two days in a row. I make it a point to come here every time I visit Vegas. \n\nOnly problem, which I can't dock stars for nor would I, this place is only in Vegas. Please please please open up a restaurant in LA!"
0,Nastyyy calzone!!!! Do not go there!!! I had to throw out my food!!!!
1,"My fianc\u00e9 and I dined at Mercadito not long after it's opening so I went in under the assumption that there would be some kinks that would need to be worked out, but that was definitely not the case. The staff was super friendly and our busser was very attentive. \n\nThe food was excellent (definitely try the guac with bacon... Mmmmmm bacon....). Enchiladas were hot and flavorful. Cocktails were great and the chocolate cake lava dessert? Fantastic! I'll be back!"
1,"The Marriott City Center has a great location close to everything. The rooms have been recently renovated and the restaurants and bars in the hotel do a nice job. \n\nThe rooms are \""Marriott practical\"" meaning that all the things that you need to have a successful trip whether business or pleasure are there. Nice work area with plenty of outlets, but they still charge for an Internet connection ($12.95 per day), sweet bed linens (if you like them alot, you can purchase them through a catalog in the room) and a bathroom stocked with Bath and Body works products. There is a HD flat screen TV in the room and a dock for your iPod but missing was a mini-bar which I thought was a standard in Marriott rooms. Oh well. . . . .no Pringles and beer for me! \n\nBut what pushed this to a 4 star review for me was the high level of service that I got during my stay. From the moment that I checked in I was taken care of. My room reservation and keys were ready to go when I got there. They lent me an umbrella to stave off the snowstorm that was raging outside. I was greeted at every turn by management and staff alike and room service even ran back downstairs to get me a straw when my Bloody Mary came without one. Every one was courteous and polite. \n\nIn the small points department, know before you go that the walls between the rooms in this hotel are not that thick. Trust me- I spent the night in the room next to the couple who was celebrating Valentines Day over and over and over again. Instead of \""getting a room\"", maybe they should have \""stayed at home\"". Yikes! Even the TV couldn't drown out their \""delight\"" in having a king sized bed. Let's just say it sounded like they got their money's worth. \n\nThat aside-Marriott's are a good choice for their consistency across all variables. I'll stay here again the next time I'm in the \""Queen City\""."
0,good selection but expensive. some of the employees are not particularly friendly or warm (i.e. the owner/manager). i don't particularly enjoy coming here but sometimes it's practical.
0,"Place was great the first time I went, Second time one of Dan's fair weather buddies (thinking he was big shooter) disrespected a good friend of mine over a misunderstanding that could have easily been solved through civil conversation, but he tried to be Mr. Big Shot.  \n\nThe food was good, but not good enough to put up with that crap ever again."
0,"Didn't end up eating here because the cashiers were sooooooo slow. \n\nBrother and I stood in line for 10 minutes with two other people in front of us. They had simple orders but cashiers were too busy chatting it up amongst themselves. Guys cooking burgers also looked dirty, gave my brother the 'let's leave' glance and never looked back."
1,"I had the pleasure of stopping into Rocky Mountain Chocolate Factory while on vacation in North Carolina this spring. The variety of chocolates and dipped apples was quite large for the relatively small size of the store. I purchased a couple different things and they were all extremely delicious! I really enjoyed the English Toffee.\n\nThe only negative was that the woman who helped me followed my every step and did not take her eyes off me a single time while in the store so it was hard for me to concentrate/make a decision on what I wanted to purchase. Maybe that's just a North Carolina customer service thing, I don't know."
1,"This is one of my regular spots - good, everyday sushi at a decent price. Go during happy hour, 2 to 5 for their best deal. I go at least once a week to get my sushi fix. I like making my own roll selections though I have tried the menu items. It's very nice that they don't charge extra for brown rice. It's not gourmet sushi but it is good and if you want sushi as often as I do, this is a great place to get it."
1,"We came here to celebrate a birthday. It was a cold weekday night and the restaurant was pretty empty. One thing I immediately noticed is that the inside of the restaurant is so, so much nicer than the outside. I have driven past this place a hundred times and always got the impression this place was probably dingy inside. I was very wrong. Not only was the dining room very elegant and classy, but the staff were professional too. Our server made a good recommendation for my son since there was no kid's menu. We started out with an appetizer of tempura shrimp which was excellent and tasty. I had the miso soup and it was spot on - goooood. Then we had our sushi, the philly roll, alaska roll, and illini roll. Oh heavens, it was so good. The illini roll had a kick to it, quite spicy, but I love spiciness. Until now, I thought good sushi in Champaign was wishful thinking. We ended our dining experience with a bowl of green tea ice cream, so, so wonderfully delicious."
1,They are at the Fresh 52 markets and make some amazing vegetarian food. We are addicts and need our veggie fix weekly. Besides being amazing chefs they are amazing people.  They are both into Yoga and healthy living as well as a nice dose of Physics. Anyone who knows who Brian Greene is rocks my world.  Some of the small biz in town only use Facebook so here is their page. http://www.facebook.com/vegoutlasvegas?sk=info
1,"I almost hate when service is this good because they've basically earned my business for years. The suits are excellent. I was pleasantly surprised. Definitely best place in the valley for a suit. Tons of great options. Shirts are a 4.5 out of 5. If you're a fat dude these won't work. They haven't started their bespoke suits and shirts yet but I'm looking forward to those. The ties and shoes are good but not their bread and butter. There was a tall blonde dude who was very knowledgable, personable and friendly. I've been desperately looking for a place to get suits since moving from the east coast and I've found it. I gave this place no shot to live up to the hype but it did.  If you're a guy who wants a good price for high quality slim fitting shirts and suits save yourself the aggravation and just go here. It's hidden up the escalator by Tanzy. Basically above Lululemon."
0,"Disappointing. I've been to lots of taquerias in Mexico, St. Louis and California, and this one was way below average. As much as I like authentic Mexican food, I'd prefer a big chain over this place. Not recommended."
0,I wish I can write a good review despite the fact the lady owner is nice. I agree with some of reviewers that this place is a bit pricely for breakfast. For two people my bill was twenty dollars and I just ordered  two regular breakfast entrees and coffees and I think the owner overcharged my bill. I rather have a business gains loyalty first then people will come and eat eventually. The portion of the good wasn't huge and I didn't ordered the 3.99 special. For 5.99 I expect better portion. Next time I will for to I Hop and Panera for better food and quality. Not going there again.
0,so bad ! bad service and nasty food.. sorry I have to give 1 star ..never had such a bad experience!\n\nServer was rude when we ask no ice he gave us this bad look you never forget!\n\nMy chicken inside the pho was stale! I had to take it out of the soup\n\nWE FOUND A HUGE PIECE OF PLASTIC INSIDE MY BOY FRIEND THE PHO! (I wish we took a pic of that but we didnt)\n\nin that point we paid and left.. never again
0,"BEWARE! My review is only for this lady who I had the worst haircut experience with in my entire life.  I didn't get her name but she's medium to heavy size caucasian woman and has tattoos on her body.  Her section is far left when you enter the door.\n\nAside from getting the worse haircut she was extremely unprofessional and had a negative attitude from the beginning.  She asked for every detail on how to give the haircut, every snip! It was extremely frustrating since it was her job as a stylist to understand the look and feel, not be a robot with scissors.  \n\nTo summarize, avoid at all cost. Plently of other hair cut places around - don't waste your time, money, and risk your image."
1,"I have had both a facial and Swedish massage here, both were very good and a great price from Groupon. Thanks!"
1,One of the rare customer oriented bike shops in the Phoenix area. Denis is amazing and the staff takes time to address any questions without making you feel idiotic or uncool.
0,"Sigh.  This morning I'm a sad panda.  This location is on my way to work, so occasionally I'll stop for a coffee and a maple bar.  Today, I was feeling savory - so I went with a bagel breakfast sandwich.  Do not, under any circumstances make this mistake.  It's partially my own fault.  I don't order buffalo wings at Quizno's, I don't get potstickers at In n' Out - but since I've never had a bad item at this place, I figured why not?\n\nI'll tell you why.  Bagel = dry / flavorless.  Eggs = un-seasoned.  Bacon = under-cooked and only ONE piece folded in half FOR AN ENTIRE SANDWICH?!?!  On top of that, no sauce / mayo / spread / schmear a.k.a. NOTHING to make up for the fail that was this morning's attempt at sustinence.\n\nI digress.  The maple bars are always spot on, the old fashioned cake doughnuts are money - even their coffee is consistent - so I guess what I'm saying is, don't get a sandwich at a donut shop.  The end."
1,"Love this place!  My little chi, Moe, has been going there for the past month or so and it's been wonderful.  I love that when I call to schedule him for day camp or boarding they immediately know which dog he is and express their excitement that he'll be coming.  Moe has some attachment issues and likes to be near people constantly and they're fine with that.  In fact, they even seem to love it rather than being annoyed by it.  I love that they do the initial temperament test to make sure he'll do well there and that they have webcams running 24/7 that I can view on my phone.  The fact that he can run free and play (or climb in a lap!) all day is great!  I also really like that he's with dogs of all sizes and not separated into groups based on size like so many other facilities.  The report cards that are sent promptly at the end of each day and the pics on Facebook are all extra perks offered at Villa La Paws that make the experience of trusting them with your dog even easier."
1,"I got a massage/facial package as a gift and it was absolutely the best massage I've ever gotten.  I upgraded from a Swedish to a deep tissue, which was performed by Theresa.  She focused on my problem areas, was friendly, and the best masseuse ever.  I can't emphasize how awesome she was!  I felt like a new woman after my massage.  Then I had a great facial with Tina!  Both nice ladies and made my experience at GVR Spa just spectacular!!"
0,Average everything. No special reason to return. Not a FUN bar. Gaming and a drink that's it. Stools a bit dangerous with the push pins coming out of the arm rests.
1,Great as always. I love the PSL....\n\nThis location has lots of seating inside and out. \n\nDrive thru is always super busy\n\nGreat location!\n\nOnly issue is the music is much too loud for a coffee shop. It should just be background music. Not so loud.
0,"I went there after purchasing a living social deal.  First of all, I want my nail done French and they said they couldn't do it, they didn't know how. The pedicure was disappointing.  She didn't cut my cuticles and did a  sloppy job on my toes.  The lady was nice, but talked to much. I really enjoy the massage chairs and bubbly foot soak. The chair was basic and they brought out a bowl of water for the soak. I was also supposed to get a glass of champagne, but of course they didn't have it.  I had a shellac nail treatment.  They again don't soak your hands or cut your cuticles.  She missed a large area on my thumb.  Very disappointing experience.  I will never go back.  I will stick with the asians. They do nails best."
0,From living in NYC for 27 years I tried this place and I took one bite and threw it all away. And very expensive
0,"We went to breakfast here with excitement for the bottomless mimosas. However, the \""bottomless\"" mimosas were only refilled once and that was after having to ask our waitress for another. \n\nWe were surprised to see low prices compared to virtually every other restaurant in Vegas. But, when the food came- it became clear why. The food was marginal at best."
1,"This is a nice area for shopping, eating, relaxing, or just walking for a little exercise. There's plenty of parking where the shops are. There are boutiques, banks, a grocery store, UPS Store, and a variety of eating venues. I like Von's but it is a bit more expensive than other grocery stores. The area is nicely lit and taken care of. This area is close to the library and Trails Park, making it a great neighborhood to live near."
1,"LOVE LOVE LOVE this place!  We ate here literally everyday. We would say let's eat somewhere else for brunch, but NOOOOO whenever we would walk by we would detour and walk back into the Sugar Factory.  Their food is AMAZING and priced well.  Very nice envrionment too and the staff is so nice.  Totally recommend you go to this one.  I love how it is underneath the Las Vegas Eiffel Tower...too cute."
0,"Maybe it's because I live in the excellent beer city of San Diego, but I was definitely underwhelmed by the Four Peaks brewing company. The beer isn't bad, but the food was less than desirable. The \""beer bread\"" is basically a thick flour tortilla. It is nothing special. The pasta salad looked like somebody regurgitated it into my plate. I took one (small) bite and almost vomited. Needless to say, we won't be returning here anytime soon. On a positive note: our server was excellent."
1,"These guys are awesome. I have no idea what we would have done during the monsoon season without them. Mike, our tech, is fantastic ~ always goes above and beyond in everything he does. And everyone at the company is amazing to deal with. Thank you again and again for everything you've done this summer."
1,"We went when they were offering a special Chinese New Year buffet. They had split, grilled lobster tails, rack of lamb, and some other dishes not typically offered. I'm not a lobster person, or lamb for that matter, but my BF was super stoked. The price was more expensive and they advised they only offer lobster during New Years and Chinese New Year.  The salad bar was a bit small, but offered different types of lettuces, and typical salad toppings. There was an additional smaller salad/appetizer area with shrimp caesar salad, and another as well, but I forgot what kind. This station also offered a antipasta selection of meats, cheeses, olives, peppers, etc. There was real shaved parmesan there as well. The meat station was crowded because that's where they were doing the lobster tails and everyone was hovered around trying to get one.  I had the cauliflower au gratin which was excellent! BF is not much of a vegetable eater, but he loved it so maybe this is something we can incorporate into our meals at home. Also had grilled asparagus, carved turkey w/ cranberry sauce which was actually quite dry. I think maybe they need to leave a hunk of skin over the already cut piece of turkey to keep it somewhat moist.  Fingerling roasted potatoes were good, and trying to get to the Asian foods and Pizza areas, I was distracted by the desserts, so I really didn't see too much, but I remember a small sushi area offering nigiri and rolls, typical asian inspired cuisine like chow mein, fried and steamed rice, and chicken/broccoli/seafood dishes. Now, the dessert cart..YUM!  I had a chocolate vanilla dome cake which was to die for!  It looked like cocoa powder was dusted over a dome, but it was actually cake!  A really thin layer of chocolate cake (think mocha in color), with a vanilla chocolate mousse inside that was so creamy!  I wanted like 6 of them, but they slyly put them on little square plates making it hard to actually take that many! lol   I also had a piece of tiramisu which was equally good and creamy. BFhad a piece of cheesecake which he said was great! \n\nWe'll definitely go back!"
0,"I used to be a big proponent of keeping the US Postal Service in business, but over the past year, my mind has changed completely. \n\nMost recently, I sent a package to some friends in England.  Over a month had gone by and they still hadn't received the shipment.  One day, a box showed up at our door.  It was the box that we had sent out about 5 weeks prior, except it had no contents.  The box looked as though it had been ripped open and the books that I had sent to their children were missing.\n\nThe Post Office on Russell Road could not help me at all.  They told me they didn't know what happened, and despite the message on the package saying it had made it to Los Angeles, they told me it never actually left Las Vegas (according to their report they printed over the computer).  The manager asked me to fill out a form (I would not be reimbursed for the box they made me buy to ship the books because they told me I could reuse it - despite the box being torn open).  They also told me I would not be reimbursed for the contents which was valued at $22.  I filled out the form the manager asked me to fill out and when I asked her what my case number was (one of the questions on the form) she told me she didn't know and that I'd have to do it online.  I said, \""then why did you give me a form to fill out here?\""  She just reolied again that I'd have to do it online and I may or may no hear back.  That was it.  There was nothing further they could do. \n\nUnfortunately this is not the only time I have had a package go missing when shipping through the USPS.  I have finally learned my lesson and will not be supporting them anymore.  FedEx and UPS may cost more, but at least my package won't be stolen and the customer service is much better.  It's such a shame."
0,Good drinks and drink specials. Food is rather bland and boring compared to mad mex.
0,They have the slowest drive thru service.  Don't go to this location if you're running late!
0,"I've been going to Pita Jungle since it was a twee, one-room hovel on Apache, back when we had to walk uphill in the snow with no shoes for eight miles and shit. Seriously, I'm a long-time devotee. Back when I worked at that Planned Parenthood next door, it was 1000 Beans for lunch... every day. (Many apologies to my former co-workers and patients.)\n\nSo I've watched the gradual growth of PJ with some interest. Who doesn't want to see a locally-owned business thrive? When I saw the latest installment of the Great PJ Takeover occur in the form of a food court presence at Fashion Square, however, I have to admit I was somewhat befuddled. The dirty dreadlock crowd, attempting to permeate the premium-gas-only-SUV Louis Vuitton crowd? Doesn't this shit only happen in the movies?\n\nI've been to this location twice now, both times out of desperation - staunch refusal to eat excrement from Panda Express versus inability to maintain attention span long enough to wait in line at Paradise. I had a falafel salad that was just covered in the most rank and odiferous onions known to mankind. My second visit, I wised up and got the falafel sandwich-no-onions, which was wrapped in a half-reheated and totally dried out pita and covered in said devil onions. Now, mind you, lunch and a pop there will easily put you out $10. That's too much money to leave unsatisfied, with roaring heartburn and breath that would singe Satan's chest hair off.\n\nPlus, the people taking orders are impatient and a little snotty. Sorry if you've run out of patience trying to explain falafel to Middle America. Please don't take it out on everyone else.\n\nThree times may be a charm, but I don't think I'll be back to this location..."
0,"Yeah - not coming back here for a while. The coaster was ok - it was a little rough and I blacked out for half a second during the loops. From the looks of it, all the games seemed pretty lame/not fun -- just funny-looking. I do like how big the place is and how there are plenty of places to explore. Adventuredome is ghetto...straight up."
1,This little spot was a pleasant surprise. We decided to go here for desert because we didn't want to spend more money at Comme Ca. The employees are friendly and happy to assist you in choosing out a flavor. We went with a white mocha latte which went down very smooth and had a rich flavor. We each had a scoop of the gelatto-- my girlfriend opted for the pistachio and i went with the chocolate chip and cream. Both very impressive-- I must say that the pistachio takes the cake because it had the strongest pistachio flavor of any ice cream i have ever had...anywhere. The chips and cream was buttery and delicious. The next time we're in the Cosmo we will probably be back for seconds.
0,"It's very different than the usual Mexican restaurant. This is Jalisco style. Not Mexican American. Authentic. Portions are small and no melted cheese on the nacos or most dishes but Athentic crumbled mexican style white chees very mild flavored.  It was okay not bad but I don't forsee myself jonesing to return.  Margarita was a bit high and I don't think they use Tequilia and I didn't see a bar. I think they may use white wine, which isn't unheard of in small family owned places in Mexico."
0,worst meal ever!!! food came out cold....bad service... old brown guacamole!!! dont do it!
0,"The food here is just awful, when my plate arrived from the \""seafood experts\"" my lobster was so dry and it looked super old, tasted like it had been in the freezer for 6 months and then cooked in the microwave, ugh. and my shrimp was soggy like oatmeal, the biscuits were super good. The service was way to much, there were about 6 customers and about 8-10 servers in the restaurant and the servers didn't  have stations so every minute you'd have a server coming by asking you the same question 4 other people just asked us...sooo annoying, our waiter chris was a nice guy and a good server but he messed with customers heads alittle to much, saying jokes that made us feel rude that we didnt laugh because we didnt understand what he was talking about, but when he asked how my food was and i said \""gross\"" he was like \""ohhh you should of told me i'd get the manager for you right now if you want\"" i said \""no i'll go to arbys down the street but thank you\"" he was saying that i should just talk to the manager and take care of it but at that point i just wanted to get out of that place.In walkes a single mom with 5 little kids with her and they sat them right next to us, the mother of the kids actually said to the server \""my kids are loud maybe we should sit somewhere else\"" then looked and me, i just smiled because it was true and i really appreciated her being thoughtful of others, so the server says \""ohh no this is fine\"" luckly the kids were not that bad at all, phew.  The host was just a freak, he was staring at us the entire time we were in the restaurant and wouldnt even look away when we stared back at him like \""whaaaaaat\"" ???? then some other server or hostess came by with our bill and said \""for your convenience\"" which i wanted to say \""it's not \""convenient\"" to pay 100 bucks for the worst seafood ever\""!!!  (but i didnt i just wanted to escape and fast) so she fails to give me a pen, so i see the host walking by and i say to him \""do you have a pen\""? and he says \""not on me\"" and pats his pockets, then a server came by and said \""ohhh i have one\""..I looked at my partner and said \""NOT ON ME ? ARE YOU KIDDING?  so walking out the door two girls held the doors for us with smiles and have a good day blah blah blah, so as we are leaving right outside the door is a huge pile of trash so we actually had to step over and into trash \"" well we thought it was over, then (yes there's more) we were stuck in our car for 5 minutes while two other cars sat behind us arguing about something, it was just so amazing how bad it was. We finally escaped shaking our heads and laughing about how we fly all the way to vegas and one of our dinner plans was going to be red lobster, what a joke! we will never eat there again....grossss! p.s. we tipped chris big because it wasnt his fault....."
0,"Where to begin...\n\nThe waitress starts off by giving us what turns out to be all you can eat garlic bread. Sounds interesting in theory. Except it isn't really good.\n\nWhen it comes time to order, I ask her to explain to me the difference between the two optional pizza sauces. It turns out that one of the two sauces has not been available for several years. Yet it's still on the menu. From several years ago. Yeah... Ok...\n\nWe order. My friend and I each order a pizza. The waitress got my friends order wrong. So as I nibbled my pizza slowly, my friend waited nearly 20 minutes for hers. \n\nOh... It's going to get better right now. The waitress now knocks over my glass of beer right onto my crotch. I really wasn't in the mood to have beer marinated underwear, but such is life. She does bring me a new glass of beer. But I'm not in the mood anymore.\n\nSo now it's time for the bill. I'm expecting to be comped for something. A decent restaurant would not give us a bill at all. But I'm figuring that she will at least remove one item from the total. Perhaps the beer? She does not. Nothing. Nothing at all. \n\nHorrible experience. Stay away people. This restaurant has on undeserved reputation of being something interesting. it's crap you would buy at your local dumpy mall."
1,Oh wow this place is awesome!  I love everything about it!  The other day after a long day at work I got there at closing time (thinking it would still be open).  I tried the door and it was locked and saw the chairs were all set up on the tables etc.  I was so sad and started to walk away and a guy there came out and asked me to come in.  He said they had only just closed so they were still working on putting the food away and would make me something first.  It was so sweet and after a long day of work it just made my day!  Their food is so yummy too and all the people that work there have always been so sweet.
0,"Just terrible.\n\nSign outside says $5 drafts - night special, Tilted Kilt night.  Great, we say!  We'd love a happy hour draft on a hot day.\n\nWe walk in, find a seat at the crowded bar, and order two Miller Lites.\n\nBill comes, and we're charged $16.  What!?  I ask, he tells me the $5 is for industry night, and only applies to those in industry.  What does that even mean?  I say the sign does not say that, and he argues it does.  I go out to the sign three times to confirm, and every time tell him it does not.\n\nHe says, well you're wrong, but because you're causing an issue, I will just charge you $10.  Of course you will, because I am not wrong (and, isn't the customer always right anyways?), and you really should check your signs, and honor them.  Maybe most of the people that come in here have really taken Vegas to the extreme so do not notice the bill, but that's just dishonest business.\n\nNever again in this location.  Never again in any location."
1,"This hotel is not one that you would frequent because it is kind of in a weird place.  We went here when we were in town specifically to take the kids to bowl and I think it is a great kid friendly place in vegas where you can bowl and even stay.  They had an arcade and they have a movie theater.  Not to mention it is super cheap and nice since it is fairly new.  I would love to stay here and try it out, but I def recommend the bowling, it was cheap and fun, good food from the snack bar and the arcade is right by there too."
1,Wow.. I can't believe I haven't posted a review for this place!\n\nI'm  inspired to write this review after a recent poor experience at a local sephora store here in Calgary Canada. \n\nI've had one of the most memorable shopping experiences at this specific Sephora store. The staff here is AMAZING. Completely worth me saving every single loonie (dollar dollar bills) to go back and make all my makeup purchases here. I am an excessive makeup buyer.. and am committed to only going here! Yes well worth the travel and wait. \n\nI must say that the makeup artist who helped us (Lino) was AMAZING. He helped me explore new makeup and looks and... sigh. Wish he lived here and could be my personal makeup consultant all the time! \n\nI highly recommend stopping in here and asking a sales rep for help with a new look. Everyone there was so knowledgeable. Wish service like this was found everywhere.

0,"How can I give a restaurant anything higher than 2 stars when they serve burnt hashbrowns (I posted a picture). It looked fine when they brought it over but as I was eating it, it tasted really weird so I looked on the bottom and it was BLACK!.  I don't know how a chef/cook can ever serve anyone something so burnt. I wouldn't even care if had a little burn on the edge but this thing was ALL black and it was awful.  Never in my life have I been served something like that. \n\nMy friend had the crepe which I tasted and it was really good. She also ordered the country potato over the hashbrown which was a good move for her. \n\nAfter I complained they brought back a hot new order of hashbrown but it took a while (about 15 minutes) and they didn't seem too apologetic so I wasn't very pleased. I have no plans to go back!"
0,"OK, let me first state that I shop here often, they have lots of my hard earned dollars over the years. They have a lot more to offer consumers than most electronic stores. My last visit on Saturday October 15th, 2011, I was interested in purchasing a product that would a) wirelessly transfer content from my PC to my HDTV or b) wirelessly transfer content from the internet to my HDTV. \n\nI spoke to a sale rep in the TV section about the Logitech Revue. When I asked him if he knew anything about the product, how it worked, performance, etc he said he knew nothing. I asked if he could refer me to someone who did, he then went on to say all you have to do is hook it up to your TV and proceeded to walked away. NOT MUCH HELP HERE...\n\nSo I decided I would visit the computer section in the store.  I asked a sales rep about the capability of my computer that I purchased at Fry's about 4-months ago. He proceeded to check the Sony laptop specs on the Fry's website; however the computer I purchased from Fry's about 4-months ago was not listed as an item they sell anymore. What gives?? After some prompting I was able to get him to look on the Sony website where he reviewed the specs and said that a Push2TV type product would be able to wirelessly send my PC content to my HDTV. When I asked where I could find these products I was expecting him to show me personally where they are located and possibly give me more information about each. Instead he pointed to a corner in the store to make my way to without any further assistance. WHAT GIVES??\n\nAfter much deliberation and very little direction from Fry's sales staff I decided to purchase the Logitech Revue simply because it appeared to be the easiest of all products to access the web, Netflix, etc. While still looking around I came across the Roku unit in the PC parts location of the store. I was looking over their display and another customer approached and also began to look over the product. I asked him if he knew anything about the Roku, he went on to say he had tried it and returned it earlier and decided to try the Sony TV box. I went on to comment I wish the sales staff at Fry's was more helpful and he too stated he received no help when asking about these products as well from the Fry's sales staff.\n\nSo, not a good experience at all. VERY Disappointing when compared to Best Buys sales staff that have always sought me out and took plenty of time answering my questions which allowed me to make a better informed purchasing decision.\n\nBEST BUY here I come!!!!!!!!\n\nUPDATE: After reviewing the Logitech Revue installation instructions at home and calling Logitech I determined this product lacks the capability of connecting to Hulu, the big boy networks of ABC, CBS, NBC, etc. therefore I returned it to fry's for a refund. Sure would have been nice to know these limitations on the front end. \n\nYOU GOTTA BE KIDDING!!!!\n\nAgain, BEST BUY will get my business!!!"
1,"In a rush to get from point A to point B but still enjoy a nice lager or ale... I found myself on the front porch of the \""Peaks\"" peeking at a beverage listing and selecting a pasta dish.\nReally what sold me on giving the forth star was that there was a very wide array of foods for a brewery house and the chicken rolls that we got while we were waiting for our entrees.  Divine.  \n\nIt was a good night in the Valley and I can never complain when I am supplied Ace Pear Ale on tap!  A secret weapon that may have pushed that extra star out of me."
1,"Love this place. Been bringing my daughter since she was 5 months old. 6 years later, we still come every week! Love the staff!"
1,"This is an awesome place...step back in time with amazing decor, baseball memorabilia, and caring service.  This restaurant  was the first one built in Scottsdale (and a different location first), and the floors were handmade wood...before tongue and groove.  The menu includes its specialty of sirloin steak, but I had the liver and onions and my sister enjoyed a mouth-watering hand-pressed burger.  Stiff drinks.  Fruit cocktail on the menu.  \n\nWe expected Frank Sinatra to walk in the door at any minute.  The bar singer Steve York (on Friday and Saturday nights) reminds you of a cruise singer...fun...engaging the audience.  This was the place to be during spring training time, and owners Charlie (who died in 2002) and Gwen knew all the players by name and handed out a free steak dinner to the guys who hit homeruns. \n\nThis is a place not to be missed!!!"
1,Great place. Bartenders are laid back but still professional. Def a place I will come to again and again. Nice bottle beer list. $3 bottle beer on tues and half price wine on wed. Can't complain with that. If your at the bar make sure Manny is taking care of you. It'll make your night that much more enjoyable
1,"What a wonderful store! It goes without saying that their collection is amazing but then again, anybody could have a good stock of wine and spirits. What I like the most about going to BevMo! Is the very helpful and cheerful staff. I have never been in there when I was not greeted and asked if I needed help. But in retail there is a fine line between \""helpful\"" and \""pushy\"" - they must go through training in order to recognize a certain look on your face to know when you actually need help."
1,Great Bagels and people were very nice. We will be back soon! Love the mom and pop feel.
0,"REVIEW IS FOR THE CASINO ONLY\n\nIt was a no win situation for us at the Wynn. The slot machines are money hungry man eaters. The only way that you'll get any money from here is if the machine is asking you for a 4 digit pin. The table games minimum are set pretty high, so if you are a serious gambler... bring your cash flow here."
0,These people are morons. Put sugar in when ask for no sugar . Give you wrong food. It has happened more then once. Dumb dumbs
0,"Good atmosphere, average food, but a lot to worry about as far as menu & other policies is concerned.  Food is consistent, bread is above average, and prices are within normal range for Phoenix.\n\nWhy are the traditional appetizers available ONLY on Saturday and Sunday, and ONLY between 12:00 and 6:00?  Vegetable Pakorka, Samosa, Chole Poori, and more... only available on 2 days a week.  Why?  This is crazy.  \n\nClosed Mondays.\n\nCommon to be closed entirely for private parties, or they switch to take-out only because of private parties.\n\nAloo Mattar is a lunch special.  Another dish (eggplant) is a lunch special.  Neither one is on the regular menu, and it is hit and miss with whether or not the evening chef can make them.\n\nThere is little difference between medium, medium hot, and hot.  If you order extra hot (chef's hot) there's a huge jump.  They just can't get it right."
1,"I now have stayed at TI twice, the first time was a couple of years ago I organized a large bachelorette party for 20 girls here and I recently stayed here with a co-worker for a conference that was across the street at the Venitian.   Treasure Island was a great option for a moderately priced hotel for both purposes for my trips to Vegas.  The beds are comfortable and the room decor is trendy and looked recently renovated.  There are a few good options for drinks or appetizers onsite; and a selction of restaruants, though not upscale, offer decent dining options.   The casino is not as large as other hotels, which may dissappoint gambling fans, but also felt quieter and made the hotel easier to navigate than other Vegas hotels I have been in.   The location on the strip is very good with more upscale hotels such as the Venetian  and tons of shopping very close by.   \n\nThere are a few negatives to this hotel.  The Sirens of TI show occurs several times a night, which is fine if your purpose in Vegas is to stay out late so you never hear it anyway; but can get obnoxious if you are actually in your room which faces the show and hear the blasts of the fireworks night after night.   Most people in Vegas will opt to eat dinner out; however, if for some reason you are eating in your room I do not reccommend TI room service.  It was very expensive and the food was greasy.  \nAside from the the less than stellar room service; TI is a great option for trendy and nice, yet budget friendly option."
0,C'est grand.\nC'est un peu bruyant.\nC'est pas mal.\nMais c'est surtout beaucoup moins bien que L'Avenue !
1,I have been coming here since the place opened in 1994  and it is ALWAYS consistent. The deep dish pizza is authentic as you can get  here in the Las Vegas valley. The Cheef and Italian beef sandwiches are very good as well. This place has been here 17 years which is a eternity for this town!!
1,Not only is the bbq close to me but I can also get gas and a car wash at the same location lol. The food is really good but the sauce is just so so and thats the only reason it's not getting a 5 star.
1,"I only go to Just Vapin' for my Vape needs. They've got a huge selection of juices, and the staff is great!"
1,Love it here! The owner is so sweet she always does my eyebrows and they're perfect every time. This place is the only place I go to get my eyebrows threaded for the past 3 years I've been in the area! I dont need to worry about them getting messed up when I go here. It's clean and convenient.
0,you suck. i've waited for hours in the west end for a cab. you're more like an airport car service than citywide cab service.
1,"I had work done elsewhere, here in Las Vegas and wasn't all that happy with the work. I took my new Stingray into Eco-Tint and had a clear bra and window tint done on it. Mike and Jay have been wonderful to do business with. They do business the old fashion way, the customer comes first. This is the only place I will use for all of my cars or recommend to any of my friends. Thanks Mike and Jay for your excellent care of my car and me."
0,"Unfortunately I am unable to comment as far as actual LASIK because Schwartz Laser Eye Center canceled my appointment one week before I scheduled to fly in for the eye evaluation and surgery.  If you are thinking about flying in from out of town to visit Schwartz, I do not recommend it.\n\nI live in Los Angeles, and decided to have LASIK in Phoenix because I have family out there who could drive me to and from both appointments.  I booked a flight, took time off of work, and had a family remember request both days off of work so they could drive me to the appointments.  I received a call yesterday that they needed to reschedule because Dr. Schwartz was going out of town.  I reminded them that I am specifically flying in for this appointment (and she even confirmed this information was in my file... meaning, they knew about this prior to calling me), but the receptionist just said \""I know, we are really frustrated too.\""  Right, but the receptionist didn't just waste a couple hundred dollars on a flight and ask family members to take time off work.  \n\nTo top it off, I received both a text message and an email this morning confirming my appointment for next week.  Call me crazy, but if you are going to cancel appointments last minute, you probably don't want to send out confirmations directly afterward.  \n\nI'm shocked at the level of customer service I received from a doctor that is in the business of performing elective surgery (that can cost upwards of $5,000!).  It seems as though other people have had great experiences with Schwartz... I just wish I could've been one of them."
0,"YUCK! And YUCK!! Hubby and I went here for my birthday. We both ordered the fish and chips. Talk about GROSS!! I asked for mine to be well done and it came out way under cooked. The breading was just soggy and the fish was cooked \""rare\"". My husbsnds wss the same. Needless to say we didn't eat it. We were shocked that they put a 27 dollar price tag on it too. The service was abysmally slow as well. This place is probably okay if you just want to drink."
0,"This is a warning.  Stay away from these people!  While the workers themselves do their jobs admirably, the managers and company are adept at ripping you off.  \""Sign up for a detailing and you get two free car washes.\"" Except that one of those \""free\"" car washes is used up by the detailing!  And heaven help you if you want a refund!  two months later we're still trying despite having filled out all the paperwork - twice!  Consider yourself warned!"
1,"This place has the best donuts in Tempe! Their breakfast sandwiches are good and filling, with quite the variety. I highly recommend trying this place, especially if you have a late night donut craving."
1,"The best place to experience comic book culture. It's crammed with books, comics, and toys. You have to explore every nook and cranny to see everything they have. \n\nThe owner \""My name is Howard not Greg\"" is super friendly and funny. I'm not sure if this is true, but if he likes you and you're not a doosh, he'll sell you stuff less than cover price!\n\nI was buying comics when cover prices were 50 cents, so discounts on these $4 comics is awesome.\n\nOh yeah, no one knows about this: Ask to see the HELLBOY mural in the bathroom!"
0,"First, the with positives.  Service was fine.  Server was pleasant, attentive and offered to resolve the issues associated with the food.  Creamed Corn was good with fresh corn and good blend of peppers and spice.  It was a tad cornstarchy though.  Place was pretty full for reasons I will never understand.\n\nThen, came the food.  I root for restaurants.  I really do.  Especially when someone opens a new restaurant close to my house, I especially want it to be good.  When we heard that Chef Bret from Becker's was behind the stoves, we were especially optimistic having been to Becker's dozens of times as a Westside alternative to DelFrisco's, N9ne, Ruth's Chris, or Prime.  So we tried Embers a couple weeks after they opened and ordered a myriad of menu selections only to have various combinations of Sysco lettuce and vegetables show up with stale bread and temperatures all over the board.  \n\nWe chalked it up to opening jitters.  Tonight, we elected to go back because we heard that they had revamped the menu and the food.  Oh my god.  We ordered the Eggplant and fresh mozzerella melt ($8.00)  for an appetizer.  It arrived promptly and was a crusty dry tasteless piece of toast with an ultra-thin tasteless sliver of what appeared to be eggplant under a half-dollar piece of lukewarm cheap mozzerella.  It was served on a bed of Sysco generic mixed greens with generic diced tomatoes.  It was drizzled with a balsamic vinegar reduction which was barely noticable but it was the highlight of the awful awful tasteless dish.\n\nThe Mrs. ordered the chicken cobb salad ($12.00) and I ordered the 12 oz., New York. ($32.00)    The chicken cobb was a serving plate of iceberg lettuce that looked like they just dumped a bag of iceberg lettuce from Von's onto a plate complete with some of the core.  The chicken on it was moist but it was unable to save the salad.\n\nThen came the 12 oz. New York.  I have eaten probably 50 steaks at restaurants in the past year, some of which at restaurants I would never bring a date.  Some of them at bars and truck-stoppy places where you have no business ordering a steak.    This was the worst steak I have had in several years.  It was ordered medium rare.  It came as a grey slab of meat with a couple of criss-cross marks in it which looked like they were colored on it.  \n\nI gave it a try to see perhaps if the taste was better than the microwave looking grey slab of putrid looking garbage that was staring at me from the plate.  It was as gross as it looked.  I thought it had to be a mistake, because I could not imagine that Applebee's or Chili's or Outback puts out anything quite as awful as this mess.\n\nI asked the server whether all the steaks look like this, and whether they are cooked like this.  She replied that she would be happy to take it to the back and char it more for me.  I passed as that would just mean that they would cook it way past medium rare as I ordered it and they would end up giving me a medium well steak which would be as bad as the thing on the plate.  I tried to stomach a couple of bites, and the steak, rather than a meaty salty piece of steak, tasted like lemon.  I don't get it.\n\nThen some sort of manager type guy came up and stated that the steak was cooked over redwood in a broiler of something.  He further stated that told the chef that they were, from now on, going to char their steaks more.  Thanks.  That made me feel a lot better that I, after 9 months of being open, told them that they were cooking steaks that looked like they were microwaved.  \n\nThey charged me for everything even though we only ate 1/2 of the eggplant garbage and half the \""steak\"".  I'm not looking for a free dinner.  \n\nIn fact, if I was given a $1000.00 gift certificate to Embers, I would sell it for $200.00 and take the cash to any other restaurant in Boca Park area including, Flemming's, Roy's, Cheesecake Factory, Kona Grill, Applebees, Three Angry Wives, or Roberto's at Fabulous Freddy's Car Wash across the street."
0,Meh
1,"First time there, and the fried chicken was one of the best I have had.  The sides of mashed potatoes and gravy, with biscuits, were less than stellar, however.  Nevertheless, the staff was friendly, and the chicken was great."
0,"Not a fan.\n\nThe paella was not very good. It was wet and overly salted. It needed more saffron or other spices.\n\nThey made us come at 6 - early - but didn't even take our wine order until 6.45 and we didn't get our wine until 7.15. It was unreal. The place was basically empty at 7, so I have no clue why they insisted we come at 6. The service was borderline humorous, but if I wasn't on vacation I probably would have gone insane or just left. \n\nAlso felt very touristy and didn't seem like there were many locals there. Maybe just my impression, but we really didn't like this place."
1,"If McDonalds is the Toyota Corolla of the fast food world, Chick-fil-A is the Rolls Royce or Range Rover.  Yes, you will pay a little bit more than the dollar menu options at McDonalds or Taco Bell, but the quality is also light years ahead.  Chick-fil-A has pioneered the chicken sandwich, and they do it better than anyone else in town... yes, even better than Bojangles.  And the Plaza location has their act together; every day, they get slammed with a hungry lunchtime crowd of bankers, Duke Energy-ers, etc, and they consistently manage to fill orders correctly, quickly, and tastily.  Their hours are a bit shortened compared to other locations, as they close at 4pm, but stop by for breakfast or lunch (or an afternoon ice dream or milkshake snack!), and you won't be disappointed."
1,I've never been but the line looks huge. Five stars! Also once I saw someone get knocked outside five stars
0,"I hate to be the one of unpopular opinion here, but my overall experience here wasn't that great. \n\nDrinks were decent, amuse bouche of asparagus mousse was pretty good, and the souffles were fabulous as described.\n\nHowever, neither of our entrees were good. My husband got the vegetarian crepes (the only vegetarian item on the menu) and found them pleasing at first, but overpowering after a few bites. I tasted it, too - it's like whoever created it didn't actually try to sit down and eat a whole one.\n\nFor me, the lobster was so tough and stringy that I had a difficult time cutting it with a knife. No delicious dessert can make up for that sort of problem. \n\nOh, I forgot, we ordered sides as well. The potato croquettes were pretty good as long as they were piping hot. Once the temperature went more toward warm, you could taste the grease, which to me is not ideal.\n\nI'm happy to pay a premium for a great meal/service/ambience, but I expected much better from this place, especially in Vegas where competition is stiff."
0,"I have gone here a few times in the last few years. I remember one time, ordering the sliders... DISGUSTING!!! It tasted like rotten meat... or as if the meat had fallen on the ground and put back on the buns. GROSS. It was game day, so it took forever getting the food, so we never complained or asked for another order since we had been starving. I ate the fries ONLY. Then, another time I visited, we asked for Pizza Rolls (thinking maybe they're as good as Casey Jones'). Nope... they were friggin Totino's pizza rolls, probably like $4 for a box of them at the grocery store, but $6.95 here. The next time I went, I didn't order food, I knew better! Don't have much to say about drinks, since I had nothing but water. Even that doesn't taste great though, like tap water. Great atmosphere for games, but just atrocious food."
1,"If you want a deal for your buck, this is the place to go! You'll find Dewalt, Makita, Oster, Cuisinart, Farberware, Keurig, and many other banded items for a fraction of the original retail price. Yes, some items will be out the package, missing a manual, or may have a scratch or a dent but I rather pay a fraction of the price versus paying full retail at a department store. I rather save money and get a ridiculous deal for the same exact item I would have paid 10X more at a well organized and clean shop. From what I know this store has been open for nearly ten years; the owners are one of the nicest people I've met; they even offer free delivery with the furniture or any other large item you purchase. Stop by!! You'll get a kick from just walking down the unorganized, messy aisles; but once you get to the register to pay- you'll be happy!! \""Get more for less!\"""
0,"I had a horrible experience there Sept. 26, 2013 during happy hour.  I was in a group of 25 people from meetup.com that met there that night. Everything was going fine till at the very end as I finishing up my final drink.  We ran individual tabs and I already paid my tab.  Apparently because I was one of the last to leave the table I was accosted by a Via Brasil employee about someone else in the group whom I did not personally know who did not pay her tab and the employee demanded me to pay her tab.  I told him I already paid mine and I shouldn't be penalized because of a deadbeat I didn't personally know.  Then I started being treated like I myself was a deadbeat because the whole staff subsequently circled me and threatened the police on me if I didn't pay.  I looked around and noticed everyone else in the group was gone.  I had no choice but to pay and I ended up doing so by slamming the money to pay for the deadbeat's tab on the table and I let them know that they were over the top on me and they don't care about potential future business they could have received from me.  I let the group leader know by email about the experience later that night and the next day she did meet me and paid me back, which was nice.  Over the next several days I called Via Brasil to speak with the owner to discuss my bad experience because the staff was so hard up about collecting the money from me even if I did not personally owe them that money...I was told each time the owner was not there and I left messages that went unreturned.  The same occurred with an email I sent to the owner.  Via Brasil should be ashamed for hiring people who will use extreme measures to get their money even from people who don't personally owe a tab left behind by someone else."
0,"This used to be our go-to delivery place, but they must have changed owners or management or something. Regardless, the pizza comes cold, the cheese is partially melted, it tastes frozen, and tonight they took 2 hours before I called the manager and refused delivery. Late, cold, crappy pizza? No thanks, I'll spend my cash elsewhere."
0,"While there were no insect carcasses in my food, I was still not very impressed with my meal at PF Chang's.  I went for a \""business lunch\"" with my boss.  Who thought I would ever enjoy working more than eating??--I think this meal was a first!\n\nI got steamed veggies and brown rice.  Now I expected it to be pretty bland, since it mentioned no sauces added at all.  But the vegetables were rubbery, not crisp like they should be after a good steaming. The rice was pretty underdone as well, so all-in-all, they got nothing right.  I tried adding some sauces to liven it up a bit, but it was too little, too late.\n\nPerhaps the biggest disappointment was the egg drop soup.  I usually add pepper to mine because I like the extra kick, but this needed much more help than a little pepper.  It was very bland, and didn't taste like anything.  Tasteless egg in water is definitely NOT something you want to keep eating.  And, of course, there was no salt and pepper on the table, so I couldn't even enjoy it the way I like. \n\nBecause I didn't pay, I didn't complain to the waiter, but normally this would not have passed by me.  Though the lunch prices are pretty reasonable, I still would not return here if given the choice."
1,C section was very empty when we fly out on a Monday night. Security lined moved quickly and it's a pretty clean airport. The water from the filter water refill station tasted salty and gross though.
1,My favorite is your Gorgonzola bread & my husband loves the monterrey pepper jack with spicy tomato oil. I used DukesBread parsley oil to marinate chicken breasts and cooked them on the grill...they were fantastic!  I've also used it as a sauce over salmon.  You have consistently great products - many thanks! We will see you every Sat!
1,"The GF and I stopped by this place about a week ago for some good ol' Que. This place is fairly small and most of the employees seemed to be family.\n\nI was fairly hungry and figured \""I'm at the rib crib, I should order the ribs.\"" (usually not what I order at BBQ). I ordered the full rack baby backs with 2 sides for......$18.... I think. My sides were the sweet potato fries and mac and cheese.  The GF ordered \""Lots O' Meat Deal\"". She ordered the pulled pork and 2 orders of brisket (the girl loves her some brisket) with sweet potato fries and fried okra. I think it was about $15. \n \nSo our food came out in a timely manner and we started gobbling it up. My ribs were very tender. The first bone I picked up slid out of the meat. They weren't soggy but not dry either. I can't tell you how much I LOVED THE BBQ SAUCE. The ribs seemed to be boiled then grilled... not the way I usually enjoy them (smoked.......mmmm....) but none the less very tasty. The sweet potato fries were crispy not mushy like most, very good, and the mac and cheese wasn't the creamy version but more of a casserole type...not the best but pretty good. Oh ya and the cornbread was not very good... I don't think I even ate it all...that's very unusual. I'm a cornbread junkie.\n\nThe GF's plate was filled with SO MUCH MEAT!!!!!!!! AHA.... I just wanted to shove my face into the plate and inhale....what a great death that would be..... anyways......2 huge portions of brisket and a huge helping of pulled pork. I have to say everything on her plate was defiantly worth eating again. Brisket was nicely sliced and the pork was extremely soft and tender. As far as I could tell none of their meat is smoked but as I said before it was still very good. Her fried okra was also good and I'm not a huge okra fan.\n\nDidn't try any of the desserts (had to save room for AYCE sushi 4 hours later) but they all looked fabulous. \n\nI would officially give this place 3.5 stars but I'm gonna round up not down for the yelp score. Service was great and everyone was extremely friendly. \n\nTHE BBQ SAUCE AT THIS JOINT IS ON POINT!!!!\n\nCheck 'em out... I recommend the \""Lots O' Meat Meal Deal\"".... it's a lot of food for a real good price and you can sample three things they offer at the same time."
0,"Meh, my husband and I weren't impressed at all. I had the Orchard Chicken Sandwich with Sweet Potato fries. They were both room temp which just sucks. The sandwich had great flavor but needed more of the elements, not enough caramelized onions or apples. Husband liked Cowboy burger but seasoned fries were way over the top on seasoning. Good service, great atmosphere, bleh quality. If the quality was stepped up to excellence they'd have something great going!"
1,"This is honestly the best coffee I've found in Vegas. I absolutely love the atmosphere and the employees are always so sweet. Amazing pastries too! Try an iced cappuccino, delish!!"
0,"This reminds me of that \""putting lipstick on a pig\"" saying. Sure, Sundrops is much prettier and more upscale than your typical strip mall nail place, but the experience and results were no different.\n\nI found the tech, Rakhil, to be very rude. I realize some of it was due to cultural differences, but geez, she's in a service industry. I felt awful when she rolled her eyes at me a few times during our conversations. This is why I avoid the Vietnamese places as I have always found the techs to be too blunt and insulting.\n\nThe mani-pedi was painful, and it made one of my fingers bleed. Luckily, no infection. I paid an extra $10 for the callous remover, but it didn't help at all. The Essie paint is very cute, but I'll give myself the credit for picking out a unique color (mint apple).\n\nI'm glad I had the groupon to give it a shot, but there's no way I'll ever go back."

I hope it was worth sleeping in..."
0,"This is by far the worst Thai restaurant I've ever been to. The servers are rude and slow, and the food is awful. Everything pretty much looks and tastes the same. The waiter seemed annoyed that my eating partner complained that his soda was flat, and brought him another flat soda. When he complained again, the waiter told him to see the host on the way out.  If you are in the area, there are many better choices for a good meal, other than this place."
0,No coffee maker...no room service! Ridiculous!!   They were really ill-prepared for the charllotte marthon and serving hundreds of runners. No complementary water or fruit in the lobby. Ran out of coffee and checkout for runners was noon.
1,"We visited Federal Pizza a week after it opened to give the crowds a bit to die down (of course they never do). The interior is charming, as with all of the Upward Project restaurant designs. We are very excited to have another wonderful neighborhood restaurant. \n\nDrive through lane: If you call in your order, you can pull in to pick it up via the drive through lane. Very happy with this, as you don't have to get out of your car (like at Postino's), given it is a majority valet parking. \n\nStaff: Staff is awesome and friendly.\n\nPizza: To date, we have tried the Big Star Pizza (a family favorite); Also one with prosciutto and dates (my personal favorite); and one with meatballs (our least favorite). Pizza dough was a tad doughy, otherwise it is fantastic.\n\nDessert: Must try the chocolate mouse with the oreo crust and home made marshmellows on top. My only complaint is that they can't make it up to go via drive through :("
1,"This place is a must \""eat\"". I had the green chili soup and the roast beef and blue cheese sandwich. Who knew you could get great green chili in Vegas. Next the roast beef sandwich was so good. The flavor of the melted blue cheese with the roast beef blended well and the soft bread made it that much better. Check this out if your in the downtown area."
1,"Yeah.....Great New Place to eat Indian food! Clean & Friendly atmosphere:) We wanted fresh food & exactly what we tasted! You will wait 13 minutes for your homemade fresh samosa to arrive. From the way everything is served to you...to the taste in your mouth...you will want more!! We wanted to try everything! Every time we go back we will have to try something new...chef gets his lamb imported from New Zealand:) A+ Samosa, Garlic Naan, & don't leave without having the mango cake...light dessert that you won't want to share! Thank you Amanda & staff for a beautiful experience....we walked into a clean bistro & felt like we life an elegant 5 star restaurant! Worth every penny.!"
0,"I was looking for a new nail salon the other day, and based on the reviews I thought that I would give this place a try. I do have to give them some credit because it was a Saturday afternoon and they were very busy, but I can't say that I was all that impressed by this establishment. The salon was clean, and so were the tools, however, if you are not a regular client don't expect them to pay much attention to you. I only received a pedicure because a wanted to try the place out before I made a commitment to this salon. They did a nice job, however, I don't think that I will be going back. Its a shame that they ignore all of their new customers, because I was really looking forward to make this my go to spot for my custom acrylic nails. I guess the search for a new nail salon continues!"
1,Had a great meal with friends and co-workers.  Had an easy time reserving a table for seven and the service was prompt and the food was enjoyable.  One of the things I like is the openness of the restaurant and the ambiance that is created.
1,"I've been coming here for about 6 months now, every week and a half or so.  In the 7 or so years that I've lived here I've mainly gone to 4 different barber shops (depending on where I lived).  This place is interesting....  Never seen a place quite like it.  Typically when I've moved to a new city, I try to find a good \""ghetto\"" barber...  pardon the expression.  But typically the best barber shops are well....  not usually located in the best parts of town.  When I moved to vegas I did the same.... found MLK blvd and viola!  Good barber shops.  But that's too far a drive....\n\nAnyway, this place is good...  similar style to your typical predominantly black barber shop....  although everyone that works there is hispanic.  And it's located in the middle of China Town.  Haha...  They get a good mix of customers, mostly hispanic...  but not a big deal, they almost all speak english well enough (one guy I can think of doesn't).  I usually go early mornings and never really have to wait long... although later in the day they can get busy... and it's hard to tell who has appts. when you just walk in.  \n\nBottom line.... they're friendly enough, and do a pretty good fade.   That's all I need to know.   Oh, and cash only.... although I believe they have an ATM there."
0,"There's no their defined \""ticket rules\"" in any forms of instruction. So by the time we have waited for 30 minutes to get into the buffet. The lady in the front desk just said \""oh , u need to press the machine for ticket and get into the line AGAIN\"" \nMaybe it's just the \""Excellent service\"" they can provide........."
0,"Wait is too long! \n\nFirst visit - appointment was scheduled for 11 am and we didn't see the doctor until 2 pm. \n\nSecond Visit - appointment was scheduled for 10:15. We came in at 10:10 am with no one waiting in the office and at 11 am we were still waiting, so decided to leave, and find another doctor. \n\nTried to give her the benefit of the doubt from the first time because she was kinda busy the first time but after experiencing the second visit, we knew this was going to be a recurring matter. \n\nPlace is just starting off so expect a lot of amateur mistakes and limited amounts of equipment to even be called an OB/GYN."
0,Our bartender didn't know what a pint was or how to pour a beer
1,"This barre studio is fabulous. I have tried barre at different places, and this is probably my favorite. The instructors really challenge you, and they are always making sure you have the right form. Even two days after a work out I am still feeling it, but still looking forward to the next class! Alyssa is very helpful and responds timely, despite how busy she gets!  And having this studio right across the street from my house doesn't hurt either! :)"
1,"Arrived at Tix 4 Tonight Sunday morning around 9:30AM to get tickets to see the Jabbawockeez at the Monte Carlo and was very pleased with the prices that Tix 4 Tonight displayed on their LCD monitors - it was a huge discount compared to how much the tickets would have cost me had I bought online at VEGAS.com or directly from the Monte Carlo ticket booth. \n\nI'm assuming that because we were at the box office so early there wasn't a huge line so keep that in mind. The staff was friendly and definitely didn't try to push us to see a specific show; they did however, have a package for discounted buffets if you're interested in that. \n\nOverall, service was fast and friendly. i'll definitely come back again to Tix 4 Tonight when I want to see a show in Vegas."
0,Sat over 20 mins waiting for a server. It was slow at 2:30p and they had 2 servers. Asked the manager what was up with the long wait and we were told we hadn't been waiting long. He was rude and we decided to leave based on his response.
1,"Places like this make me wish I was a cow.  Aside from the royalty checks I'd get for the Chik-fil-A promotion, the best part would be having more than one stomach!  More stomachs equals more food in my belly, duh!\n\nThis is one of my favorite restaurants in Charlotte, and I always bring out-of-towners to this location.  On this special day, they ran a buffet-style offering instead of their award-winning brunch on Sundays.  The thought of buffet usually makes me cringe because the quality and quantity of food usually amounts to a lackluster meal in my opinion.  But like Ankiel on opening day, Georges knocked it out of the ballpark!  Confession:  I didn't actually watch the first MLB game of the season--seriously, the Astros?\n\nThe buffet was not your run-of-the-mill buffet.  It had a wide spread of selections with enough French influence that made it special.  I was hoping to take pictures, but let's face it, who can wait to take pictures when the food looks that good.  Chef Dodd and the rest of the kitchen did a phenomenal job of preparing everything.  Omelettes, quiche with caramelized onions, shrimp cocktail, prime rib and  the rest was a great way to celebrate Easter.  Everything they offered didn't have the buffet-quality food I had expected.  Shrimps looked vibrant and held firm, mixed fruits was bursting with flavor akin to the Starburst commercials, and the grilled chicken was succulent.  This restaurant continues to uphold the fine standard of French cuisine, and the creativity the restaurant offers will persist in making this place one of my favorites.  \n\nWho do I talk to about getting more holidays put on the calendar so Georges will run more special events? \n\ndmo out"
0,This place can eat my ass!! I went to the deli to get a sandwhich. \n\nSo I asked the clerk if they used any partially hydrogenated oils.\n\nShe had to call her corporate office.\n\nThey called her back to tell her the verdict...........................\n\n(..........................= drumroll)\n\nBingo!  The harmfull oil is in there wheat bread and the white bread!!!\n\nAMAZING!! I could never support a supposed health food store that uses an oil like that. \n\nIf you dont know how bad it is. peep this out\n\nbantransfat.com
1,The smoothies are always delicious and the staff is excellent! All good energy and good vibes. The strawberry raspberry banana is my all time favorite.
1,"Love this place! I've been going here since they were tiny with just a handful of tables, before they expanded. A great mom n' pop place that offers both great service and food! Try the buffalo chicken pizza, delicious!!!"
0,"On the surface, a not bad hotel. Not in a great location, not a big Vegas extravaganza, almost Kimpton in it's redesign. But don't let the surface details fool you-this is a varnished cardboard mock up of a nice hotel. All the details are as cheap as possible, and you'll be nickle and dimed in unexpected ways, and screwed to big dollars signs in the ways you'd expect.  And the spa? I walked put after being kept waiting for 25 minutes for my appointment, so I can't speak to the actual experience (that was the hotel's unforgivable moment)\n\nTropicana is lipstick on a pig. Expect nothing, and it's probably worth staying here"
1,"Dave & Andy's is my favorite place to pick up ice cream on a waffle cone in Oakland. Customers will disagree on their favorite flavor, but all residents of Oakland can agree that the smell from the housemade waffle cones which is emitted from Dave & Andy's adds a delicious aroma to the corner of Forbes and Atwood.\n\nNote, D&A's only accepts cash."
1,"By far one of my favorite overall dining experiences in Vegas. The food is executed with care, the staff is wArm and inviting. The wine list is solid, and the vibe of this small spot, has enough nostalgia, and swankyness to take make you feel like you truly are in a hidden gem that few know about. Don't be a moron and not try this place it's one of the best around"
1,Very good lunch here. Really enjoyed the lasagna and Veal Parmesan. Their marinara is very good.
1,"Fantastic savory and sweet crepes.  The light and very tasty crepes are served with a small salad topped with mandarin oranges and a champagne vinaigrette.  I have tried the salmon with creme fraiche, ham and cheese with their soytang sauce and plain butter with sugar.  \n\nThe place gets a bit crowded around noon and they have a pretty strict policy about ordering before you choose a seat.  Also, they only take cash (crepes run $7-9 plus $2 drinks).\n\nThey may have some mildly unpleasant/unpopular 'rules' but I can honestly say I've never had a bad meal here and plan on returning."
1,"(Will probably be a five star when I can get a cold beer to enjoy with my BBQ) \nFirst tried their smoked beef jerky at a charity golf tournament before they opened and it was delicious. The interior is beautifully done and a tribute the the owner of this franchise who also builds custom log homes. They are serious about smoked meats as you might derive from the name and it doesn't disappoint. All the meats I have tried (jerky, brisket, tri-tip, baby back ribs & sausage) are smoked perfectly and really did not require any sauce to enhance the flavor. If you prefer sauce on your meats they have you covered as well. Both the regular and the southwest style are very good. I haven't tried to many of the sides yet, but the jalapeno beans and coleslaw were both pretty good. I really love the enthusiasm and knowledge of the GM and the staff. Very friendly and knowledgeable about the food and the history of the restaurant. It has a small family owned feel to the business that I hope they are able to keep as they expand the concept outside of New Mexico and Arizona. Definitely a home run for me and I will make it a regular in the rotation."
0,"One of the worst check in experiences at PHX, but very consistent with poor US Air check in processes across the country.  It is quite obvious that the layout designer and process engineer responsible for the check-in \""corral\"" have zero practical experience in queuing theory and capacity planning that strives to remove bottlenecks not exacerbate then.  The check in in experience is poor and an in effective use of US Air personnel,  which undoubtedly impacted my high ticket price."
0,"They had fantastic and affordable brunch service on Sundays, but abysmal service, an odd corking fee structure, and inconvenient hours. \n\nThe concept was beautiful. It was a shame to see them close. Here's hoping that Istanbul, the new business operating in the same space, has a better run with things."
0,Really need shorter waiting lines- it got worse. \nThe valet is annoying and gets in the way.
0,Me and my wife sat down on a slow Tuesday night. Very cool place. Sad part when was I wanted to order I asked the server can you tell me about the menu? The culture? Your favorites?  She didn't have a clue of what was going on! We left! Doh management please give your staff the tools they need to exceed the guests expectations.
0,"Sushi to go in downtown: amazing concept!\n\nIn reality....the sushi tastes like...to go sushi.  You know, the kind you get at Giant Eagle, Whole Foods or other grocery stores.  Except way less options and more expensive.  \n\nIf I was working downtown and I was craving sushi hardcore, would I buy it from here? Maybe if I didn't have time to stop in at Penn Ave Fish Co and I was in dire need of a sushi fix.  Okay, let's face it.  I probably wouldn't.  Skip it and head to Penn Ave.  There's always time for good sushi!"
0,"I don't know if their food quality dropped or people here really don't have high expectations for Japanese food. It's not made to order and the sushi aren't delicate at all. The tampura came soggy. Overall, I expect more from the food for the price I paid."
1,"Some of the best mexican food I've ever eaten. They've been in business since 1969 (at the old location), stop by and find out why.  Lunch fajitas are delicious and a great deal to boot."
1,Great food and environment

0,"I'm so sad because I really like this bar  they have cool yummy drinks and its just easy and relaxed. But The service here was annoyingly slow. Our waitress was too involved in her coworkers to pay any mind to her customers. We finished our first drinks, the waitress walked by us a dozen times totally ignoring our empty glasses. Finally makes eye contact with me \""oh u ready?\"" No shit Sherlock. Finally got our second round, again the drinks r Delish but by this time I was too annoyed to enjoy it. Then she finally sees were done again, we ask for our bill and wait another 10-15 mins. I'm pissed now so I got up and asked her about it, Apparently it takes the bartender 20 mins to discount a bill with a coupon the hotel gave me!! wtf?! After 4 miserable days in Vegas of nothing going right all I wanted was to enjoy my fav spot and home girl killed it!"
0,"I've officially sworn off buffets; I was leaning in that direction to begin with, but our experience at Le Village Buffet sealed the deal.\n\nThe buffets in Vegas have been heading in the same direction over the past five years - more expensive, while less quality. I've seen this happen at Rio, Wynn and now Paris. I lived in Vegas for three years and worked as a supervisor in one of the largest casinos there; as a frequent visitor to buffets, I can say this isn't simply speculation; it's what's gone down.\n\nLe Buffet when it opened, was one of the finest in Vegas; a fantastic assortment of food stations, incredible service and desserts to die for. When we returned to this buffet in January, I was so disappointed, I felt sick all night that we'd payed about $70 for two of us to eat here.\n\nThe buffet caters primarily toward seafood now, which is great if you're a seafood lover; I am not. There were very few options that were appealing for non-seafood fans. There is a generous mountain of shrimp to mine from and there are crab legs; I do like shellfish. However, whenever the crab legs are put out, unless you're camping there, you're going to get completely raped by the pushy folks that get there before you and blast through the pile, diligently picking it clean of the good legs, leaving the spoils to everyone else. It was frustrating and annoying as hell.\n\nThe food selections I did have were okay - but definitely not worth $30 or so per person. The dessert station was a disaster; names of desserts did NOT match what was out. Obviously, the staff here doesn't care. It was a \""try your luck\"" situation and patrons were left to guess what treat they were actually getting.\n\nAt one station, I couldn't separate two bowls, and I passed them toward a staff member on the other side of the counter, telling her they were stuck. She looked at me like I was an idiot and slammed the bowls on the granite counter, which made them separate. She gave me one, and started putting the other BACK INTO THE CLEAN BOWLS PILE, after I'd explained to her that I gave them to her because my hands were all over them. A woman standing next to me spoke right up and asked the staffer what she was thinking; that I'd JUST told her I was touching the bowls! The staff member frowned at the other customer and removed the bowl from the stack. Totally disgusting; makes you wonder what else ends up in the clean plates stacks there.\n\nTable clearing was slow and finding someone to refill our soda was a joke. Total contrast to when this buffet was new and it seemed that there were several bussers for each table that were on you like vultures the minute you cleaned your plate or put an empty glass on the table. Not the case anymore, sadly, and that added to my frustration.\n\nStanding in line for another station, the final straw broke this camel's back - a woman stood in front of me eating food off of her plate and SUCKING her fingers. Then, you guessed it, she went right on using that hand to use tongs and spoons getting more food from the buffet.\n\nAnd really, that's the core problem with ANY buffet. People are disgusting. They are piggish and pushy and dirty. You can somewhat control the level of a dining experience, but you can never completely control the other customers. Case in point, The Wicked Spoon at Cosmopolitan - considered to be the best buffet in Vegas now by many. We ate there and the experience was okay - except for the two tables close to us with loud, drunk douchebag guests being SO loud that it disrupted everyone's experience.\n\nSo the next time you consider shelling out the better part of $100 on a Vegas buffet, remember what you're paying for - crowds of strangers pawing at the same spoons and tongs, breathing and coughing over the same food stations and a wait staff that is there making just over minimum wage that honestly won't give a rat's ass if you ever return or not. It's Vegas, and the people will come pretty much no matter what.\n\nFor the foreseeable future, I am DONE with buffets."
1,Mac's is walking distance from.our place so we frequent it. The food is pretty good and a wide beer selection with different weekly specials. Outside seating is fun if the weather isn't too hot. It can get pretty packed so sometimes there is a wait.\n\nThe food always comes out very quickly. Reasonable prices. Good bbq but maybe not as good as Midwood Smokehouse.
1,"Excellent service - on time, worked hard, very careful, took some furniture apart to move and put it back together. Would definitely hire for our next move. Highly recommend!! Painless and smooth!"
0,"I've been here several times and have been disappointed each time. The service is good, the atmosphere lovely but the food is below average especially when you consider the price."
1,Absolutely gorgeous place.
0,"This show was a bit cheap for me. For the price that people would pay for, I'm not too sure that it's worth it. It pretty much dragged on after 30 minutes in. Clair Sinclair isn't really talent of the night. I think they should give more props to the dancers and singer because they made the show happen. Every once in a while Sinclair would strut herself with a little tease though. It was just not what I expected."
0,"Blah. I was just unimpressed, even worse, I did not really like the food, even left it unfinished. The staff was very nice, and it probably would have gotten one star if not for that. Maybe I went on an off day, regardless I will not be going back."
0,"RUN IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION RATHER THAN GET INTO A NELLIS TAXI. Especially operator 585-middle aged white male.  After spending a memorable three day stay at Mandalay Bay-2 or 3 blocks from the airport, we stepped into a Nellis taxi. The first clue was he headed North up the strip, Mandalay is at the South end and we only needed to go East about two blocks. He said that he didn't know the street by the Tropicana was closed and he had to travel to the end of the strip. We explained that our flight was leaving at 6 am and we needed to be at Terminal 3 for United by 5:15am. He picked us up at 4:45am. He circled through Terminal 1 twice, pulling up behind cars that were unloading. Again, we explained that we had only minutes to get to Terminal 3 and to get into the far left lane to pass through Terminal 1. We had to get out and ask someone at luggage check in to find out where Terminal 3 was. At this point we sat behind the driver rather than the back of the van so we could  read the traffic signs. On the third pass he bypassed the Terminal 3 sign and we were leaving the grounds of the airport. We asked why are you doing this to us. We didn't offend him... we were going to miss our flight. He said that he was going to turn off his meter, but he didn't.  Finally, I saw a sign that said take a left to rental car drop off. I said to take us there because a shuttle could get us to the airport. Again, instead of making the turn to the rental car drop off he went straight down a deserted road. Now, I am not one to drop the F bomb especially directing it to someone but clearly OPERATOR 585 was effen us. Not only was he racking up charges we were going to miss our flight back to the East Coast. After screaming and demanding that he back up and make the turn to the  rental car depot he did so. Security came over and we explained what he did to us. At this point it was 5:30am, we knew that we had to call the police but we needed to make this flight. OPERATOR 585 was going to pull away with our luggage still in his cab. We got our luggage and got into another cab. We arrived at 5:40 am to the airport. The United staff assisted us through the airport and we made our flight. When we made it home I called Nellis and spoke to Dave. He explained that the driver was new. REALLY. I am not from Las Vegas and could read traffic signs and could have made it to Terminal 3. He asked if we paid the driver. We did, we threw $20. on the ground. Dave said that's good because the driver will have to make up the difference. ARE YOU KIDDING ME??? That is not what I am looking for. I was told to call the transit authority and am pressing charges.  I called Mandalay Bay to forewarn them of our experience and protect their guests from stepping into this taxi. Hopefully I will meet others that care enough and will help me stop Operator 585 Nellis Taxi from picking up any customers"
0,Huge line to pick up a car even though I made a reservation :-(
1,"Great service, delicious food! The meat tastes extremely fresh!! I suggest this place in a heartbeat!"
0,Not open on Sunday despite the Yelp profile saying otherwise. Thanks for the waste of time.
1,"Awesome tapas, Amazing service, excellent overall experience. \n\nThis was our first time here so we decided to try a few different items, all of which were excellent. \nParmesan fries with chipotle aioli was a simple but good accompaniment to the duck tacos, shrimp & crab dip, and our garlic chicken pizza. \nThe standout facet of our visit was by far our server - Snoopy D. Yes, that's her name. At least that's what was on the receipt. She was so helpful and very attentive. When my wife couldn't decide between the hummus and shrimp and crab dip she told us she'd surprise us. When she brought out the dip she ended up bringing us a full size shrimp dip AND some hummus. The hummus free of charge! This was an excellent surprise but it didn't stop there. After we were finished she offered us The Messy Sundae; we respectively declined. On her next stop, she dropped off The Messy Sundae and said \""I don't listen very well\"". Again this was free of charge! Needless to say we will be back again!"
1,"Visited on a Friday night, Dec 26, 2014.\n\nThis is an upscale spot, with a live jazz band that wasn't so loud you couldn't hold a conversation (we were seated at the bar).  The bartender was friendly, and made my buddy one happy camper with the suggestion of visiting Top Shelf to purchase the rum he was looking for.\n\nThis is a spot to take a date for an intimate conversation, where the drinks are priced to keep the riff-raff out.\n\nI've actually been here for High Tea too, which was enjoyable.  My biggest complaint is that they are going for a tranquil atmosphere, but what barely constitutes a wall-divider separates the lounge from the front desk... so a lot of foot traffic is a bit distracting.  Good for a place to see and be seen, but not ideal for tea."
1,"I came here the other night for their anniversary special. 50% off their squid ink pasta and 50% off their Uni Tomato Cream Pasta. My friend and I ordered one of each plus their their shabu shabu salad. Once we ordered, the food came out really quickly or my friend and I were enjoying each other's company. The salad was pretty big for 2 people to share. It had leafy lettuce pieces along with thinly sliced shabu shabu meat. It was pretty good except for the abundant amount of onions. The squid ink pasta was just okay. It made my mouth really black, and I didn't like that I had to keep wiping my mouth off. There wasn't much taste to it. I did really enjoy the uni cream pasta. I normally don't like uni, but you can't taste it. It was very creamy and very delicious. The servers are very fast at working, clearing my plate, refilling water. \n\nToo bad the uni pasta is normally $26. Otherwise, I'd totally get it more often!"
1,"Well, most people that have used first impressions on Yelp are NOT accurate.  I was really happy with the service I received from them. I just did an addition and they were able to come out and get things done in a timely manner.  They have a large variety and I would recommend them."
1,This is a really nice salon! Their equipment is top notch. Even their lowest level beds have the high pressure face lamps. I have used the level 2 beds only a few times and already got a great base tan. Plus the bed has a jack for my iPhone so I can listen to my own music if I want. I did try out the upper level Prestige bed the other day. Wow. That bed is AMAZING. It instantly gave me that dark bronze color. The owner is really nice and they do those little extra things like greeting you by name when you walk in the door and offering you a free bottled water when you leave. I'm so glad i decided to check this place out!
1,Showed up on time and did an excellent job.  JJ was very reasonably priced and very respectful and even helped me move a few things.  I highly recommend
0,"I live close to Oregano's, and our family always wanted to try this place out. \nWhat a better occasion than trying it for my 21st wedding anniversary. It was very packed, so we had the impression it was going to be phenomenal food. We sat outside, and we immediately fell in love with the environment. We sit there for 20 minutes and we order some drinks. Our service was nothing spectacular, and the server fail to suggest any options. We ordered the Big Rig Pasta; a very dry pasta with no flavor whatsoever. My daughter ordered Lady is A Scampi, very dry pasta as well not worth the money. Furthermore, Alfredo the Dark was dry pasta, little sauce topped with tomato.  In addition, the wings were extremely salty. The pizza was good. The only thing we loved was the dessert! Never coming back, I'd rather stick to the regular Olive Garden or Malee's on Main."
1,I loooove their chicken shwarma pita. Good quick service during lunch time and friendly wait staff.
1,"Friendly staff, love everyone but Sam was super helpful today! James is epic at nail art and French tips- highly recommend!"
1,"The pho hit me at the right spot after an insane hangover. Also they definitely challenged me with the size of that bubble tea. One problem though, what is up with that tapioca? Either they are not boiling it right or just getting the wrong brand. But with everything else, I am quite satisfied."
0,"This is my second time at the Cracked Egg (Henderson Location) and the first time all I could remember was the fact that the food was delicious; hence my desire to make a return trip.\n\nWalking in to the restaurant with my mom we were greeted by the cashier and told the wait would be 5 minutes; no problem. When my name was shouted (as if there was a fire mind you), the \""hostess\"" snatched the silverware and menus and raced off to the table.  She did not so much as look back to see if we were following her, nor did she even say anything to us as we were seating ourselves. Why? Oh yeah, that's because she was already back at the hostess stand before we even pulled our own chairs out.\n\nThis atrocious moment in customer service left an extremely sour taste in my mouth prior to even being helped by our server; who's service was also sub par.\n\nThankfully the food was the only redeeming quality and the friendly cashier guy. \n\nI thoroughly enjoy the eats at the Cracked egg however we will not be returning to this location again."
0,"My assumption is that this place is supported exclusively by dog lovers.  It sure can't be the food.  I came here for lunch and got a pizza and salad combo. \n\nThe pizza was bland but tolerable (the old \""pizza is like sex\"" joke is apt).  However, the salad made me feel like I had teleported back to Iowa in 1973.  They use ONLY iceberg lettuce on their salad.  What sort of restaurant does that in this day and age?  I thought maybe that it was just the side salad that was this way, but a coworker got a \""Fajita Salad\"", and it was also just iceberg.  The fajita salad appears to basically be iceberg and cheap-looking grated cheddar.  It also had a side of chicken and grilled peppers and onions, but those looked rather sparse.\n\nThe atmosphere is a bit too Disney-ish (read: juvenile) to make this a good bar to drink at, and the food is pretty mediocre.  Again, I have to assume that people who are obsessive dog lovers cannot resist coming here because there are so many adorable dog photos on the walls.  I, however, am just a dog liker.  Therefore, I can and will resist Uncle Bears."
1,"Straight out of a Tarantino movie. I heart this place. My only problem is their ventilation sucks  so you reek of cigs when you leave, but it's a small price to pay. Their drinks seriously sneak up on you, beware..."
1,"Amazing little place. Delicious food, prepared with care, a great mix of flavors in every bite. You can taste the freshness of the herbs, spices and vegetables. \n\nHighlights: rotisserie chicken, grilled fish, salad with chicken a la brasa, sweet plantains, yucca fries, fresh juices (papaya, pineapple, mango, strawberry!). The dipping sauces knock it all out of the park. \n\nIt's almost miraculous that you can feed a family of four a healthy, made-to-order meal of tasty grilled meats served with fresh fruits and vegetables at such a reasonable price. After living in the Twin Cities for a decade, a place like this would always be packed and over-priced. The brasa concept is popular - because it's so tasty and leaves you feeling GOOD. \n\nThis place is a gem and a favorite."
0,"I'm starting to feel like I only write bad reviews... I'll have to fix that.\n\nI'm not a fan.\n\nThe food was ok, but not great - and at those prices it's really not worth it.\n\nWe started with Tom Kha soup and the Roti appetizer.  The soup was okay but really under-spiced and unusually sweet for what I'm used to with this soup.  The Roti was really greasy and the dipping sauce was a kind of bland satay.\n\nI had sushi as my entree and got their version of a  fantasy roll. The roll was cut way too big so that you kind of had to break it up into pieces or shove the whole thing in your mouth in a really ugly way.  Pretty hard to taste anything either way.  The sushi was really fresh though.\n\nMy date had the spicy thai duck and he really liked it. I'm not a huge fennel fan so I didn't like it much, but it seemed like it would be good for people who are.  The tomatoes that came alongside were nowhere close to being ripe.\n\nThe place was really crowded and felt like a cafeteria. \n\nThe service was polite but about what you'd expect at a diner, they didn't know much about the menu and had wonderful Pittsburgh accents. Cute but not professional."
1,"One of my new favorites! The food is great; we've been there twice and service was awesome both times. Prices are also very reasonable, especially given the quality of the food.\n\nI had the miso ramen, my husband loved his oxtail curry. We also had a mango tuna roll (?) which was delish - the fish was really fresh. A bit too much garlic on the chili garlic edamame, but that was good as well.\n\nThe restaurant is a lot larger than it looks from the outside and is really nice inside. It looks like they have a private room. \n\nWould definitely recommend!"
0,"The place is clean and one of the nicest Asian restaurants I've been to with the huge solid tables and the environment is well done.\n\nValue of food is very bad.  Tried their $27 signature rice (pineapple fried rice) and $26 mongolian beef and some $13-15 vegetable dish.  At that price (3-4x what it normally costs), you'd expect something great, but it was worse than the average chinese restaurant's food.\n\nFood came out quick, but service lacked in general.  Water was never refilled and the way the order was taken felt like a mom/pop shop restaurant.\n\nI don't recommend."
1,"Great food, awesome price, and the owner has never forgotten an order he took.\n\nThe prices have gone up a little since they first opened, but it's still very cheap, especially considering the portion size. I especially love the hot sesame/chilli oil that they have but it's kind of a hit and miss, Not always made right"
1,"I was nervous about trying out this schizophrenic restaurant... what is it? A steak house? An italian place? A sushi restaurant? Tapas? HUH?  I thought  the sushi/continental/steak/italian concept was stupid and could never work... they proved me wrong!\n\nI went here for a work dinner. The place was packed on a Wednesday night (a good sign!). The views were incredible and the restaurant is incredibly well designed. It's a huge place, but honestly every seat has a great view. Watching the sunset and seeing the lights come on on the strip was awesome from their vantage point . Loved it. Service was also divine. Now on to the important stuff... the food..\n\nSushi: I was blown away by the freshness of their fish. I expected crap, but was pleansantly surprised. Not fishy.. not mushy.. just awesome. They had a surf & turf roll on special. Spicy tuna covered in seared kobe steak. Awesome!! \n\nAppetizers/tapas/\""sharing plates\"": We only tried the kobe sliders. I've had so many awesome sliders in this town, that I can say these were great, but I honestly prefer the ones at Hanks better. However, they were served with amazing shoestring sweet potato fries..! I'd order them again for sure. \n\n\""Large plates\"": I ordered the black truffle chicken breast. The sauce.. the chicken... it was all perfection! I sampled my coworker's ribeye.. tender, well prepared, and tasty. Mac and cheese was creamy, but not too heavy.\n\nDesserts: The little mini donuts were kinda a disappointment to be honest.. skip those!\n\nPrice: A great value!! With entrees ranging from $19-$35 it's quite \""reasonable\"" for Vegas. Sashimi was $6-$9 for 3 pieces, sushi rolls were in the $7-$15 range, Chimay was $6/bottle, etc. Hardly cheap, but when you're looking to splurge you definitely get a good value for your money here!!"
0,"NEVER AGAIN....\n\nMy husband and I have used Gray Line as a package deal with our Allegiant airline ticket several times now. Each time, we ended up stuck somewhere wondering how we were going to get from A to B. \n\nThis time was the last straw. Our flight was at 2:00pm, so we called 24 hours in advance and they told us to wait at the shuttle station at 11:30. Well, we wait and NOTHING. Mind you, it is cold, windy and a little sprinkly (but mostly horrible winds). We see plenty of Gray Line shuttles doing drop-offs, but no one comes to pick us up. Not to mention, we saw a TON of Showtime, CLS and Bell shuttles - making mental notes to use them next time. \n\nApproximately 11:55, I finally called Gray Line and, after 3 times of calling and being put on hold for what seemed like an eternity, I finally get an answer from someone named Gloria at about 12:15. She claims that a driver already came. He did not! \n\nSo then Gloria says that we can either wait for the 12:30 shuttle, which would get to the airport at 1pm but they couldn't guarantee we would get on our flight by 2pm --- or, we could just take a cab to be safe. Really? How about we could've caught a cab from the get-go and not wasted our time with your company????\n\nNeedless to say, Gloria was not sympathetic, not helpful and really could care less about our situation. She said there was no way for them to reimburse us for the cab, but that we could mail a complaint to their refund office and receive a refund within 30 days. I asked for a supervisor, and Gloria said \""there's no supervisor here right now.\"" Wow.... \n\nBy now, it's 12:24pm. We ended up catching the 12:30 shuttle and running for our life to finally get to our gate in time for the 1:30 boarding. We were hungry, tired and officially done with Gray Line shuttle services once and for all. \n\nLooking through all of these reviews, I see that the old \""The driver already came\"" line is used often. What a shame! Gray Line has horrible customer service and just plain horrible service, period."
0,Like the other person said....Pure Crap....The music wasn't that great. It was packed and if your in heels forget about a place sit down. Over priced drinks that we not strong. we left before it even hit midnight and hit up another club. I'm glad we got  in for free. I wouldn't pay to go in that club again.
1,"I loved it here. My friends and I stayed at the Imperial Palace for 4 nights earlier this month. We arrived at the hotel around 9pm so as expected there was a 45 min wait to check in. No big deal. When it was finally our turn the concierge who checked us in was very nice. She was able to accommodate our request to have our rooms right next door to each other. The only thing that caught me off guard was the $40 per room per night hold they said they had to put on a credit card for security purposes. I didn't really appreciate not being informed about this sooner. Since I was the only one of us traveling that had brought credit cards I ended up having to put these $300+ holds on to one of mine. Still ok, but seriously if I hadn't brought my credit cards I don't know what we would have done.\nOnto the rooms, very basic. Clean,  2 double beds, not great lighting, like 4 tv channels... but still exactly what I expected from reading the reviews. I knew we weren't staying at the nicest place in Vegas. But since we were rarely in our room it didn't matter to me at all. My biggest complaint about the room was NO CLOCK RADIO! Doesn't everyone like to listen to music while getting ready?? My roomie and I solved this by singing the entire time. While our rendition of  Don't Stop Believing was quite amazing  a radio/I pod dock would have been greatly appreciated.\nAs for the casino/rest of the hotel... yup, its old but I still thought it was awesome. Sure it's a little smoky but I didn't mind. The Dealertainers were great. Freddie Mercury was by far the most talented of the bunch! He was amazing! We all thought though that Elvis looked more appropriate for a Johnny Cash and seriously Mariah girl...dye your roots.\nYes, there are long waits for the elevator. But if you walk around some you can probably find more elevators like we did.  DO NOT TAKE THE STAIRCASE DOWN. Or at least make sure your on the correct one with access to the lobby. I couldn't find the correct one and the staircase I tried to use was locked on almost every floor. I ended up having to go up past my floor # just to get out of  it.\nOh another word of advice...beers in the little store in the hotel are $4 for 12oz!!! Hell no im not paying that! If you walk out of the back of the hotel, through the parking deck and to the right a bit you will hit a  little shopping center with a casino/store and Battistas in it. Booze is way cheaper at that store!!! Tall boys were $1.50. Hell yes! \nAll in all I would stay here again in a heartbeat. I loved the location, the cheesiness of the casino., and the overall kitschy vibe. Plus, there was a karaoke bar in the hotel only a short walk from our room. So for me and my friends this place was perfect. We had an amazing trip."
1,"The Mirage is a great place to stay on the strip.  You can't beat the location - with good access to walk to the Wynn, Bellagio, or across the street to the Venetian.  There are also good restaurant options on the property - Stack, the hamburger place and the Carnegie Deli are all great places to have a bite to eat.\n\nThe rooms here have been updated over the past two years and they are modern and well appointed.  The bed is also very good, firm and comfortable.\n\nKeep an eye on their website as there are typically several deals available that offer a very affordable price for your stay here.\n\nThe only downside for me is that the poker room isn't as popular or busy as it used to be.  I played mostly at the Venetian because of this..."
1,I love fat tuesday! Get the monster yard ... you just can't go wrong!
1,"Tony greeted me the second I walked in. I was in kind of a hurry you got two slices to me within 5 minutes and they were outstanding. Authentic corner shop feel, I highly recommend Casanova brothers pizza."
0,"This was my first and last experience at Wild Thaiger and I will not be going back. Ever. The service was unacceptable. From the moment my friend and I entered the restaurant the experience was bad. In hindsight, I should have walked out after our issues with the hostess. She repeatedly asked us where we would like to sit, or how many people were in our party, and then she would walk away while we answered or disregard that we had answered her at all. It was like she was incapable of absorbing information. We finally got seated. The table behind us very loudly cancelled their order paid for their drinks and left stating that the service taking too long. The writing was on the wall. At first, I felt like those people were incredibly rude, but now I wish that I had left too rather than enduring a total lack of service. \nIt took a long time for us to get water or our drinks. We ordered an appetizer at the same time as our drinks, the appetizer took 45 minutes to arrive, the waiter forgot that we had ordered anything at all, came back to the table to confirm the appetizer TWICE and still brought us the wrong item and then had the nerve to charge us for it! I asked for menu suggestions, the waiter just stared at me blankly. I asked if I could have steamed rice rather than fried, he said that was impossible to change. Impossible. Eventually our entrees came, I ordered soup, it wasn't good. He brought out a teacup for me to use as my soup bowl. It was almost impossible to manage. Then our check came, he overcharged us. I didn't dispute anything because I just wanted to leave. I paid in cash, he shorted me five dollars. I called that his tip, and left. \nThe restaurant was not busy, it was typical for a Wednesday night. There is no excuse for their wait times or rudeness. I found the menu to be limiting, and the items lacked enough description. I will never go back. I have no idea how it had such good reviews."
0,I thought I would really like this show but it was SO BORING I kept falling asleep. I felt like I was a parent forced to watch the school play cause I had some retarded kid in it.  We ended up leaving during the intermission.  We had excellent seats-section B row N  and got the tickets for free.  The costumes were neat and there were some cool set/scenes but  I would be upset if I had paid $440 ($110 each). I would rather watch the movie any day.
1,"Yay - I've always wanted to eat in the Tree restaurant inside City Center! :D\n\nUnfortunately, we were not actually seated inside the tree, but tis okay! Our group of 5 (3 other girls were too drunk to make it, but anyhows), was seated near the door. Hint - if you are seated along the wall, make sure you sit in the booth with the white plush walls. Awesome to lean your head against!\n\nOur waitstaff was superb, although I was a bit sad when they didn't offer any comp things for our meals taking so long! Womp. Also, our table was super dim, we could barely see each other.\n\nAs a party of 5 girls (and our first and only meal of the day), we had:\n\n* Seafood tower w/ oysters, claws, jumbo shrimp, crab. Uhhmaaayyyzing. Get this. Pick whatever you want. I'd go without the oysters as they clocked in about $5/each and were not mind blowing. DEFINITELY get the jumbo shrimp - they were huge and already peeled! There are few things better than that in the world.\n\n* Alaskan king crab black truffle gnocci. UMMMM I am OBSESSED w. this dish. So buttery, so creamy, so YUMMY! I could not stop gobbling this ish up. \n\n* Lobster Mashed Potatoes - nomnomnom! Had huge chunks of fresh luscious lobster nestled within the creamy mashed potatoes. Fan! \n\n* The special 32oz kobe steak, cooked medium rare. This was perfection. $98 worth of absolute perfection. The steak was a perfect pink and melted in my mouth. The leftovers even tasted amazing. \n\n* Chilean Sea Bass, blackened per our waiter's recco. Unfortunately, I didn't love this dish....so i don't really have much to say about it. I think it had more to do with the way it was prepared (I generally don't have my fish blackened) than the fish itself - but not impressed.\n\nTwo girls split a bottle of red vino for just $33 - surprisingly priced at such a nice resto.\n\nAt the end, our bill came out to just about $100 pp. Pricey - definitely, but I think it's worth it! Make sure to request a tree house table!\n\nOh - at the end of the meal, our waiter gave us to-go sippy cups for the rest of our vino! He also jokingly asked if my drunkie friend would also like a cup of agua to go ;) puuahaha"
1,"Thai Spice has been a favorite of mine since 1994. I was a young mother and brought my first born in when she was 3 days old.  The owner was so sweet and loved my baby girl. Throughout the years we frequented the rest. for dinner and she always brought my daughter a small bowl of rice to keep her busy while we waited for food. Just fantastic customer service and kindness.\n As for the food...i love it! The chan ram is my go to appitizer as well as chicken satay. Tom kha kai soup is so good. the duck curry is delicious and good old sweet and sour chicken is the best in town. Thai tea is yummy too!\nI still enjoy driving across town to have a fantastic meal, I know what im getting and I know there will be no rude wait staff. Thai Spice Is still the best in las vegas in my opinion.\nEnjoy"
0,"When you pay PRIME prices you expect PRIME service and PRIME food. This was at least our fifth visit to PRIME and very likely our last.\n\nWe have celebrated birthdays and anniversaries at PRIME and on December 23, 2010 were looking for a quiet getaway and a splurge on dinner with perfect service as we had enjoyed in the past. We arrived at our reservation time. Our prior request for a table by the window was not honored but it was a nice table and we were happy when we were seated. In all past visits I would have given PRIME a five star rating. We ordered drinks and appetizers. We soon noticed that the highly attentive, though not imposing service we have come to love and expect at PRIME was not present. Drinks took over 10 minutes and bread took 20. The shrimp cocktail was amazing as usual, keeping in mind that 4 shrimp for $20 ought to be amazing. \n\nWe each ordered the Baby Iceberg Lettuce with Crispy Bacon & Maytag Bleu Cheese Dressing. This was served about 30 minutes into our visit. (By then my husband was ready for another drink and started trying to catch someone's eye to request one. Our waiter was occupied with the table of 5 seated next to us. Finally my husband asked someone else for another drink. It took at least 15-20 more minutes for the drink to arrive and the person who brought it was not our waiter and not until after we had complained to the manager.) For $18 each you might expect some interesting salad presentation. I enjoyed eating the salad but not the fact that I had to cut the lettuce myself. It looked like they had just cut a center slice of the baby lettuce head and plopped it on a plate. My husband thought the salad was too rich as there were blue cheese chunks and heavy blue cheese dressing along with very thick bacon. \n\nFor the main course we each ordered the small filet mignon $44 for 8oz. These don't come with any side dishes so we also ordered sides of potatoes and mushrooms to share. We had been there about an hour by now and my drink was empty, our waters were empty and our waiter was now taking an order at a third table. I asked a staff member passing by if I could please speak to a manager. The General Manager came right to our table. I told her we were sad that the service was so poor and that our waiter seemed not to have time for us. My husband still did not have the second drink. The Manager was extremely polite and said she was very sorry and that she would take care of things. This did get things going -- though we did not like to have to complain to get decent service. My husband's second drink came a minute after she walked away. Then the filet were served but again not by our waiter. I suspect they had been sitting \""up\"" for a while. The filet were cold to the touch but each had two small charred green chili peppers sizzling next to them. The charred pepper smell was overpowering to the point that it hit the sinus right as they lifted off the silver cover.  Within that same minute sides were delivered. We got the mushrooms but instead of potatoes, we got creamed spinach. \n\nThat was it. The dinner we had been looking forward to for months was ruined. Since neither of us like hot peppers or spinach, we decided to leave. I asked for the manager again and told her that we needed to leave as the wrong side and hot peppers along with the poor service had ruined our dinner. I asked her to please charge what we had eaten up to that point to our room, but she declined to do so. She was very empathetic and offered to reseat us and start over or send whatever we wanted back to our room. This was a kind offer but we were just not up for either as our experience was ruined. By then it was around 9pm and we were just tired of trying to beg for service in what is supposed to be a four star place. \n\nAfter many good dinners and fond memories of the exceptionally fine service, superior food and decor as well as the beautiful view of the fountains, I don't think we will go back. This awful experience has ruined it for us. Given that this hotel opened in 1998, we both wondered whether the waiters we had so very much enjoyed in prior visits had moved on to newer places or were just not working."
0,"My husband was in the hospital for blood clots in both of his legs and lungs. The Dr was extremely rude. My husband had told them he was in pain the Dr said \""that is not my problem, that is you problem. Im here just to make sure you follow-up with your primary.\"" When we asked questions she said Google it and ask your primary at your follow-up appointment."
1,"This place is popular! I always try to do a bit of research before visiting any city to find out what places are worth eating at. Since Yelp Canada had slim offerings, I found Pho Bang thanks to Vice's guide to Montreal. The place is fairly large and on a Wednesday night it was packed wall-to-wall with diners. We didn't have to wait too long for a table for two and the wait is definitely worth it.\n\nI've had some great pho in the States, but Pho Bang definitely topped many of the places I've been to. I had the pho tai and the bf got the pho with flank, brisket and tripe. I was a little disappointed by my beef but the broth was delicious! The bf loved his. The broth was well-flavored and not greasy which is a big plus with me. We also had shrimp spring rolls which were huge! The shrimp was fresh and cooked well. Service was quick and efficient and it was a pretty inexpensive meal. Highly recommended!"
0,"We walked out.  Never got to eat.  The waiter was to busy hitting on the 15 year old girls sitting behind us then come up and take our order.  We waited a good 15 minutes and no love.  \n\nNot to mention, the food looked over priced for what is was."
1,My local and the best. The staff are really friendly and even though it's busy you never have to wait long. And the food is super tasty. One of the reasons I love this area!
1,"Ate here after another mediocre \nmovie choice and it was so good, it saved the day. \nThe croation (owner?) was amazingly helpful and gracious. He talked with us and treated us like family. \nHe pulled a table outside so my dad and I could sit in the sun. Even gave us sweet dates at the end of our meal to \""finish with something sweet.\""\nSanwiched in between two chain resturants, it's easy to miss, but don't be swayed. Support the small business owner and check it out. The lentil soup is delicious and my father said the same for his sausage sandwich."
0,"We were a party of 5, aged 17 - 89 years old.  The restaurant is very pretty, and quiet (nice for the 89 year old), but none of us were wowed by the place.  The food was just OK - nothing spectacular.  For the price, we should have been wowed.  My starter, marrow bones, was my favorite part of the meal and it was delicious.  Unfortunately, I wanted a spoon (maybe even one of those tiny marrow bone spoons?) to scoop the marrow out to spread on the bread, but our waiter was busy elsewhere.  I finally stopped a different server, asked for a spoon, and received another knife and fork.  Sigh.  Now, it's two weeks later, and I don't even recall what we ate - just that no-one was delighted.  Like I said, nothing was bad.  It's just that for over $300 it should have been great."
1,Worth the wait! Get some Hop Knot next door and work up your appetite!
0,"Terrible! I purchased a groupon, but after all of the additional fees (upgrade to a higher level stylist because no one included in the groupon was available for a month, etc) I paid full price without full price service. If you make the mistake of going here, bring cash to tip your stylist. The receptionist cannot handle tips at all. They do offer a shady ATM that you can use and pay the surcharge, then put the tip in an envelope in a comment box. Haircut was ok, but certainly not near what I expected after reading the other reviews. I left extremely upset and no one cared. Terrible customer service!"
0,"Service was bad, we could tell that the food was not fresh and when we asked for fresh they acted as if it was a chore. Not happy with the service, but it was clean."
0,"DO NOT GO HERE IF YOU BLACK (:), All you will find here is minorities being racist to minorities;  Nick refused to cut my hair.   I went here because by the recommendation of another posted review.   If you cannot cut a regular (guard 1 )fade on a black guy you should not be cutting hair.  End of story and shame on the owners for allowing this.\n\n\nIn the alternative, I would recommend \""Nappy by Nature\"" on Bethany Home Road or if you're at Baller status and you only want to make an appointment (because you like to jump right in the chair) I would go to \""the Art of Shaving\"" at fashion square mall.  Barbers in both locations know how to cut all types of hair."
1,"The amount of food is about 40% less than the ceasars palace buffet, but the food they have is just as good if not Better. This place is located on floor two of the cosmopolitan hotel next to the bellegio. The dessert is 5 stars by itself ."
1,"Great place. I've never been to a legit barbershop before so I was confused with couple of things. Carol, my barber, gave me gentle instructions on what she's doing to my hair and how long I would be.\n\nCarol was a super nice lady and she gave me the best haircut of my life. It only took around 7-8 min and there was absolutely no problem with my hair. Love this place, and next time I'm in Vegas I'm coming back to this place without a doubt.\n\nFYI, for fellow Koreans, she's Korean also. She's a fluent Korean speaker so don't say anything foul in Korean. JK."
0,"If I could give this place ZERO stars, I would. There was no line or cover and I now know why. I was out with a group of girlfriends for a girls weekend and wanted to find fun nightlife. Landed at this place and AWEFUL doesn't begin to describe it. They bump loud dance music with no dance floor and have incredibly rude staff. Waited 20 minutes at the bar to be passed up for drinks by the same bartenders multiple times with no acknowledgement. When I stepped in to flag down the bartender after waiting for so long, she gave me a rude glance and continued to pass me and others by. Extremely disappointed - spend your time and money elsewhere and save yourself the trouble!!"
1,"Service great,  decor a step above the Valley norm and presentation make this one of the best all round Thai meals I've had in the region. \n\nThai hot? Sorry but Touch of Thai and The Thai house  in the north  and the north west of Phoenix respectively equal them and I had stressed me craving/ need/ addiction to experience such. I.E.,That's why I was at a Thai place to begin with since Indian eateries appear to have conceded their heat advantage to pander to local tastes.\n\n. It tasted really good though and only decorum , and a wife that would have stabbed me for doing this, prevented me from licking out the bowl:)\n\n The ginger dish that my partner had was very very  light in the ginger department but was pretty good otherwise and everything was as fresh as I've seen within the valley.\n\nSo is it worth a 30 mile drive on a regular basis? Not based on this single experience but it's good enough to  my Thai go to when in the region."
0,"Taking its name from the most famous of land marks whose shadow it sits in, Il Castello is a dissapointment from the moment you walk in.\n\nDespite being recently redecorated, the outside still seems shabby, and already the place is starting to look as though it could do with a lick of paint on the inside. As we arrived we were greeted by a surly waiter who communicated soley in grunts, and then promptly forgot about us. It took almost 20 mins to get a seat in a deserted restaurant.\n\nThe menu is huge, so there is little chance of finding something you dislike - but the food itself was on the tasteless side despite being well priced.\n\nOverall, Il Castello wont be somewhere I will be frequenting."

0,"My second time seeing KA was nothing like my first!\n\nI first saw this show with my girlfriends back in 2010 and fell in love with it. So much so that I decided to go again with my boyfriend this year. \n\nWell, while KA still has the same plot and theater, the show has changed for the worse. \n\nBoth my partner and I agreed that the show felt overproduced.  Lots of fillers and not enough acrobatics. I was very disappointed by the lack of tricks. How many friggin' times do we have to watch the tumble?! I seriously caught myself dozing off out of boredom on multiple occasions and THAT SHOULD NOT happen when you are watching a world renowned cirque!\n\n220$ later, we wished we had watched the \""O\"" instead."
1,"Been a little while since the last sushi exploration.\n\nThis place wasn't too far from home and had great reviews, so it was a no brainer.\n\nAppetizers: Baby Octupus Skewer, Bacon Scallop Skewer, Tuna Poke, Mushroom boy, and Crispy Rice with Spicy Tuna.\n\nAll delicious. Highly suggest them all.\n\nMushroom boy is a deep fried mushroom filled with cream cheese and spicy tuna. No further explanation necessary.\n\nOn to the rolls.....\n\nPhilly Roll, Hawaiian Roll, Chicken Teriyaki Roll, and Vegas Lasagna.\n\nNormally, there'd be another roll and 2-3 nigiri orders but. We tapped out. Today our bellies could not withstand AYCE as usual. But it's all good. We'll be back for sure to try everything else we missed!!\n\nThe service was very quick and on cue. Always ready to serve you and refill your drinks and take your plates.\n\nAmbiance is laid back and cool. Love the bar and how big it is. Plenty of space for the 96 rolls you're gonna order.\n\nThey have some amazing sauces on their stuff, and just enough.\n\nThey have the news and sports on while playing top 40/EDM\n\nNot my #1 place, but it's a great sushi option. And REALLY good for groups."
1,"so far, this is the best vietnamese food i have had in charlotte. my sister introduced me to this place. \ninitially, we had problems finding it again since it is in a rather obscure strip of south blvd. \nthe food is freaking delicious! i got the \""make your own\"" spring rolls. my sister showed me how to do them and then the waitress came back to show me how but i had already figured it out. plenty of food for the money but i wished they would have given me more herbs. i am sure i could have asked for more and next time, i will. \nthe ambiance was ok. pretty standard vietnamese place. one of the tables had a crying baby but i can't really blame the restaurant for that. \nfriendly staff, lots of parking, good prices, and lots of healthy options for food. \ni will be back!"
1,"Stopped by here during our first night in Vegas. It was sufficiently cheaper than the other locales nearby (The Capital Grille, etc). Both the fiancee and I got the Bacon Burgers, an order of fries and chocolate milkshakes.\n\nThe burgers were good. Cooked a bit much, but the toppings were fresh, and it was served quickly. The fries were superb, cooked to perfection, and just all around delicious. The milkshake was by and far the highlight of the meal. I HIGHLY recommend the chocolate milkshake here, it's among the best I've had, and easily worth the $5 price tag, especially on a hot Vegas day.\n\nThe service overall was good. It took forever for our waitress to show up initially, but after that she quickly refilled our waters before we were even finished, and quickly took care of the check. All and all, a very positive experience, and while a bit pricey for a burger and shake, it's location and great tasting shake make up for it."
1,"If you're looking for great Chicago-style pizza, Rosati's is the place to go.  As a new Las Vegas resident, it's been my task to find decent pizza and Rosati's brings the flavor and quality of those small Chicagoland pizzarias to the Las Vegas area.  Delivery service usually takes an hour, but the hour is well worth it as pizzas are delivered hot and well-made.  The buffalo wings are delicious and mozzarella sticks are good.  \n\nRosati's thin-crust pizza is delicious and exactly as it's made in Chicago.  The cheese is delicious and the italian sausage is flavorful and slightly spicy.  \n\nRosati's deep-dish is great with chunks of tomato in the sauce.\n\nTheir pan pizza is very similar to Chicago-style pans.  My only complaint is that the crust could use some additional flavor, maybe a more buttery consistency. \n\nOverall, I've used this Rosati's for delivery 32 times since I discovered it in March 2011.  Excellent food quality and fair delivery times."
1,Tasty coffees made with care. Food like it was made at home. A nice alternative to chain coffee joints.
1,"we really loved this place. Popped in on a saturday for lunch - pretty empty. Loved the decor and the staff was friendly (I see in other reviews this has been an issue). I ordered a pannini sandwich with mozzarella, basil and tomato and got the onion rings. all excellent - especially the onion rings. Husband ordered a burger - forget which one - but he said it was excellent. We were bother really happy with the meal and will head back again."
0,"Crap, crap, and major crap!  How this place is still in business puzzles me.  I live in SoCal so we know how the original Sam Woo taste like.\n\nAlways crowded here.  I don't know why but it is.  Probably because they think Sam Woo is the best bet for Chinese food.  WRONG.  Hostess has a nasty attitude with an ugly smug that I would like to wipe off.\n\nFood is extremely short of bad.  C'mon! They give you all the reject meat for full price.  Shady.\n\nService is laughable! So stupid.  How can they expect good tips with an attitude like that?\n\nThe last straw was when we went up to pay the bill and the girl said we could leave the tip with her.  My mom tipped only $2 because they didn't do s**t ( I didn't think they deserved a dime) and that b**** had the nerve to sneer \""that's not even 15%!\"" and gave us a nasty look.  She's lucky I let her have her hair still intact the way she was treating us.  I would have loved to give her a good beat down.\n\n0 stars! Why can't I give this place 0 stars?! I hope this place burns down to the ground."
0,"Besides bad food at Planet Dailies, I enjoyed my stay at PH last time. That was why I suggested my family to stay there this time. However, it was a disappointment. Was it because of spring break and the crowd? The bath tub in our room was not clean. My sister saw floating grey particles before she entered the tub. Yeah, that was gross. I asked house keeping to clean the tub but apparently the person who answered the phone did not understand the word \""tub\"". I repeated 5 time \""Please send someone to clean the bath tub\"" and all I got was \""what?\"" REALLY?"
0,"I don't mind prix-fixe menus; in fact, I often enjoy them. But, for a Vegas lunch with a few nonsensical items available for the courses...not so much. \n\nFirst and foremost, lunch, whether it be prix-fixe or not, should not take 2 hours to complete. Our server was very kind, but seemed a little confused by certain requests like extra tzatziki sauce. Maybe his confusion stems from the ocean-themed d\u00e9cor and fresh seafood on display when he's actually serving Mediterranean cuisine. But, I digress. \n\nThe food itself was...good; just that and nothing more. Certainly not my favorite Las Vegas or even Cosmopolitan dining option, and admittedly reflected in this review's low rating. The calamari was quite tasty, and the waiter was oddly a bit upset that we were too stuffed to finish the plate. Also, the lobster pasta comes with a moving (dead but still-moving) lobster on your plate with eyes still bulging, sadly staring back at you. I think my friend almost had a panic attack when it was placed in front of her. We love our lobster, but not when it's looking straight at you struggling to hang on to life. And yet, the bewilderment continued when she asked the bus boy to remove it off her plate. \n\nSo much confusion. Just...so much. Do yourself a favor and find lunch elsewhere."
1,"I was so pleased with the service that we received on a recent visit to Chili's.  \n\nWe often go get an afternoon snack of appetizers when we're out and about.  Hands down, one of our new favorite places to go is Chili's for their bottomless chips and salsa.  Order a couple of drinks and we're set for an afternoon snack.  Server was so friendly!  Honestly, it's been a while since we've had such great customer service!  He was all smiles while he brought us basket after basket of chips.  We actually joked about feeling bad that it was so cheap and that we ate so many chips.  His response, \""I'll bring you as many baskets of chips as you want!  That's what I'm here for!\""  \n\nOh, and the chips and salsa are so good!  Totally unexpected for a large chain restaurant.  Fresh chips made in house and yummy salsa......it's actually kind of pathetic that we thought that the salsa was better than what is served in MANY of the Mexian food restaurants around town.  Salsa should never be an afterthougt.....\n\nThanks for surprising us Chili's!"
0,"I ordered 2 dishes.\n\nGreen Curry Chicken - tasted okay, quality of food was good.  overall good, but i didn't like how expensive it was.  maybe its because there aren't many thai restaurants that they can charge a lot, but i've had much better elsewhere for much cheaper.\n\nBasil Beef - I've never had basil beef that was served with ground beef!  I usually get pieces/slices of beef, but this place served it with ground beef.  after i realized it was ground beef, i had only a little bit since it didn't taste all that good.\n\nadvice: don't order beef dishes, go with the chicken."
0,"If I can give 0 stars, I would in a heart beat!\n\nIt's been ONE week after I contacted them and still received nothing. Their phone lines are busy and doesn't even give you a option to hold until the next available representative. Their manager Julie said it'll get to me by Friday. Well guess what? It's Saturday and still NOTHING. I requested for a full refund and taking my business elsewhere. \n\nTHIS BUSINESS IS BOGUS, LIES, FALSE PROMISES, AND HAS BAD BUSINESS PRACTICE"
0,I ate at the restaurant but the selection was a little disappointing and tasted pretty generic. Beer was excellent though.
0,"I am a huge fan of the Chipotle brand and food. This negative review is for the service I received this afternoon at this location.\n\nEarliest pickup time available when we submitted our online order was 1:15pm. We arrived 15 minutes early, was told that our order was not ready and would be about 10 minutes. We tried to pay when there wasn't a line of customers and were told that we could not pay until our order was fulfilled. The girl in charge of the pickup orders came out and told us it would be another 10 minutes. She came out with our order at 1:15pm on the dot, and told us in an exasperated tone to call next time if we would be arriving early. Her attitude was terrible, as if we were a HUGE inconvenience and had rushed her (which, obviously, we hadn't since our order came out right on time...). A simple, \""Sorry for the wait, I was backed up on other orders and couldn't get this out earlier for you\"" would've sufficed. \n\nWhat's even BETTER is that when we mentioned pick-up-girl's attitude, the manager followed up with the same answer, \""next time call ahead if you'll be arriving early\"" without so much as a hint of apology. Clearly WE were in the wrong here. It was definitely a missed opportunity on the manager's part to turn the situation around and save our experience from being so disappointing. Coming from a background in retail and fast food, I was baffled by their self-righteous, unapologetic attitudes.\n\nI also didn't understand why 1. the manager was working in the fulfillment line the whole time and 2. there were periods of time when there were no customers to help - whey didn't someone (like, ahem, the manager) go and help the girl filling pickup orders?\n\nI've never had a bad experience at Chipotle before today, and will definitely never come back to this location."
0,"My husband and I went to Jim Gould to celebrate my birthday.  I ordered the Yellow Fin Tuna and could not eat it because it had a horrible smell/taste.  When I notified our waiter, he told me that he thought I might think that because others had felt similarly.  I ended up just sharing some of my husband's meal.  When our credit card statement came in, we reviewed it and noticed that Jim Gould had added an additional $18 to our bill.  We called Jim Gould to advise them and told them that we had the original receipt to prove it.  They said that a manager would call us back.  A few days later we still hadn't heard from a manager.  We have since called them numerous times and they will not return our phone calls.  They are crooks and I would like to warn others to compare your credit card statement to your receipt after dining at Jim Gould!"
1,"My first experience at this chain... I usually try to eat local when traveling but my partner wanted to eat here. The service was absolutely some of the best I have ever. Our server was Matt, he knew the menu forward and back and even offered us an appetizer that wasn't on the menu, blacked alligator, crazy good. The food was great as well, I ordered the Caribbean lobster tail, it was huge and very flavorful. We did have one mix up with the kitchen but Matt explained the situation and handled it. One of the best dining experiences ever. Check them out, and ask for Matt, you won't be disappointed."
0,"I'm so torn over the rating! The food was fantastic! I had the Cottage Pie, my husband had the Carne Adovado. Both were rich, tasty, and well-made, but the service was dismal! It took 10 minutes for our waitress to approach the table, which wasn't initially a problem but the service only went downhill from there. It took a half-hour to get our food, and our server never checked on drinks, we sat there with empty glasses and drinks with no ice, finally went to the bartender for refills. Again, the food was awesome! With my husband being a pastry chef we always want to try desserts and ordered the Bonaffee Pie and the Apple Pasty, after we ordered we waited...and waited...and waited, no sign of our server, finally waved down another server he checked and our desserts were right there! Again, our server nowhere to be seen, still empty glasses. After waiting for so long we weren't really interested in our desserts anymore unfortunately, then surprise! Suddenly our server was there with the bill!! After not seeing her for 40 minutes she drops the bill, doesn't offer boxes, no conversation, just drops the check. After we paid, she hovered at the next table which was empty and took the check before we were even completely out of our seat. \n    So TL;DR \n       For our first time here, food was excellent, but service was so bad we won't be back! I'll give the Tempe location a try, hopefully service will be better, but I won't go back to the Mesa location again."
0,"Went in here for a quick lunch with my family. The atmosphere and vibe was quite fun, but our food was rather disappointing. We ordered the ham and cheese crepe and croque monsieur, two simple dishes that are usually kept salty, only to have them both smothered in maple syrup. I don't know if this was Quebec twist to the dish, but I personally thought it ruined it. \n\nWe also had an order of cassoulet and it too was disappointing.\n\nThis small restaurant is essentially a tourist trap."
1,"went here for restaurant week and the service was amazing. They took a little longer than normal to serve our food so they gave us free dessert and appetizer. The food was good and this place looked like a little cabin, giving it a nice homey feel."
0,"Now I had a very bad experience with this groomer. Now the shop owner was sweet at first but in my opinion must have become jaded over her long standing years as pet groomer because when I heard my dog cry out from the back room and asked if it was her lori's answer was \""that falls under the category of oh well that's to bad it has to be done\"" I couldn't believe she said that to me but I kept silent I just knew my dog wasn't one to cry like that anyhow I'm going to make a very long story short and let y'all know that the result of that was my poor baby nails being clipped on one paw way to short so short that they were bleeding however I didn't know until I got home and rinsed her off to make sure she was hair free and the powder she had stopped the bleeding with came off. I'd wondered why my pup was acting so odd and scared. I called Lori and she admitted to the accidentally cutting her nails to short and I'm not one to be an ass but why wouldn't she tell me before I took my dog home where I have a very well taken care of white antique couch? Her unprofessional attitude and smart remarks not to mention very dirty waiting area taught me not to be so quick to trust just anyone with my pooch. The least she could have done was tell me what happened before going home or was it perhaps it was the $12 tip she was afraid id take back well I'll never know because I'll never return to have my dog done there again and I say you don't either. Sorry for dragging you through the mud Lori but in your own words \""that falls under the category of that to bad it has to be done\"""
1,"I'm not a vegetarian.  I was in the area and wanted Pho.  I was skeptical of the \""Vegetarian Pho\"" but decided to give it a try.  Not bad at all.  The broth was a little lighter (less flavorful) than traditional beef Pho, but that's to be expected if there's no beef.  The hoisin and sriracha served on the side helped a lot.  The soup was served with a nicely plated stack of cabbage, carrots, bean sprouts, a few sprigs of cilantro, and lime wedge.  I was a little disappointed at the lack of cilantro and basil.  The soup did contain tofu and some very interesting fake beef, which wasn't bad.  Overall, I enjoyed my lunch.\n\nService was excellent even though the place was very busy for lunch.  The other dishes I saw being served looked very good.  I'd be willing to come back and try another dish (maybe the Kung Pao \""chicken\""?)  Decor is a mix of trendy/hipster, kind of like a Pita Jungle feel to it.  (Tip to management, you might want to iron the tablecloths.  This doesn't bother me but you are in the middle of one of the snobbiest parts of Scottsdale so just a suggestion.)\n\nFor Pho, I will stick to traditional Vietnamese restaurants.  I would definitely recommend this place to a Vegetarian/Vegan friend, though."
0,"Tables were covered with thick white paper. Bread was served directly onto the paper cover. Hope it was replaced after previous customers. You can get the same quality of paper cover at the Macaroni Grill. At least there they write on it so you know you got a new cover. No bread plates, you had to keep putting your bread onto the table cover. The bread was a fancy woven design so had lots of crust and not much bread inside. If you want salt or pepper you have to ask for it, no shakers on the table. The waiter comes over and grinds the salt like they do pepper. Guess it is unacceptable to salt and pepper your own food. Fish served with the head on. French style? My wife thought the menu was rather limited and really did not find anything she liked. My daughter did not like it at all as it did not come across as a \""fancy\"" restaurant. She had steak and just barely was I able to stop her from asking for A-1 Sauce. She thought the steak was dry. The sound was pretty bad as there is little if any thought to sound control. Voices echo off the walls and if you want you can eavesdrop on conversations across the room.\n\nUnless you are really into \""authentic\"" French food, I would not recommend this place."
0,"Make SURE they don't put you in the South Tower unless you want a trash can for a view. You also feel like you are underground. Not my idea of Vegas! This is a maintenance tower w a strange & shady entrance. You can even take the elevator to the basement where service stuff was. It was my first impression of MGM and it wasn't good. However, their customer service gets an A+. They were very accommodating and moved us to the Grand Tower where the entrance is beautiful and we have a decent view now. Still not the best view and not the greatest hotel. The bath tub is super shallow. I think I prefer the Mandalay Bay."
0,"Similar problems as other reviewers, had a groupon for mani/pedi with hot stone and paraffin wax. I really hate when businesses treat you differently because you have a groupon. Me and my mother went in and both were bossed around about being late and not picking out colors quickly enough. When I sat down my water was so hot I couldn't put my feet in right away ( I like hot water, but it's winter I can't just plunge in) my tech comes over and pushes both my feet in! Guess I'm in. She starts on the pedicure and cut me a few times removing my cuticles. While she's doing that a gentleman comes over and slips the paraffin wax on my hands. The paraffin wax and hand massage felt good. My tech asks if I need callus remover, which at every other salon is $5, they charge $7 and didn't even do the entire bottom of my foot. When it comes time for my foot paraffin wax they slip the bag on my foot and I screamed because it was so hot. I tell her I'm in pain and she starts massaging the liquid around my foot so now my entire foot is burned! I should have called it quits then but my mom next to me wasn't complaining and I wanted her to enjoy. The hot towels were scorching and the stone massage lasted maybe 5 min. My manicure was also very clumpy and cloudy and started peeling off the next morning. Looked like all their polish was really old. I won't be returning. My plea to owners if you don't like people using groupon stop using groupon."
0,"Eek! Methinks not. Is the perfect way to describe how I feel about this place. I tried their pepperoni pizza just a simple large, pretty basic right? Well I wanted wings to eat with my so I though amazing pizza, until while I am ordering, they tell me they dont have wings!!!!!!! what kind of pizza parlor is it without wings? I also did not like the taste of the sweet tomato sauce, it was too fuffi for me, I did not enjoy the slices after the second one, it kept getting sweeter and sweeter for me. I will for now leave this place alone and not come back, maybe next year I will try them again, but in the mean time I will stick to Rhino D's"
0,I used to go to B Dubs a lot but their customer service has consistently diminished over time.\nI placed a carry out order and was told it would be ready in 20 minutes. So  I show up 25 minutes later only to find out that my order was still not ready and it would be another 10 minutes. So I payed for my order and proceeded to wait out the 10 extra minutes they estimated. Fast forward another 20 minutes and my food had still not been given to me. Then the girl up front asked me if I had been helped yet. Keep in mind she's the same one that helped me when I first arrived. I couldn't understand how after only 20 minutes she had forgotten that she previously helped me. \nI informed her that I was still waiting for my carry out order that she quoted to be only a 10 minute wait (on top of the other 20 minutes)\nIn the end my small $30 carry out order took roughly 55 minutes to be completed when I was initially told 20 minutes. And to top it all off my boneless wings were barely coated with sauce.\nI will definitely have to be craving wings for me to return and honestly I'll probably fix that craving by getting wings from somewhere else.
1,I had a great time browsing this store.  They had so many books to go through.  This store is really big and around every corner seemed to be another room filled with books.  The store is laid out in an easy to explore manner with all the books clearly organized by subject and author.  If you like browsing through bookstores like I do I would tell you this is a must visit store.
1,"Extremely enjoyable place with a warm atmosphere, fantastic Bloody Mary, great beer and whiskey selections"
0,"Bad ass is missed! I just ordered a simple coffee, but I was given an extra over watered americano. I barely tasted the coffee. I will try a latte next time cuz it smelled like the espresso is good if ordered right... we will see"
1,"What can I say. I've been taking my family here for three years now. I'm very please that they renovated and reopened. Same quality and friendliness. The area is bright and peaceful. The servers are attentive and helpful. Some people might get impatient with the food preparation wait...there's a reason for it. Once you order, your table will be covered with your entrees, drinks, and SIDE dishes. And you can ask for more side dishes (feel free to call them \""banchan\"") For a family of four my tabs usually under $80 for the typically combo meat.  There are times that we can't even finish all. You'll definitely will leave content. They check in a lot of times to make sure your food doesn't burn but you can adjust the heat yourself. It is open 24/7 but we generally go there for dinner only. During the weekend, the tables are packed but I've never seen anyone waiting for more than three minutes."
0,"Somehow we all decided to come karaoke! This is the second time I have set foot in this spot... Walking in, a certain scent invades my nose - it's a toilet bowl. Not cool. We get walked back to our karaoke room. We then had to wait about twenty minutes for our microphones. Why? Because they had to charge! Shouldnt a karaoke place have supplies ready for their patrons to use??!! After we waited we all sang for a bit and then: one of the microphones died in mid-song! WOW!!! I would think shit would work in their venue since we were paying for the karaoke room... \nWe also ordered french fries, apparently there were \""seven\"" orders in front of ours but it still took about thirty minutes. A little long to drop some fries in some hot oil.\nAnyway, the staff was nice enough but the karaoke could have been A LOT better experience."
0,"I like to give places a chance. I'm not a harsh critic, and don't always let a couple bad reviews steer me away from trying a place. In this case, I should have listened. \n\nFirst off, it wasn't horrible. The food was OK, nothing special. The service wasn't the worst I've had, as the waitress was attentive, but she mumbled and didn't really provide much more than subpar service. \n\nOverall my experience was underwhelming, and forgettable. I probably wouldn't choose to eat here again."
1,"My wife and I saw this show Nov 2013 and we really enjoyed it. The MC is the guy with the Birds from Americas Got Talent and he is okay as the host. The acts are kind of short but they are good. I would recommend it and it is good for families. I wish the magic was a little longer, but what we saw was fantastic. VIP tickets are not needed because the theater is not that big so views are okay anywhere pretty much."
1,"Last night we fancied getting a Chinese so off we dived into the depths of Just Eat. Long story short we chose New Haven Express Chinese. I remember when they first opened and they had a huge sign outside advertising the fact that they sold ostrich meat - very intriguing. However, neither Joe or I had actually ordered food from here before.\n\nThe menu is vast to say the least. They have it all and all sorts of meats at very reasonable prices. I opted for Kung Po ostrich and it was absolutely delicious. Not only this but their delivery is SUPER fast.\n\nOverall here are the reasons I have given it 5 stars:\n- Huge menu\n- Unusual meat options\n- Great value for money\n- Delicious!\n\nMy only quibble is that their crispy seaweed seems slightly overpriced (\u00a33.50) but I can live with that :)"
0,If I could give this place zero stars I would. My boyfriend and I stopped by here hoping for a nice lunch buffet. But instead got turned away for him not having a sleeve on his shirt?!! We waited for 2 hours in line for us to tell us that? On top of that it wasn't even lunch it was brunch served at 2pm? Costing us 82$. Plus they charged us 12$ for a shirt just to cover him up. I asked a lady why is that rule enforced. She said that Mr.wynn himself was eating there and saw a guy wearing a sleeveless shirt and he was hairy?! All because he saw one guy he assumes every guy is hairy? I just thought it was completely rediculous. I took my money somewhere else.
0,"The gym is dirty and old and the whole place is extremely smelly.  The \""trainers\"" were rude and uninterested in working with me.  When I complained about the trainers I was told they are really just coaches, but that's not what was said to me when I joined and they sold me a pack with a trainer.  Even if they are just coaches, there's no reason for them to be rude.  The staff was misleading with their sales contract and will say anything to get you to sign.  I was told I could switch to a pay in full plan at anytime, and then when I went to do that, was told that's not possible and there's absolutely no one in the company that can help.  In fact, the billing department said, we'll just cancel you membership and send it to collections instead of finding a resolution, and I was willing to pay them!  I'm not sure what I'll do to resolve the issue, because I've been reading other reviewers that said even if you pay them off they won't cancel your contract and just keep billing you anyway.  I would 100% not recommend joining this gym.  It's not a nice place, the staff isn't helpful, and the contract is a nightmare.  There's a 24 hour fitness just a block away."
1,"Excellent, excellent, excellent.  Consistently wonderful service and food."
1,"Different experience but well worth the trip. Ordering when you walk in isn't that new of a concept, but it seems to work well here. Drinks were brought to our table very quickly, and we didn't have to wait too long for our food. I wasn't a huge fan of the bloody mary's, as they were more of a veggie flavored mix with lots of pickled extras, but if you don't mind that, it may be right up your alley. The menu isn't huge, but the food is really good. Great breakfast potatoes, and I heard from my friends that the pancakes were delicious. I had the scramble, and you get to choose from a selection of great fresh ingredients, and I would highly recommend it. All of those in our group were very impressed and we would definitely come back again."
0,First off I'd like to say I've read a lot of the reviews for this place especially the newer reviews so I knew what we were getting into. With that being said I was still hoping to walk out and not feel guilty for blowing 50 bucks on dinner. Ofcourse it didnt work out that way. I still feel bad the next day. The only thing that saves me from getting really pissed was that we got to see the mermaid swim around in the huge aquarium in the casino area. She put on a great show so it was worth it in that respect.\n  I gave the place a star because at least the drink lady was nice to us. She seemed to be the only one actually working. The other buffet staff were just rude. I could even hear them complaining because we asked for a booth. That really pissed me off! I got a players card before we went to the buffet to get a slight discount. We still ended up paying $13.99 per adult. The kicker is they charged my 8 year old son adult price! I almost lost it. He hardly eats anything...well not like an adult anyway. They did charge my daughter half price because shes 6 years old. I assume she'll be an adult when she hits 7...lol. What a joke.\n  So the food flat out sucks. Most of the food tastes microwaved and even some stuff feels like its from the day before. Their wonton with crab was hard as a rock. I did like their bbq ribs. That was about the only thing that was decent. The guy cutting the rib roast was just hilarious. The first time I went to get a slice he gave me a paper thin slice. It was so tiny I thought he was joking but then he walked away... So I went back later to get another slice and I told him to give me a thick slice. Son of a b*tch gave me the same sized slice. So I asked for another slice. Bastard gives me another thin slice then he walks away. I was wondering if I was on some kind've hidden camera show or something. But after talking it over with my wife we came to the conclusion that they probably are told to only give small slices out because the one roast they have probably has to last the whole night. Just lame! So this place isn't worth it. For the same money other casinos have way better buffets and the quality is so much higher.
1,"This place was a bit small, but it reminds me of some sushi restaurants in Cali due to the many different variety of Japanese food you can find on the menu. I haven't been to another Japanese restaurant that has fresh sea urchin, etc. like this one. I will definitely go back again."
0,"I am updating and lowering the rating because after coming home and reviewing the credit card statement, the hotel overcharged us $500.00. In addition, one night a server at one of the restaurants gave herself an additional $70.00 tip (over the 20+ percent she was given, no less). Both issues were resolved to our satisfaction, however, a luxury hotel would not have these sort of issues. My time is important to me and I'd rather not have to call customer service and spend an hour on this. We have stayed here three times but will probably look elsewhere next visit. What a disappointing end to an otherwise nice time."
0,"Spa is tiny. Terrible.  You can hear someone urinate while in waiting room of locker area.  Sauna was 90 degree.  Massage rooms were located right off the main entrance of spa so you could hear all the ladies squawking while they were getting there nails done.  Neck rest broke while getting the massage...nobodies fault, didn't make for comfortable rest of massage though. \n\nAs for the hotel....service is slooowwww.  Rang the front desk and an average 15 rings before someone unapologetically picked up. One time 30 rings and another no one picked up.  The excuse was they were booked solid.  So!  Staff for it! Rooms were ok.  I'm a platinum Marriott member, I've been to a ton of hotels (travel for work) and many of them were Marriott resorts.  This one gets last place.  Even the house keeping was slow, we didn't get our room turned until 3pm.  Room service was good.  The only reason they received two stars from me,"
0,The croissants tasted weird. I should have went back to get my money back but didnt want to miss my flight.
1,"Love these guys!\n\nThey were quick to respond and did a quick (yet thorough) evaluation of my a/c unit. Came back with a very reasonable price, the unit was fixed 15 min later and the unit has worked perfectly ever since."
1,"I went on a 3-day trip through the Scottish Highlands called Skye High Scotland and I will never forget it. Though I tend to avoid touristy activities, it seemed like the smartest way to see the Highlands which are some of the most beautifully majestic landscapes in the world. The tour company is geared toward active young people who want to make their cash stretch far as possible. Highlights included Stirling Castle, Glencoe, Loch Ness, Eilean Donan Castle, Inverness, Fort Augustus, Isle of Skye and Colloden Battlefield. My favorite stop was called Quiraing on Isle of Skye. Just stunning, breathtaking scenery! The lodging arranged by the tour was at Morag's Lodge in Fort Augustus, just along the Loch Ness. This place was warm, clean, very comfortable and they prepared really great food for us. By night local musicians performed as we had a tartan toga party and learned traditional Scottish folk dancing! It was a ton of fun. Check out my pictures: http://bit.ly/16xJ0nC"
0,"There have been many times when I knew right away that I was in love with a burger, but rarely have I disliked one instantly. That is until now of course, in the case of Cheeburger Cheeburger. I actually stated \""I hate this bun\"" as soon as I swallowed my first bite, and it only went downhill from there. Read on if you dare.\n\nThere are apparently many locations all over the country of this place, although I can't say it's really been on my radar aside from a few recommendations through friends in town. And after my experience, I'm not sure if I would consider these folks my friends... the interior is kind of like a stand-alone Johnny Rockets; 50's diner style right down to the cheesy neon and stainless steel on the walls. It's extremely gimmicky, and much worse than any Fatburger I've ever been near. It wasn't overly crowded the night I was there for dinner, but there were several families and it really confused me as to how this place is popular.\n\nThe menu offers burgers ranging from 1lb down to a 5.5 ounce 'beginner', along with chicken sandwiches, wraps, salads and the option of supposedly over 1,285,000 combinations of shakes. They offer some odd toppings such as peanut butter, pepperoni and salsa. I guess there are options for anyone looking to create a disgusting burger.\n\nI was excited to see Heinz 57 sauce as an option, and mistakenly ordered it on my burger along with mushrooms, lettuce and tomato. As I said, upon first bite the bun turned me off; it was incredibly dry, had no flavor, and was way too thick and large for the sandwich. It was grilled and buttered on the inside, but that little bit of flavor couldn't compete with the vacuum of flavor created by the dryness. The meat was actually cooked quite well and had decent flavor, but the person I was eating with didn't have as much luck so I question their consistency and must assume I was lucky for now. My mushrooms had ok flavor but the small amount I was given got lost in the other flavors. And by other flavors I really just mean my Heinz 57 sauce, which completely took over the entire burger with its semi-BBQ flavor. I always thought I liked that sauce, but apparently not on burgers. I also must note that I only ordered the 1/3lb burger which I can easily handle, but this was so bad I only finished a little more than half.\n\nThe one positive factor of this meal was that because of my Foursquare check-in we were given a free order of small  1/2 fries and  1/2 onion rings. Both of them were ok; the fries were crispy and had decent flavor other than the couple of really undercooked ones that snuck in our basket. The onion rings were the thin, greasy, crispy battered type which I love, as opposed to the thick-breaded, hard to bite through variety. They were good, although I'm just not a huge fan of onion rings. They offer a few different dipping sauces; we went with the Zesty Horseradish sauce which was ok I guess.\n\nBy the time we were done with our meal we were completely dissatisfied and turned off by everything. We almost got mad that there were so many families and other people seemingly enjoying what they were eating. The only tasty parts of our meal were the Oreo and Peanut Butter Cup shakes we got, and that's not something I typically order. With the free fries and onion rings our meal cost $25.20, it would have been over $30 if those weren't free. This price does include $7.98 for two shakes, but is a bit too much for how unhappy we were. $6.99 for a burger isn't a bad price, especially off the strip, but what I was given I wouldn't pay for again. I'm not even going to sugarcoat it, just avoid this place."
1,Food: good! Chicken and waffles and potatoes. Great portions and decent prices. \n\nService: good for as busy as they are. \n\nAtmosphere: looks good but it is soooooo busy all the time and the wait sucks!!!\n\nWe love this place but you have to be patient. Expect a 45 minute wait.
1,"We found Surco to be a great experience for our first time dining Peruvian. Our entrees were very satisfying. I had Pollo Saltado and my husband had something similar, but with beef tenderloin. The chefs work will not go unrecognized for us. The soup before the meal was fantastic too. The atmosphere was clean and calm, and the waiter was very knowledged about Peruvian decent. His recommendations about the menu were very helpful. We can't wait to come back again. Do not pass this place up!"
0,"wow so...I finally got into Playboy/moon...yay...blah. Last year, I really wanted to get in here but the lines were out of control so I couldn't make it. Now, I see why those lines were out of control because of the infamous elevator I had to wait for to get upstairs, downstairs while my heavy buzz was running out, my killer heels were actually killing me with pain and the leech I was trying to get rid off couldn't understand a brush off. But you gotta love the view from the balcony...a definite must see of Las Vegas at night"
1,"Seriously one of my favorite places to eat at any one of the locations around the valley. I think I would eat here weekly if I could. They have awesome food, hummus and tabbouleh never cease to satisfy. I love their salads and the chicken schwarma rocks. The service is always good and the atmosphere is always fun with changing art pieces. The newest tapas/ happy hour is awesome and worth taking advantage of. Simply delicious!"
1,"I've been here 3+ times in the last few weeks and I'm already planning my upcoming visits. I've had great service and really great food.\n\nI always get the meat combo w/ sides. My two fave meats are brisket and pulled pork. My two favorite sides are collard greens and collard greens. :) Try the ribs too... Wow!\n\nAs a pie hater, I didn't think to order the cobbler a la mode, but due to the waiter's convincing promise of its goodness, we gave it try. Wow! It's one of the best restaurant desserts ever. I've only had blackberry. Try it, seriously.\n\nThere are coupons on the company's website that don't have an expiration, so just double check with your waiter if you can use 'em before ordering. I'm mos def a regular --- See you there!"
0,"It was okay. No lunch specials on the weekend. Over priced for the quality. No Yelp discounts. Very spacious, and Jasmine was good."
0,"I was there because the bouncer from Tao gave me & my girls VIP tickets with complementary drinks so it's like why not, lets go check it out. The place is pretty small, & crowded, The crowd mostly 30+ we were there for less than an hour and left. I just wasn't having fun there. =("
1,"Ate here while on a road trip with my cuban father... Loved it. Staff was friendly and Laid back, food tasted home made.\n\nWe ordered a bunch of apps and the fricase de puerco. Recommend the potato meatballs, plantain chips, and the pork fricase dish. \n\nHighlights include the garlic sauce that comes with the chips and the quality of the pork... Both were absolutely outstanding'"
1,"I heart this place for Bfast.  Pho Kim long is perfect for late night munchies BC they never close.   \n\nThere was only few other customers dinning early am. My order rare beef with a order of added meat balls arrived asap. The the fresh mints, sprouts and jalapeno made my pho yummy on a cold morning.\n\nAnother plus is they take credit cards with no minimum so I'll  certainly return here for bfast for the convenience."
0,"Stayed at Venetian for my bday couple of days ago. I thought Wynn was bad...This was horrible!!!!!!\nWe were told a room with strip view, we did not get it! I called the front desk and the person was very rude so i asked for the manager. She promised us a room with a view for the next day because she said she doesn't have any availability for that day from 11am to 3pm. we get the room after 5pm waiting for them in our room. Than we go the the new room it was the same exact room just 9 floors up! So i call the manager again and she says that she can not do anything about it. Not to mention we waited over an hour for the bell boy to bring our luggages.\n\nTheir customer service and management is rude and have no management skills!!!\n\nI would NOT recommend it."
0,"Came in for a quick to go order the staff was talking amongst them selves and yelling across the restaurant jokingly. \n\nI tried to order the a bread bowl but they were out of the bowls. The girl offered to comp me extra prices of bread to go with it so it so I ordered. I get my order and \""the entire store is out of bread\"". It was kind of like oh well we are out. I came later so I kind of understand the lack of bowls but they offered something they couldn't follow through with which was annoying. The store overall just had a very unprofessional atmosphere which was irritating. I feel like I paid $6 for a small cup of soup from a bunch of kids which wasn't the experience I anticipated. Will probably continue to go to the boca park location from now on."
1,"My team had a great dinner here one night. The atmosphere and the service were both extremely pleasant. \n\nThe meatballs that we shared as an appetizer were enough for 3 people to get a good taste. My toasted ravioli (a heavy dish, to be sure) was very filling and satisfying."
1,"I'll trade you one food city for one Trader Joes... I wish it worked that way!  My only gripe with TJ's is that there isn't one in old town.   I work in Tempe, so I manage to hit this one on my way home every once in a while.  TJ's is always busy, but the service is never lacking. TJ's employees are pretty knowledgeable about their wine selection, and have helped me find some great wines for super cheap.   My favorite thing about TJ's is they have a ton of vegetarian options and a rockin selection of hummus and dips!  As much as I love TJ's, the main downfall is that I can't go there for all my grocery needs, their produce section and \""staple\"" items are pretty limited."
1,"Everyone once in a while, you come across a place that is special and amazing.  This is one of those places.  The food is fresh and delicious and the unique flavors and ingredients just make the ChopShop stand out against similar establishments.  I visited from NY and wish we had something like this here!   I love the bowls and the juices - proof that it is possible to have healthy, flavorful and well priced food.  I also have to mention that a few members of the staff really went out of their way to be both personal and helpful in many ways and that made a huge impact on my already positive impression of this place.   I hope to be back soon!"
0,"I feel bad having to give the Venetian only 2 stars.  The hotel was amazing.  The rooms beautiful, clean and comfortable.  The service was top-notch.\n\nBUT...the scent they pump through this hotel is so overpowering you can literally taste it.  I asked the front desk if a perfume bottle broke or something and they proudly told me it was their signature scent, \""Seduction\"" (translation=cheap old lady perfume).  It is pumped through the air ducts.\n\nKnowing what we do now about chemical fragrance products being toxic ...I can't believe they continue to do this.  It's in all parts of the hotel, even the restaurants.  When I left the hotel my hair even smelled like it.  :(  \n\nI really did love the Venetian, but this made me not want to spend my time there or come back."
0,"The food and prices are good, the service literally sucks.\nIt was good when we first started going there, but recently the service is very bad.\nThey get our drink order, start drawing up the beer, then when the beer is about half way filled the bartender decides to go chat with someone.\nAfter about 4 minute he came back and asked if we was ready to order. \nEvery drink we had to chase the bartender down, and they only had 7 customers setting at the bar and one table with 4 people.\nThe female bartender that comes on at about 4:30 does not go focus on serving the customers, I think her job is to just hang over in front of the customers showing her big cleavage. That's pretty much all she is good for, she won't take any customers orders.\nWe are done with this place."
0,"One star is one too many for this company, but you can't choose zero!\n\nDON'T purchase from this company. What you pay for is NOT what you get! I purchased two dozen roses for a friend dying of cancer. She had never received two dozen roses in her lifetime at one time and I wanted to make that happen for her. Paid for them and she only got 20, and only 16 of those fit in the vase that i purchased from same company  for the two dozen roses. complained within 48 hours and have been getting strung around for a month now with no results. day 28 of complaint process they ask me for a photo?   I ask that you friend them on facebook if you also have a complaint, then report them for scamming. there is a link right on the page to do it. Companies should not be allowed to get away with this!"
0,"It was our first time at sandbar, me and a friend got the jalepeno mac n cheese. And my boyfriend got the calamari. The jalepeno mac was missing the cheese and jalepeno...it was tateless. And my bf had a hair in his calamari! The waitress we had seemed to have an attitude, and when I told her it was our first time here she didn't even explain the menu. I don't think she even introduced herself. The only reason I gave this place two stars is because the manager was very sweet and gave my bf a new plate of calamari and took it off our bill. She was very apologetic! Other than that, my experience was not great and I would rate it less."
1,"Hands-down the best Thai food in town. You haven't had pad Thai until you've tried it here. Always quality food and at a very reasonable price. It seems like the owners are always here making everyone feel welcome. I am really looking forward to trying their new place in Ocotillo. Oh, and the cantaloupe martini is a must."
1,"I have been going to EN since they first opened and it is always great!  The fish is fresh, the rolls are unique and the same chef's are always there and are great!  Everyone that works there is very friendly and remembers you.  \n\nI love the BAM BAM roll, but have had so many rolls there.  They are all really good!  Lisa Lisa, Something Wrong, on and on...even the simple rolls and sashimi are wonderful.\n\nThe purple haze is pretty cheap sake but tasty and I love having it once in a while (when I'm not having green tea).\n\nTheir homemade desserts are delicious!\n\nAbout the prices: I feel they are very reasonably priced, especially for the size of the rolls and the quality of the food.  If you get a specialty roll, they run about $13 but it's enough to fill one person up.\n\nLove EN!!!"
1,"Went to Majerle's for Trivia on Tuesday.. Its c ool because all the questions come up on the screens, but was too loud from the background music and random customers to focus on the questions. Food is good, and the 2 for 1 beer special is pretty awesome.  rated the place for being good, but not my first choice."
1,"Thank you Mix Lounge. \nTY for the best view of Vegas I've ever seen. TY for being oh so cool. Thank you for letting us walk right on in after eating at your amazing restaurant right next door. Thank you for the great music mixes. TY for having plenty of seating even though we weren't buying bottles. TY for amazing pomegranite martinis and a patient bar tender while I debated over dirty, cosmo or 'something different' and for suggesting the delish pom-tini. TY for being the perfect place for me to bring my hubby and best friend and her fiance. TY for not making us scream over music while we laughed, talked and drank. TY for our sweet little cocktail waitress that came over right as soon as we were finishing one drink and ready for another. Thank you last but not least for having the best view from a toilet I have ever seen, vegas or elsewhere."
1,"Great hang out spot. Their burgers are some of my favorites! Their churros are great, too. Open late. Cheap. Taco Tuesday friendly! Ask for a quad burger or a triple del! They'll add parties onto the burgers for an extra charge."
0,"Let me start off by saying that the alterations weren't horrible, but then again, they weren't great.\n\nI stopped into May's with about 5 button up shirts and a pair of jeans. I tried on the jeans she measured me, we agreed on a length and then I moved onto trying on the shirts. The first shirt I needed the to be taken in as it was too baggy/ballooning. She told me she was going to add darts instead of taking it in on the sides. She suggested that because it would 'look better and is cheaper than taking it on the sides'.\n\nNext shirt was too long and I needed it to be shortened. She asks me how short, and I said hmm I'm not exactly sure, but I brought a sample shirt that has a good length. She kinda snaps at me and tells me \""No, it's too late to show a sample, you should have told me that from the beginning, I'm too busy for that\"". Honestly, at that moment I should have gotten my things together and said I don't want to give you my business. Unfortunately I just kind of froze and said ok and let her pin it shorter. I didn't really feel like dealing with her anymore so I didn't bother bring out the other 3 shirts I brought me to be altered. I paid for the alterations and was given a 1 week turn around time.\n\nThe jeans came out great, but the 2 shirts.....not so much. I know understand why she suggested darts rather than taking it in from the sides. She made 2 pinches of fabric in the back of the shirt and sewed on the inside so there is the excess fabric on the inside of the shirt.\n\nThe shirt that was to be shortened ended up being too short. I suppose that is somewhat my fault since I should have insisted that she let me try on the other shirt. My other complaint about that shirt is that there is a button 3 cm away from the bottom of the shirt which looks pretty awkward. I have had clothes altered at other places that have gone to great lengths to make the clothes look normal after the alteration. I would not come back here for any other services.\n\nI guess you could say that if you are wanting a basic job done with a quick turn around time, use May's Alteration. If you have more intricate alterations to be done, I'd be weary of using her since it seems its about a quick turn around time and not that much about quality of tailoring. \n\nOn the plus side, the alterations are somewhat cheap, the place is clean, and they have a pretty quick turn around."
0,"This center bar is just cringe-worthy. Loud, packed, and obnoxious. Though, I guess it just comes down to timing? Almost naked women gyrating to a bad DJ in a tiny bar packed with drunk fools isn't exactly my idea of a good time. It's not even good people-watching."
0,"Heard this was a really cool place. Friday night, got on guest list and didnt have to pay, bonus, arrived with about 12 people, no probem or very long line to get in. Entrance included 1 free well drink for women. Entered and was greeted by some costumed entertainers, they were neat. Room was, a little small, but cool looking. Went to bar and the female bartender was very snappy and rude. Tip, women guest should use male bartenders. Didnt really see the main performers that people rave about. Only Stayed about 2 hours after it opened. Crowded on the dancefloor, people not dancing. And I think some weird older, fat,  anglo man in nice clothes may have put some kind of date rape drug in my friends drink, so ladies beware!! Dont leave your drinks open around strangers! My girlfriend passed out cold after only 2 drinks, it was very weird, but she is fine. I will return and stay later to see the performers because most of th reviews say that it is a really neat place."
0,"Way overpriced for the service and the food. My steak was overcooked and it took the waiter a few tries to get everyone the correct entr\u00e9e. With so many dining choices in the area, they really need to step it up. I will never come back here."
1,Ppl waiting in line for free burgers on National Hamburger Day!
0,"We stopped by here on Sunday late afternoon after a movie at the AMC.  I've driven by here many times and was always curious.  I love a good brewery.  Usually the food is good in breweries as well...but not here.  I should have paid closer attention to the 3 star rating on Yelp!  Yikes...\n\nIt was cool and raining outside so we both ordered the Lobster Bisque...it was really nasty.  It was very slimy and mucusy tasting.  We were served bread, it's a kind of flat bread that is usually served with herbs and oil, but this bread was cold and served with cold hard butter.  It wasn't very tasty.\n\nMy companion ordered a chicken sandwich with the garlic fries...I ordered the daily special for a hamburger and garlic fries.\n\nBoth sandwiches were mediocre at best. Honestly it's a tastier hamburger at Sonic.  I didn't taste the fries because by this time I was just disgusted at the whole meal.\n\nOn the plus side, our server was very good as was the beer. Unfortunately for our server she made the mistake of asking if everything was good.  Now I wouldn't have ever said anything if she hadn't asked, I would have just left and never went back. But she asked and I told her how it just wasn't very good.  She did everything she could to make amends, offering us free dessert etc.  \n\nWe weren't there to take advantage or to try and get a discounted meal, it truly wasn't good and I truly won't go back."
0,"This place is ALWAYS packed during weekends which tells me this is a great dinner spot. BUT REALLY IT'S NOT!?!? The food is just \""OK\"" I don't understand why this place is always so busy??? The service was good, salad- good, their filet mignon was OK, and their bread is whack.  They also bring this stuff to dip your bread into.  They called it something sorta fancy-like but really- it's just cottage cheese mixed with I forget what. LOL seriously- Travis and I were laughing out loud at how we were dipping our soft day old tasting bread into cottage cheese.  We drive by it and out loud pretend like we are yelling at all the people eating there, and yell out,  \""IT'S NOT THAT GOOD!\"" because it really isn't!! Why is it always so busy?!?!"
1,Excellent and you can bring your own wine.
1,"Their food always tastes homemade and the omelets are fantastic.  I would definitely recommend the biscuits and gravy as well.\n\nI've read some comments on here about the service, but we have been there over a dozen times and never have had a bad experience. It does get really busy on the weekends but as long as you're patient and you don't go into there expecting McDonald's like speed, you shouldn't be let down."
0,"Was looking to grab a quick bite with my 8-yr old and decided to yelp restaurants that offered happy hour specials.  Embers popped up and after reading the reviews we decided to check it out.  \n\nEmbers is located in Boca Park and the atmosphere is fabulous!  The patio is huge and the decor is sleek.  We were definitely under-dressed but our visit was very impromptu.  We happened to be hungry at 5pm on a Tuesday afternoon.\n\nHowever, regardless of how you're dressed, you should always greet customers with a smile.  When we walked in we were coldly greeted by a young lady.  I told her we wanted to enjoy their happy hour menu, and she looked at us like \""well I'll be lucky to get $5 in tip from these chumps.\""  She sat us in the empty patio and also happened to double as our server!!  LOL\n\nWe ordered 5 of their happy hour dishes, which is basically $2 off their starter menu.    I also enjoyed a couple glasses of the $4 Stella drafts.  \n\nSome of the food was really good.  Some were inedible.  Our server warmed up after we ordered...I suppose after she rung up our $100 worth of food and drinks??\n\nEmbers Sliders $7 on HH\nTwo really tasty little burgers with a delicious & generous serving of fries sprinkled in kosher salt and black pepper.  I would return for this.\n\nChilean Sea Bass Skewers $14 on HH\nReally bad.  Overly marinated and over cooked.   The salad that it came with was terrible also.  This was inedible.  \n\nTempura Rock Shrimp Misto $10 on HH\nThis was delicious!  Battered and fried rock shrimp, peppers, and avocado.  My first time enjoying tempura avocado and it was AWESOME!\n\nSpicy Ahi Tuna $13 on HH\nSpicy tuna on crispy rice cakes and drizzled with ponzu sauce.  Pretty good.  I've had this at other restaurants.  Not bad.\n\nCrispy Beef Tacos $7 on HH\nThis was disgusting.  The beef was battered in some teriyaki sauce and deep fried.  The beef was topped with a pickled cucumber and red onion mixture.  Gross.\n\nGrilled Steak Salad $16 (regular menu to-go)\nI ordered this to go for my wife.  It was okay.  The steak was tiny.  The steak salad at Grape Street is MUCH better.\n\nAll-in-all....great atmosphere, mediocre service, and inconsistencies with the food.  I would return for the Sliders and Shrimp Misto."
0,"Staff was rude, useless, not helpful, unprofessional and incompitant. I took my 2 sons their for a hair cut. I went back a couple of times to make sure the number on the razor was short enough while she was shaving his head. Rather than her doing the entire thing over agian and me being unhappy with it. in other words, i was trying to do the stylist a favor. while she is cutting my 6 year olds hair who is also autistic im by his side trying to keep him leveled out cause he NEEDS to stay calm and still,  the stylist tells me to go back and wait in the waiting room. I wouldnt leave my child unattended in a doctors office let alone in a hair salon. Soon after a father comes in with his child (her 1st haircut,) and the manager finally decided to come out from the back to cut her hair after they already had 4 people waiting in line. Then she tells him to step aside a couple time and he's more concerned about his daughter and how she's going to react to a stranger of course cutting her hair and she tells him very rudely to go and stand on the carpet. I'll take my kids, tips and business else where.\n\n FYI \""Precious\"" is no longer woking there and many customer were asking fir her...."
0,"Okay so I tried this place twice before writing a review to give them a fair shot. Unfortunately, the second visit wasn't any better.\n\nI will start with the good. Service is pretty good.\n\nThe place smells of smoke. Why? Because you can smoke in the bar and there is an opening from the bar into the restaurant. This has to be a violation of the no smoking in dining areas in Pittsburgh. Gross. \n\nThe floor (carpeted) is so old that it is sticky and worn down. Walking on it with shoes on disgusted me. The walls have wall paper torn off throughout the place. Please, remodel! At least make me feel like the place is clean. If I feel like it is dirty in the dining hall, I can't imagine it's clean in the kitchen.\n\nNow for the food. I am pretty picky about seafood. It needs to be fresh and cooked correctly. Don't get the Salmon or Tuna Steak. Tuna and Salmon should be easy to get right if you just season and cook it properly. Both tasted very fishy to me. Salmon that tastes overly fishy, to me, screams \""this fish is not fresh\"". Mashed potatoes are not made from real potatoes. Don't get them unless you are looking to eat boxed potatoes. I get it, you wanna have a mom and pop shop. But to do that you need to have great food.\n\nOverall, I just don't think this place is good, and don't want to go back."
0,"Plenty of real ale on tap and being in Stockbridge are the 2 things going for Stocky Tap. On their own, big positives. \n\nOn the downside, service can be a little snooty and there is definitely a preference shown to locals when queueing for drinks...or at least that's what I've experienced...too many times now not to comment. Lift your service Stocky Tap."
0,"This was actually my second time eating at the big 'C'(mind out of the gutter), i had been here a good 2-3 years ago for dinner. One of the first things about Cibo that draws you in is the expansive patio with benches, fire pit, and tables for service. I imagine that the fire pit and benches come in handy on a busy Friday night while you swill some wine waiting for your table. My man-date and i had stopped by the vintage craftsman home that is Cibo for a Friday lunch anticipating pizza-y goodness... nope, sandwiches and salads only for lunch.  Alright, we are big boys, no crying, suck it up, roll with the punches.  Sadly to say after perusing the sandwiches and salads i wasn't overly excited about anything, it was all a pretty much boring standards.  That isn't to say it didn't sound edible but i honestly expected a little more than the standard Prosciutto and Motz sandwiches of any Italian deli. I settle the PLT but with added Motz (BLT but Prosciutto instead of bacon) and my buddy got the Pastrami. If nothing else Cibo has amazing bread, everything else was a little boring.  The bell pepper aioli vaguely smelled like anchovies which freaked me out but i decided to eat it anyways, i am still feeling okay hours later as i write this, don't worry. The salad that came with was tasty but i could have done with less pine nuts/garnish and more attention to the sandwiches.  Nothing was terrible but i don't think i would ever rush back to eat lunch, i think i am going to try and do dinner later this week before i head back to CA but it might get passed over for Spinatos or Bianco.\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/9a3DrZvpYxVs3k_qwlCNSw?select=pxm0cOIoLBj5CGjYAvw8Lw\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/9a3DrZvpYxVs3k_qwlCNSw?select=hd-s0jAenKqoNg-hUqnPMQ\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/9a3DrZvpYxVs3k_qwlCNSw?select=z63anYfNP879CV749HlyNg"
1,"Back at Rudy's again for some more BBQ. Better customer service this visit and a good helping of turkey ordered to go at $6.29 per 1/2 pound. No frills, no bread taken and no sauce taken either. If you look at the ingredients in all of Rudy's sauces, they are a mess of preservatives and weird stuff that does not belong in good BBQ sauce. You really don't need sauce and if you get it to to go, you go use your own choice at home. Creamed corn was decent, but much better version at Texas BBQ house."
0,"The showroom is very tiny. Here's a tip - Do NOT fill out the \""Win a VIP\"" Tour cards outside of the store. It is a scam. I got a call saying I won and was offered a hotel package as well. I was driving so I couldn't take down any information. I called back 3 times and was ignored. Then my number was blocked. I googled the number they called me from and turns out they were also try to scam them into PAYING $199 to receive the package. I guess they blocked me because I'm a local. Disappointing because I would've loved a stay-cation. Here is the number they called me from - just google it and the comments will appear: 702.331.8691"
0,"I've been here a couple times for college football game day. I go because this is where the Michigan State alumni are gathering this year. Wings were great and I know management has worked really well with the alumni association.  That said,  service was amongst the worst I've ever experienced,  both times. Absolutely not enough servers to handle the crowd. I had the same server both times.  She consistently forgot (or ignored?) orders for water or coffee for everyone I spoke with.  She only checked on one of her established regulars in the 4 hours I was there last week. Everyone else in my vicinity had to flag her down for attention and then,  maybe,  got what they needed eventually. This is a place for drinking.  If you're not boozing hard enough that you don't care about the service,  it may not be for you. I don't drink so not a place I care to visit again soon."
1,"Great stuff, far above the average old town scottsdale sushi quality, great place for fresh tasting sushi.\n\nGood for a calm or quite date night, will deff be going back."
0,"We arrived at rehab burger on a Sunday afternoon in late July- thought it would be not be crowded, but pretty much every table was taken.  We got seated right away, and the waitress came over pretty quickly.  We asked for water and some time to kook at the menu.  Took a few minutes, but got the water.  My husband ordered the hatch chile medium well with fries and I ordered the byob with mustard and pickles and onion ringsI ordered a glass of wine and my husband ordered a beer.  After a long time -10 minutes or so the waitress came back with a beer and a mixed drink- said no that's not mine and she asked could I repeat my drink order.  I did and about 5 minutes later it arrived.  And then we waited, and waited and waited.  Finally the food arrived.  Hatch burger medium RARE (not well) with sweet potato tots not regular fries.  No ketchup; aioli instead.  My hamburger arrived with lettuce, tomato, onion, mushroom and pickles, no mustard in sight.  I took it all off and asked the hostess for mustard - which she delivered quickly.  I was also given fries instead of onion rings because according to the waitress they were \""still in the fryer,\"" and would come out later.  By the time the rings came out I was full and didn't want them.  We then asked the waitress to change our tab due to the problems and she said she would send the manager over.  Well she didn't and we had to ask the hostess to send the manager over.  The manager came over quickly (guess the waitress didn't tell her) and was very sympathetic and accommodating.  She comped the whole bill, even though we were willing to pay for drinks and things that had gone ok.  I think the waitress was the problem here, not the food or the management, but it was hard to know since we didn't eat much."
1,"What a great place to have a fun dinner with the family.  Did not really know what to expect but I am so glad that we went.  The staff is so nice and the food is great.  It is served all you can eat family style.  You get Ham, chicken and ribs.  It also comes with bean, cole slaw, green beans and fresh bread as well as drinks and cookies for desert.  You eat off of metal plates with metal cups just like the miners did back in the day.  The kids loved it as much as we did.  There is a cute two man band that plays and keeps everyone happy.\n\nAlso I can not say enough about the staff.  They are all so friendly and helpful.  This is now our new spot to take out of town guests."
0,I was disappointed to say the least.
1,I have been going here sense I was a kid! They have the best food that is not comparable to anything else! It is a must try restaurant!! I always leave pleased :)
1,"Best haircut I have ever received, Pittsburgh or otherwise.  Ryan obviously has a love for what he does and an eye for style.   All this and the price is right.  Walk-ins only,so you might have to wait for someone to finish, but that was not my experience."
0,"Interior is terrible... the fish tank looked disgusting and the little turtle pond was creepy. I called in and placed an order for my friend and I and was told to come in 20 minutes to pick up the food. 20 minutes later I arrive and tell the server that I called in an order. She then asks what I ordered, writes it down on paper, and tells me it's going to be another 15 minutes...... literally four other customers inside the dingy restaurant. I would recommend any other pho place above this restaurant. Seriously."
0,"From what I hear 300 East used to be a good restaurant. Not anymore. \nTonight was the 4th time I've been there in the past couple years. The first 3 trips weren't bad but definitely weren't good. Tonight was more along the lines of awful. \nService: awful. It tooke us over 2 and a half hours for dinner for 6 people (We had apps but no dessert). It was slow, our waitress was absent, and it took them forever to clear our plates. \nFood: awful. Three of us got burgers and they were flavorless and over-cooked. My sister in law got the pork tenderloin and it came out cold. The crab cakes were eh. The salmon nothing special. \nThe few pluses: good local draft beers. Good coffee. That's it. \nIn a city with plenty of good restaurants, don't waste your time on 300 East"
0,"TACOS? Not really.... first of all the tortilla was cold the shrimp was not good flavor wise and the fish one was ehh I also had a \""carne asada\"" not good. The sides I Had white rice and Beans not good. the place is a cool hang out spot nice bar. If I ever come back it would be to have a drink at the bar but I wont even give the food another try. I have to say rubios is WAY better their tacos are actually good."
1,"fabulous food, great price. The ladies who make the food and bring it out are sweet and wonderful people who make me feel like i'm at their house instead of at a restaurant.  If i could change anything it would be the guys at the front- the older gentleman chews tobacco while he's talking to you and sometimes spits, and the younger one- I guess his son- has a serious lack of people skills but i'll put up with both for the goodies that come out of that kitchen- try the vada paav or the gol guppa chaat....yum."

0,"I like this place. I want to begin by saying that. It's affordable and the after hours allows for you to keep the party going long after the bigger nightclubs close.\n\nThat being said, there are a few issues that leave something to be desired.\n\n-Our reservation was for a double bed. Upon arriving, all that was available was a queen. This was very disappointing. They couldn't even offer us a rollaway. One guest had to sleep on the floor.\n\n-On Facebook, an open bar is frequently advertised from 10-11. This is an awesome thing to offer guests, but often the bartenders are nowhere to be found. They only serve one type of vodka (which is pretty good), but often they don't have this vodka present at the bar (for whatever reason). \n\n-Furthermore, in regard to the open bar, the bartenders seemed very annoyed that's what I was there for (pregaming). I tipped well and all, but they were not happy that I was attending for the open bar. I couldn't really understand why.\n\n-Lastly, if you need more bottles of water or towels, I hope you're not in a hurry. It takes around 45 minutes for whatever you need to find it's way to your room.\n\nAll in all, this is a fun place to stay and they have a lot to offer. I just feel like it could use some polishing."
1,"Dim Sum and then some\n\nDefinitely one of the best Dim Sum in Phoenix if not the best.  Only served during lunch.  Not good for romantic date, because of the noise of shuffling carts of food throughout your meal, but usually occurs during lunch time Dim Sum.  Good selection of steam dumplings and pork buns to crunchy deep fried shrimp balls. Don't miss the shrimp rice noodle.  Service is pleasant and friendly.  Cost is reasonable.   Ambiance is nice.  There is a baby grand piano, but only played at night for dinner.  It is comparable to California standards.  Good ROA (ratio of authenticity) about 60-70%. (#Chinese Patrons/#total Patrons)."
1,"I went here with three friends. We kept it simple: a bottle of wine and three pizzas. Each pizza was great, and none of us could agree on which was the best. The three we ordered were: Due Forni (Neapolitan), Bianca al Prosciutto Cotto (Roman), and the Tartufo (Neapolitan). My only knock I have is that the Neapolitan pies were a bit soggy in the middle. Other than that, all of the pies were bursting with flavor. The Tartufo may be a bit rich if you do not mix it up with some other selections. The service was great, as two different managers came by to check on us, and both had honest opinions and helpful recommendations. Our server was a tad pushy on up-selling, but as someone in the game, I see where he is coming from. The atmosphere was satisfactory. But this place is about one thing first and foremost, and that is churning out two distinct styles of Italian pizzas, and they do that exceptionally well."
0,"I wish I could leave a review for the food but I never got that far. \n\nCame in, was immediately seated and handed the menu. 20 minutes later still no waiter, no acknowledgment from any of the servers or anyone that works there. So we decided to leave, I'm all for being patient but  20 minutes with no acknowledgement REALLY?! Sorry, we were told happy new year on the way out. Did I mention the place was only at 60% capacity. \n\nThanks Osaka you really know how to treat your customers."
1,Radio Maria has great and unique food! I went on a date here and absolutely loved it! Every dish is most likely something you would never think of creating but it will be soo good!  The selection of wines is excellent as well!
1,"Mario and Ginger are awesome!  Love going to the small, neighborhood restaurant. Everything is fresh and the food is excellent.  The bread is awesome too. If you're dieting; stay out!"
1,"Okay, I haven't lost my mind... this is not a 4 star hotel... But I rate it 5 stars considering the bargain price I paid which was $67 for 2 premium nights, Friday and Saturday nights for a 2br/2ba suite. It was this cheap because I used a $50 discount coupon I got from Expedia.com my online booking agent. Also there was a special stay one night, get one night free. With a roomie, this worked out to about $18/day for a room with free internet and kitchen. It's unlikely I would stay here if it was just myself as it's not worth the time/effort to just cook for one person. But the free internet is worth $12-18 per day which is about what I paid for the room!\n\n There's barebones cookware but adequate. Full size fridge, 4 burner gas stove and oven. There's a coffee maker but no coffee is supplied. It used the small Mr. Coffee round filters which I got lucky and brought some along that fit perfectly and I brought my own coffee/fixins. Units are advertised to have dishwashers, but my unit didn't have one so I had to buy dw soap and scrubber at the 99 cent store down the street. No biggie as I can use them at home. Microwave in place. There is NO food stuffs... No oil/salt/pepper/ketchup/etc but of course I brought everything I needed from home as I had planned to cook omelettes and home fry potatoes with bacon so no problem. But, I've stayed at time share condos before and sometimes the bare essentials are in the unit, but I cannot deduct for none with today's lawsuit freaks out there these days. Place settings for 4, actually about a 20 piece cook set. No sharp chef's knife or veggie peeler but I of course figured that and brought from home... Yeah, I was a friggin Boy Scout... LOL\n\nI deducted one star because it didn't have a dishwasher as advertised and the ft desk said the maid would wash our dirty dishes but that didn't happen. Also, I requested more chairs for our poker game, but they didn't have any housekeeping staff to get us chairs.\n\nThe room was decent sized, 3 flat screens, the bedrooms were quite large but I wish the br's were a bit smaller so that the living space could have been bigger as I brought in a poker table so we could play a friendly game of poker.\n\nI requested a non-smoking ground floor 2br suite close to parking and that's exactly what they gave me. My car was 5 ft from my front door. Ha! Stay at one of the mega hotels and if you self park, you will spend 5-15 minutes walking to your car if you can find it. Free coffee in the office, FREE hi-speed internet but bring a RJ45/Cat 5 cable. However, my roommate was able to access free wifi as well, but we were about 30 ft from the registration office, so maybe we were lucky or there's free wifi in the office that is not advertised.I did bring my own wifi router and was able to successfully configure it so that I could use it in the suite. I preferred it so that I could have better wifi security, but I did test out the existing wifi and it seemed to work fine on my laptop. \n\nLocation: I prefer staying off the strip so I actually consider it a plus. Usually I stay Downtown on Fremont St. so I guess I'm a freak that I don't like staying on the Strip. So be it. I like saving the money, avoiding the horrific traffic and drunk drivers. But I usually go to Vegas to play poker and will go to the various different casinos where I hear of a good cash game or well structured tournament."
0,"Looking foward to our guys night out at Fogo. Found the staff to  pompous and rude. Went to go sit down and asked about their corkage fee it was $45 per bottle. When we asked to speak to a manager to see if this is true, due to the large amount that was quoted , we were met with a rude reply. So the six of us just got up and went next door. Their neighbor was more than happy to accommodate us in only charge us $15 for a corkage fee. Don't get me wrong  I don't mind paying a little more for corkage fee at a nice restaurant, but really it's just a glorified buffet. The sad part is we probably would have dropped about $600 that night. Maybe we'll go to Texas de Brazil next time ."
1,"I thought this place had closed their west side location but I was glad to find out they just relocated. My husband and I ordered the Geisha special which comes with Fillet Mignon, Chicken, Shrimp Lobster, appetizer, soup, salad ,fried rice and a drink for $35.95. My husband doesn't eat seafood so I let him have some of my steak and chicken in exchange for his seafood. When the chef first started to warm up by juggling the spatula and big barbecue fork I was scared. He kept missing ...I was thinking that fork was going to end up in my eye! He got better though...he threw an egg in the air and sliced it in half with the spatula ...I was impressed. The chef was very entertaining he took this bottle and it looked like it squirted at me but it was just a prank. He was also joking with my husband who accidentally thanked him in Spanish..I didn't think he caught it until he was packing up his stuff and as he left he said, \""Gracias\"". Eric who was our server was also very nice and personable he says he makes the best Sake Bombs around . We didn't have a Sake bomb but we did have Sour Apple Sake which was very flavorful. The meal was good I LOVE their fried rice here. It's one of the best I've tried in a restaurant. They put this pink stuff that looks like watermelon sorbet in everything they cook. I don't know what it is but it makes everything yummy. These are large portions so between me and my husband we had a full take home box to enjoy during the week."
1,"After a fine meal at Terrazo, the  girl and i opt for dessert at the Resort Bakery - Baby Cakes.\n\nVarious baked goods and gelatos.  Alot to choose from. For $15, we picked up a beautiful fruit tart, a pistachio cheesecake ( sugar free )  a chocolate eclair and a lil bag of cookies.  \n\nThe eclair was perfect ! the fruit tart - well, i ain't a fruit tart kinda guy, but it was ok, the cookies, a little to crunchy for me but decent flavor - especially liked the chocolate chip.  I didn't get to try the cheesecake but based on how my daughter wolfed it down, it was good !\n\nAgain, the food places at the M Resort seem to understand the concept of reasonable pricing."
1,Extremly small store but it's filled with all kinds off goodies!
1,"This place has changed names several times over the years, but the basic concept of sports pub has stayed the same. It has consistently offered fine burgers. My favorite is currently the mushroom burger. The flatbread pizzas and chicken wings are quite tasty too. \n\nThe current stand out feature of this place has to be the \""all-you-can-drink, make-your-own-drink,\"" bar buffet. Not sure if it is offered year-round, but we were there on a Saturday in October for college football. It works like this: Pay $30 and from 11:00AM to 3:00PM you walk up to the bartender, who pours you whatever poison you want, as many times as you want during those 4 hours. There is a table set up with all sorts of mixing ingredients for you to get creative with. I made one hell of a Bloody Mary...just couldn't say no to all the different peppers and horseradish in front of me. (Tip: You may want to consider staying at the Monte Carlo if you are considering this. It is quite difficult to make it anywhere else after taking advantage of the full 4 hours)."
1,"Best BBQ place in NC!\nAll their specials are to die for, very affordable and such a friendly staff. VERY clean too!\nHigh recommended1\n\nWhat more does a girl need than a BBQ sandwich with pepperjack cheese, original sauce & vinegar base, fries, and a classic bottle Cheerwine. Only men I ate yesterday because I knew nothing else would taste that good."
1,"So I've come to the conclusion that Anthony Bourdain is kind of a sucky food critic. Why? Just look at the way the man smokes and drinks, WHILE eating his food! You think after all that tar and alcohol his taste buds are still working properly?? You only need to read his books to know that he isn't even conscious half the time he's eating. \n\n\""Oh, we might've had the salmon, or maybe it was pork... I dunno, I was too drunk.\"" Okay Tony, we didn't buy the book just to hear about your drinking binges... BUT ANYWHOOOO\n\nSo he positively raved about Bouchon, describing it as something every French restaurant should aim to be... just to be sure, I asked my culinary school-graduate cousin if she'd heard of Thomas Keller, and she was quite offended by that actually. I think she muttered something like \""Doh\"" and \""stupid bitch...\""\n\nWell, that was incentive enough for me to make reservations at Bouchon the next time I visited Vegas, and, taking Tony's advice, I ordered the Poulet Roti. That's just a fancy name for Roast Chicken. My bro had the mussels, which came with a huge cone of pommes frites, which is another fancy name for French fries. \n\nMy chicken, as expected, was thoroughly enjoyable. The skin was crispy and delightfully tasty, and the breat was... JUICY! As I sliced into the tender white meat with my knife, I could see trails of juice squishing out of it. So I dumped my knife and fork and dug into my plate with my TEETH. That's how real foodies do it, guys, we use our hands, just as God meant for us to do.\n\nThe mussels were okay... simple white wine/garlic sauce... but it had a sour tang to it! That baffled both my bro and me. Maybe it's how they make their sauce? With an extra squirt of lemon juice? Not our cup of tea, thankyew vewy much. \n\nMmm, I heart the fries. I think they were the star of the meal, being crunchy and uniformly salty. Kinda like McDonald's fries, with less preservatives and a lot fresher. Yum. Fries. Oh yum.\n\nBut in the end I have to take off one star because it was good... but not THAT good, ya know? I dunno, maybe I just need to puff on a few of those cancer sticks and order a couple bottles of their finest wine... then maybe I'll think UMG the food here is outta this world!!!!!"
0,"I really went on an off day I guess based on all of the great reviews this location gets.  We were promptly seated, waited on and served, but after that the waiter just did not ever come over again.  He never offered refills, never offered dessert and when we told him that we were going to order another pizza to bring home with us, he never came back to ask if we wanted to order that.  Meanwhile, he was taking care of other tables.  If they were short handed, shame on them, but at least tell us that. \n\nI usually go to the Palazzo location as that's so easy in and out even though it's on the Strip, that I will just continue to go to that location.  Very disappointing.  \n\nTo me, good service makes the food taste great.  Bad service just ruins everything and that's a shame."
1,Cant complain about the prices if you like fine dining. This place is yummy so i expect to pay a good price for an amazing meal. If you dont like what they serve you tell them. they take great care of their customers. My husband and I went there for our Anniversary and they treated us like royalty. We did go to Costco and got the gift cards at a discounted price. Every bit helps. As we were leaving they took our picture then put it in a cute frame and gave us a Anniversary card and A box of truffles. Seriously who does that? Flemming's did. They have a customer for life with my family
1,"See, when I go to a bowling alley I expect loud and stinky and run down.\n\nThis location though had THE BEST SERVICE I have ever had at a bowling alley.  Likely the best service I have had anywhere in my life.  The man helping was kind, funny, accommodating, fast, ect.  I was really impressed.\n\nThe food was decent.  Was able to order kids meals for the kids and myself.  They didn't care.  Was small portion but tasty and really inexpensive."

1,"Another fantastic experience at Cafe Monarch!    Chris and the team helped provide a memorable experience for a 50th birthday party of 20+ people --- starting with a cocktail reception and hors d'oeuvres in the candle-lit courtyard -- perfect atmosphere.   We moved inside for an exquisite and creative dinner.....with excellent, friendly service.\n\nChris stopped by at several points in the evening to ensure everything was running smoothly and everyone was enjoying the food.   Our guests were all thrilled by the ambience and creative, delicious cuisine.\n\nFor special occasions -- or just a night out to treat yourself, it is hard to beat the Cafe Monarch experience!"
1,"How could I forget to review this place? How can you forget a Lobster Pot Pie that has a whole Maine Lobster? Let's see if we can make this up. \n\nThe Maine Lobster Pot Pie comes out in the All-Clad pot it was baked in topped with a flaky pastry crust. It is then plated table-side by the waiter. He removes the pastry crust from the pot, cuts a perfect circle out, and places it in the center of the plain white dish. He then carefully reconstructs the whole lobster piece by piece minus the head, but with the claw meat which is already shelled. He then adorns the succulent shellfish with pearl onions, baby carrots, parsnips, and potatoes from the pot. It's then finished off with the brandied cream which I dare to say had a hint of truffle. \n\nHow's that for memory? I had that dish about a month ago when all the boys went to Vegas to watch Georges St. Pierre treat BJ Penn like a rag-doll. But I digress. Getting back to the lobster... if memory serves me right, it was @#%in' delicious. I have perpetual \""Entree Envy\"" Syndrome, and for once I can confidently say everyone else had Entree Envy. \n\nAs for everything else the Colorado Lamb has good, but the Rib-eye was almost forgettable. For a high grade dry-aged cut, it didn't live up to its hype. One of the other guys also had the Sucking Pig which was good. We also have a few appetizers, but again I can't remember much about it. \n\nAlthough it's not best to write a review about a restaurant a month and a half after you dine, it does really tell you how memorable it was. A place like Nobhill or any Michael Mina restaurant is more than a meal, it's an experience. And hopefully a memorable one at that. When you look into you memory, you generally remember what was really bad or really good. \n\nTo sum up Nobhill, nothing was bad, most of it was above average, but the Maine Lobster Pot Pie was damn memorable... in a really good way. \n\nMUST TRY: Duh..."
0,I hope there was a good reason for Steve to flake on his appointment for window tinting. Attempted to contact him multiple times with no answer and no return call. Waited in the heat for a half hour outside his shop on Valley View before giving up.
1,"I'm not a big coffee drinker myself - lately I have just been getting iced tea. But a little secret about this place - their gluten free chocolate chip & peanut butter cookies are TO DIE FOR. I seriously crave these little babies all the time. They are so moist, dense and sweet. They taste like cookie dough but they are entirely gluten free! I love that this place is hip and in the middle of the first friday happenings. I can walk here from my apartment, which is an added plus.\nOnly knocking off a star because the seating options are sometimes underwhelming. Definitely more seating than Lola down the street, but sometimes the space is inefficiently used with one person per table. There is always outside seating (but it's so darn hot!)"
0,"\""Airline food\"", that's what my wife equated our dishes it to.  \nThis has to be the worst new opening on the westside in a long time!\nFatty chicken, tracing paper thin cut beef in our combo was less than desirable to say the least.  \n\nSorry Yoshinoya, but you have seen us the one and only time in your resturant."

1,"Tr\u00e8s bon restaurant en plein coeur de Centropolis. \n\nC'est parfait pour partager un repas \u00e0 plusieurs. Tel un restaurant libanais, vous aurez droit \u00e0 diff\u00e9rentes pur\u00e9es que vous pourrez d\u00e9guster avec un pita. Nous avions un plateau pour 2 et c'\u00e9tait suffisant pour 2, si ce n'\u00e9tait m\u00eame pas trop. Donc, si vous avez une petite faim, prenez un plateau pour 2 \u00e0 3 personnes.\n\nDu hummus, de la pur\u00e9e de piments et beaucoup d'autres classiques libanais.\n\nEnsuite, nous avons eu droit \u00e0 un \""plateau de la mer\"" et un \""plateau de la terre\"".

1,"It's easy to see why this small eatery is so popular: the food is inexpensive and tasty, the servings are more than ample, and the range of choices run the gamut of popular Asian cooking styes: Chinese, Japanese, Thai, Mongolian. It's great to be able to order tonkatsu, pad thai, and General Tsao all in one place. While the place could use more light and perhaps a bit of touching up, you come here for the inexpensive, delicious food and not for the decor. I noticed while dining here that they have a very brisk take-out business so don't be surprised if there's a bit of a delay in getting your food if you dine here at peak hours."
1,"Wow ~ what a busy place, especially on a Sunday morning ~ yet even with the rush of people the staff stayed pretty friendly and the food came out quickly.  Einstein Bagels has really stepped up their game ~ they have coffee bar drinks that rivel Starbucks  . . . their latte may actually be better : )  PLUS you can refill your cup with their drip coffee that tasted fantastic.\n\nThey are now featuring new lite and healthy selections featuring bagels that on 1/2 the thickness to save on calories.  I tried their veggie with mushrooms and asparages.  It was terrific!\n\nCompetition is good sometimes ~ in this case having several other breakfast locations in the area has really invited Einsteins to step up and re-invent itself.  It's exciting to see their rebirth and growth.\n\nBlessings : )KC"

1,This was my first time trying this salon. Walked right in and they started my pedicure right away. No complaints and the leg massage was great. I will return. Only bad thing is you get a charge you using a credit card.
0,"Want to see people change clothes??\n\n\nThe actors in this show look very much like the women they portray on stage.  Besides that, I can't really say anything positive about this drag show.  \n\nThe actors lip synch and move about the stage the entire show in their respective costumes.  I would have liked it much more if they were actually singing too.  \n\nFrank Marino, the host is comfortable on stage and charismatic, but his stale jokes feel used up and done to death.  They should really update some of the material, and consider adding some singing to the show.  \n\nI was very bored watching a group of actors wearing different outfits and lip synching.  I wouldn't recommend this show.  \n\nYou like Celine or Cher?  Chances are they're in town, go see them."
0,"This place is far from the best pho experience I've ever had (that is almost a bad pun).  It's really not bad, but there are much better Vietnamese restaurants in Vegas.  The pho broth isn't on the same level as Pho So 1 or Lemongrass Cafe.  For some reason, they were out of bean sprouts and while I don't love them, I've become accustomed to having them in my pho.  Finally, I was a little disappointed that they don't serve tripe in any of their pho variations.\n\nOverall, although I did enjoy the soup, I probably won't return.  I need to try the Jenni Pho place just down the street.  If that doesn't work out, I'll just have to make the extra drive to Chinatown."

0,"I have mixed reviews as well as some of the others. The cabs are clean & environmentally friendly. Our cab driver arrived right on time. I was told he'd call when he was outside, yet he did not. Thank goodness the neighborhood dogs alerted me to his arrival. He didn't seem to know basic street characteristics. I mean, if your cab driver has to make a u-turn because he didn't know he couldn't go left on a major road, that doesn't bode well. \n\nWe asked our driver for his card & if he was available, he said he would pick us up. Well, he said he could pick up us in 20 minutes. Then 30 minutes later, he said he was running 15 minutes late. We were basically stuck at that point. Fortunately, we found an empty cab going our direction after we had waited about 45 minutes. I probably won't be using this company again. Disappointing."
0,Worst Applebees I've ever been to... avoid this location! Head to Native New Yorker instead
0,Salty to the point you can't taste anything else. Dead on a Saturday @ 6:30-we should have known. The waitress showed her face 2 times total & had someone else do all the rest of her work. Appetizers came out well after our actual food. Bad service- horrible food.
0,"Pass. Not the best breakfast or lunch place, by the way they are only open until 3 PM. \n\nThis \""50's style\"" Omelet House is located in a skeezy kind of strip mall on the East side of town off of Desert Inn. My husband and I have driven by it countless times and once we tried to stop and eat here one evening, but then realized it closed at 3 PM. We kept saying we'd go back and try it, so we did when my in-laws were in town.\n\nThe diner itself is run-down. Seats and tables look worn, so does the floor. Their menus are terrible! I mean they're floppy pieces of decaying crap honestly. Seriously, get new menus. \n\nThe omelet selection I must admit IS extensive. I believe there were about 30 different omelets to choose from? My husband had an omelet though, the \""Pigskin\"" and he was not impressed. He said it tasted like fake eggs! I had the cheeseburger with french fries (you can decide between salad, soup, or fries). I thought the burger was nothing special. I asked for grilled onions and they were on the burnt - not grilled - side. My father-in-law got the club sandwich, he didn't say much about it. My mother-in-law got the turkey/guac sandwich. She said the guac had a weird flavor to it (but not spicy). She also had the mushroom soup, which is homemade, she said it was very good. \n\nThe one thing that is redeeming is the fact that the waitress was really, really nice. She gave us samples of their fried potato slices AND got my mother-in-law a sample of the guac before she ordered the sandwich. She was also quick to pick up plates, ask us how everything was.\n\nBut... I doubt I will return. My husband was really not impressed, neither was I."
1,"Simply delicioso! Was looking for some authentic flavors with a home-cooked comfort-food feel and we definitely found that here. Chips and salsa to start- the green salsa was so good that we finished off two baskets of chips before our food even came out.\nRib eye crispy tacos- comes with 2 for an entr\u00e9e. A little greasy but can be good hang over food. The rib eye was very tender and juicy. Yum all around\nChipotle fajita tamales- Definitely get the green sauce. Good vegetarian option- filled with onions, bell peppers, and mushrooms. \nOMG Churros! Sinfully sweet and coated with cinnamon sugar. Served with chocolate and caramel dipping sauces on the side. Perfect way to end your Mexican fiesta meal."
0,"I love car washes and free vacuums. There are two in town I usually go to; one on my way home from class and one on my way to my aunt's house. Both have free vacuums and great car washes.\n\nANYWAYS, I wasn't near either of the two car washes. I was at the Charleston library doing some homework after meeting with a friend. I looked up free vacuums on Yelp and the closest car wash was here, Blondies. Lots of great reviews so I went for it.\n\nI pulled in through the entrance. There's one way in and one way out. I don't think they want people abusing the privilege of free vacuums. I got the second to least expensive car wash. Two guys waved me in, had me put in neutral. Then, they stopped the car wash before my car went forward to remove my antenna. Now, I've never removed my antenna, nor do I know how to remove it (which means I can't put it back on). I've been through PLENTY of car washes, and it's been fine. So now I have to figure out how to put my antenna back on, even though I never asked for it to be taken off.\n\nMy car moves forward, regular car washing things happen. The air dry was so-so, but they do towel dry the outside afterward...which is nice.\n\nI then pulled into the free vacuums. That's the whole point I wanted to go. Free. Vacuums. I like my car very clean. As I got out, a man came from his truck to tell me he works at a car bodyshop and offered to clean my headlights for $40. I told him \""No, thank you,\"" and threw away my garbage. After I threw away some garbage from my car, he comes up to me again, telling me he can fix the chipped paint on my car. Again, I kindly tell him I'm alright. He continues to persist about my car's paint, sun damage, and headlights...asking how low I'll go and that he needs to pay his light bill (isn't it an electric bill?). Kindly, over and over again, I tell him I'm okay. He begs me to come to his truck to look at his work and to get a card. I'm weary at this point as I'm alone. I decline and drive off. Didn't even get to use the vacuum.\n\nDefinitely will not be returning or recommending."
1,"So far my favorite bar in Vegas,  awesome environment,  super cool bartenders, great prices, and live music. Go check it out,  especially Thursday and Friday nights,  open mic,  comedy,  you can't have a better time for the price, also great machines,  very friendly gaming, you'll thank me later"
1,"My sushi loving son and I were on our own on a Sunday night and decided to check out the new Katana Japanese. I'm glad we did.\n\nWe only had sushi, so we'll have to come back to try that hibachi.\n\nWe ordered a Manhattan Roll, a Pink Lady Roll, and a Phoenix Roll.\n\nBefore our rolls were served, the chef offered us a small, complementary plate of tasty treats: four little rolls of peppered, seared tuna wrapped around a little tuft of seaweed. Delicious!\n\nRolls were nicely sized and priced. We've been back, and had similarly tasty Udon soup as well. Still haven't tried hibachi though..."
1,"My wife just loves this place for breakfast. We decided to try it out for dinner. The roasted duck was a bit on the dry side. Had the sauce on the side which wasn't enough to finish my meal and the vegetables was cooked perfectly. My wife's crab cakes were okay and the sweet potato fries were waffle cut and excellent . \nOur waitress was extremely friendly and made sure we had everything we needed. Even the owner stopped by and chatted with us.\nAll in all we thought the meal was a bit pricey, but would definitely be back for breakfast."
0,"The pizza has always been pretty good here. However, we had an AWFUL experience with customer service. Unfortunately, they have now lost our business."
1,"I've now order take out a couple of times from here and GUESS WHAT? They will send you coupons if you order online! What?! BTW, the Indo mac and cheese is amazing."
1,"If you love Paris, you will feel right at home here! Very French! We had a delightful lunch on the patio, well protected from a brief rain. I had the lobster special, pre-shelled and served cold with a light dijonaise  on the side, with points flutes. The salad too was crisp with a light vinaigrette. Well worth it!"
0,"Overwhelming... Crap everywhere. They look like they went to auctions. Priced stuff for TV and then threw it in this place. A lot of the stuff was way overpriced. I didn't even really find anything I wanted cause I actually would have tried to negotiate. Not sure if they would go for it but worth the try. They got everything here from Tvs to umbrellas to dishes bikes tents. Didn't see any furniture, primary household stuff. Got s lot of bikes outside but not in the greatest condition for the price. Rather pay a little more and get a new one."
0,"I try to like you Postinos, I really do but you make it so hard.  Came on a Tuesday for their 8 PM $20 Bottle of wine and bruschetta special and left disappointed and annoyed.\n\nThe parking lot disaster strikes again!  LGO now put up signs saying 25 min parking for LGO customers only and has a lot monkey stationed to chase away people trying to park in those spaces.  I was told by the lot monkey that I could valet ($3 charge) or I could park 3 blocks away if I didn't want to pay the fee.  Keep in mind this is a Tuesday and I have to pay to park my car because the restaurant blocks off all the spaces.\n\nOnce seated my friend and I tried to catch up for a moment when the server came over to take our drink orders.  Since we had just sat down we asked for some time to take a look at the menu.  Our server came back a few minutes later and asked if we were ready to order.  No suggestions on a wine, no questions if we had questions, just \""you ready to order?\""\n\nWe ordered a bottle and bruschetta and our waiter disappeared.  For the rest of the night.  I watched him refill wine glasses at other tables, ours was brought by another server.  Other tables had their plates cleared when they were finished, ours sat in front of us until another server took them away.  Our server obviously didn't want our business because about an hour after we sat down he came back to the table and asked if we were interested in any dessert.  We said no and he immediately dropped the check on the table and left.  No offer of another round of drinks, just here is your check.\n\nThe wine we had was amazing and was a steal at the price plus the bruschetta.  The bruschetta themselves were half assed.  3 of the 4 weren't even sliced all the way through but over all they were decent.\n\nYet again Postinos shows they want my money but not my patronage.  I don't understand how I am the only one who keeps having horrible experiences here?"
1,"Eric got my engagement ring from here and I could have never asked for a more beautiful ring!! I love it to death! It is absolutely perfect with such high quality diamonds. The princess cut looks so classy and i love how it contrasts with the round diamonds that surround the band. We came here to resize my ring and look at possible wedding bands. I wanted to buy his band myself, so the staff was on a mission to find the style I he was looking for. I decided to go with another source for our bands but Shane Co was very friendly and helpful with any service or product I was interested in. They resized it for free and gave my ring a deep clean when I picked it up a few days later."
1,I love getting my nails and toes done here. They always make me laugh and have great conversations with me!
1,"Outside of the Good Humor man this was my first experience with a food truck. I was quite delighted. I had the Big Easy Balls, Andoulle sausage risotto and a few other things all balled together and deep fried, and topped with a dipping sauce (I will add a picture), what could go wrong? Nothing, I will be on the look out for this truck again. I also want to mention how nice the staff is. I say be on the lookout for this truck and give it a try. Live it up you are in Las Vegas for cryin' out loud!"
0,Do not waste your money . Sabrett dogs are old. Nothing is fresh.. The pizza taste frozen and we tried them AGAIN ... one more time after we were turned off last year .. still poor customer service and cleanliness...
1,"Oh how I love a good breakfast place close to my house for those weekend mornings when I just want some delicious food without the hassle of making it and cleaning up. And Eddie's definitely fits that criteria; conveniently located in Cotswold, their breakfast is solid every time. We've been to Eddie's quite a bit, and tend to hit it up at least once on weekends when we have quests in town. \n\nIf you're going to try to go during peak breakfast hours on the weekend, be ready for a wait as they offer $4.00 mimosas and bloody mary's (made with zing zang, which is the best bloody mary mix available). The tables turn pretty quickly, but the place just isn't that big. Service is generally very good, and we've never had to ask for drink refills. \n\nEddie's generally has pretty good breakfast specials, and if you like coffee, it's a-ok. The omelets, french toast and pancakes are all very good. And they offer turkey sausage and great hash browns to round out your breakfast experience. \n\nIf you're in the area, give Eddie's a try!"
1,"Adored my visit here!  \nLush, peaceful and aromatic grounds.  Such a fabulous place to meditate and enjoy solitude. \nI bought some olive oil, cured Kalamata olives and bread in the gift shop.  A very kind Greek woman assisted me in picking out items for purchase by showing me which her favorites were.  She also suggested the honey but I had just purchased a large qty of honey so I declined.  \nThis is an amazing place and the dedication of the monks to continue the cleanliness and beauty is apparent."
0,"Not a good experience with my recent visit to yoshinoya. The rice bowl and veggies were greasy and unflavorful. The cooks might be using some cheap oil to cook their rice bowls with. Also, if you ask for some hot sauce or pepper your gonna get charged .70. The clam chowder that came with my rice bowl tasted better than the rice bowl and that is not saying much. The clam chowder was too watery and not one single clam in the cup. Also, the restaurant had a funky smell. Also, the floor was dirty and the restroom was very dirty. I hate to sound negative but the yoshinoya management needs to read this review. This restaurant needs some major changes fast if they wish to stay in business."
1,"Lux. If you've tried their coffee, pastries, or other assorted goodies then you are likely  a believer. Yes they are are always busy. You will likely have to wait in some sort of line, depending on when you go. Your patience will be rewarded by your taste buds singing praise for a job well done. Most of their drinks tend to run less sweet (which isn't a bad thing) but they provide a variety of sweetener options to enhance the flavor to your preference.\n\nI recommend picking up coffee beans if you have a grinder, or alternatively, I believe they can grind it for you.  This is truly a gem in Phoenix and without a doubt, my favorite coffee joint."
0,This food was beyond average. They obviously have high rent so the food is high priced. I would not eat here again. I really do not get the high praise of this chef. I would rather go across the street and eat at chipotle. ewwww
1,"Lovely meal! \n\nIt's been so long since we ate here that we cannot remember what we had, but we remember the owner being a doll and the food was divine! \n\nLocal. Small. Fantastic. \n\nGo, you!"
0,"Decent food (had the breakfast burrito, which was delightfully pressed on the grill and crispy), great location, but some of the worst live music I've ever heard in my life, right up there with some wedding reception noise!  The restaurant was full and ONE person, an employee who seemed to be the singer's girlfriend, applauded.  Dead silence from everyone else.  For several songs.  It was really bad.  I actually had the waiter change my order to takeout, but thankfully the \""musician\"" packed up soon after that.  The poor server apologized, and said they're working on the noise level, but I think they need to look at the talent level instead.  If I hear/see that awful LOUD caterwauling they call live entertainment again when I enter here, I will immediately turn around and leave.\n\nThis experience was actually from my second time in the restaurant.  My first time I walked in I was ignored, there was no one at the hostess stand area, and there was a bored looking waitress rolling silverware and pretending I wasn't looking at the menus.  I walked out after a bit.\n\nTwo strikes means I've yet to go back, since Los Tacquitos on 16th Street and Glendale is just as close, much faster, and the women working there (owners?) give great customer service.  Their quality probably isn't as high as Otro, but neither are their prices."
0,"Sure you get to see some ( . Y . ), but all they did was dance. I could have gone to a strip club and pretty much have seen the same thing, but only cheaper and see some full frontal nudity.\n\nThere were no themes. The stage was small and their heads almost hit the ceiling. This ain't no Moulin Rouge. I actually did enjoy Moulin Rouge. Click here: http://www.yelp.com/biz/moulin-rouge-paris#hrid:QoQl64Y1GSvn9H_tn5sVYg. But over here at the Crazy Horse at the MGM, there were no acrobats, no jumping or flying or extravagance in entertainment.\n\nI fell asleep pretty much throughout most of the show, either due to boredom or maybe I was drunk. Either way, I still did manage to see some of the show and still I wasn't entertained. Somehow, when the performers look at the audience, it just seems they are staring at you. I don't know how they do it, but it's weird, wherever you are sitting, they are literally staring at you. Pretty cool, yet pretty freaky.\n\nI did like the intermission when two male performers were dancing in sync. Pretty funny acts, and pretty cool stunts and dance show. \n\nBut other than that, the performances by the rest of the cast was mediocre at best, just a cleaner version of a strip club. The only difference is that I paid $69 to get in, and I fell asleep. But at least I don't have that lingering stripper smell. \n\nI don't know; if you haven't seen a show like this, then yah, it's worth going out to see it at least once. For $69 (or less if you find some really good deals), it's still pretty cheap compared to the other shows in Vegas. I also got half bottle of the champagne for $43. I think the champagne helped me get through this 1 hour and 15 minute show."
1,"This is one of my favorite Italian restaurants that reminds me a lot of the little Italian family style restaurants you can find in little Italy and other places around NYC. I come here about 3-4 times a month to get my Italian fix:) The staff is super friendly and treats you like your family. The owner, Richard, is often there and loves to talk so get ready for a great conversation about the history of the restaurant etc!  Its a very small restaurant and seating is limited. I personally like sitting inside because its warm and cozy! There is outside seating but it looks out onto a shopping center parking lot which to me is not appealing to me at all. The food here is AMAZING! Portions are quite large and can easily be spit in half to share. They have been on the TV show Diner, Drive-ins and Dives, which is where I got my motivation to make the drive over there. I would recommend the calamari to start and/or the bruschetta, which offers 4 choices of toppings. For the main course I always get the Spagetti Neri, which is squid ink pasta with a TON of seafood. If you like seafood this is definitely the dish for you! The Bolognese is also an excellent choice. To top it off at the end of my meal I like to take a conolli, which is always made fresh and oh so yummy!"
0,"Disapointment! Honestly can't say anything good about the place. \n\nThe food was bad, even for a buffet. Most of the juice machines where down. Fruit wasn't ripe. How do mess up fried chicken and mashed potatoes. On top of all that, most of the ladels had food on them so my hands were left sticky and gross. On top of that, it was over priced."
0,"You pay $36 for a drink that's all ice because of the cool cup, and they don't let you keep it.  Total scam.  $100 for a lunch is ridiculous."
0,"This place doesn't receive a star. I came into the store, going to order an iPhone 6. The next night I look at my receipt and are they ordered the iPhone 6 Plus. Called the customer service line and couldn't find my order. Called the store couldn't find it either. Then asked for a manager and he finally found it. He was extremely rude and hung up. I believe his name was Jim. Now my phone is coming 2 weeks later than before. Trying to get it as a birthday present, but what a bummer. Don't go to this location EVER. Don't have very good customer service and don't care. Spent a good 3 hours on on little mistake."
0,Went to container park to try new bites.....so sad that this was not what we were hoping for. Sliders were lack luster decent flavor beef but onion marmalade didn't really taste like anything. The Mac n cheese again not anything to rave about and quite pricey for such a small little bowl. I hope they read these reviews and do a little tweek. I'll give them a second chance just not for awhile.
1,Hey I love this place. I have had nothing but great experiences here. They always get me in super fast and do an excellent job. The gas station owner - yeah he's an ass but I find that to be a part of his charm.  The rest of the employees are pretty cool for people that work day in and day out at a gas station.
0,"Ok I have to apologize to Julie T if you're reading this, I'm sorry! Don't be mad at me! I lied to you, I said I liked it.  I was probably one of the last in Vegas to try their pizza but I had heard such negative reviews from people I had no desire. But the opportunity came up when my friend and her bf (this is his fav place) invited me, so of course I accepted. Anyways...immediate 1 star for patio seating (and I love love love the white Xmas type lights hanging from the lattice) and for it being Tuesday tasting (half of glasses of wine) I did enjoy my wine. No stars for food.\n\nThe pizza looked decent when it came out. Nice big bubbly pieces of cheese, fresh basil on top, looks good?! Well my friend had told me that the ricotta was sweet, I wasn't quite prepared for the taste of it. I wasn't down with sweet ricotta on my pizza. The sauce had no flavor, at least the pepperoni gave it some. I asked the server for a side of ranch \""we don't serve ranch, our pizza doesn't need it\"" uh huh, I beg to differ. This is for corporate pizza lovers who don't know any better.  Once again, to each their own, but I will never return."
1,"Breakfast food is my favorite type of food. Square cafe is one of my favorite breakfast places. Really good food. Generally good service. They seem to always have interesting specials. The place is pretty big, and has a lot of outdoor seating. \n\nI have had several breakfast items, and really enjoy their savory items, like the Veggie Omelet, but I think they are really good at the sweet items. French toast sticks with a caramel sauce was a special once, and they were AMAZING. I also really appreciate their special options, as they always offer something different and good.  Their coffee is pretty good too.\n\nWill and have been back and its a place to take friends."
0,Definitely not a NY style pizza. Not even close. Try Buonos much better. Have eaten here a few times with co-workers and all items are pretty crappy. Today I had the baked Ziti and the bread looked as if it was scorched by a flame thrower. Black and hard - GROSS. I will not be ordering again.
1,"Very good place to go for a quick healthy meal. Even though it is a salad buffet, they also have soups, breads, and on different days extra dishes like spaghetti or tacos. For about $8.00 you can get the buffet and a drink. The bar is always very clean and the staff is always friendly. They even have a \""Souper Fresh Club\"" you can sign up for and get coupons and discounts via email, a $5.99 coupon is what i get the most. I would recommend anyone to Souper Salad."
0,"I hate to say it, but this mall is kind of ghetto. The layout is somewhat bizarre, and depending on which side you enter, you'd never know about the other side if you didn't look at a map and just decide to wander. The stores are really nothing special and if you seek high end stores, you're better off hitting the strip. What's really weird is the women's stores in there--they're either plus sizes, clubby looking stuff, or outright hooker uniforms. There is also a Macy's, JC Penny and Sears. Three stores I never buy anything from anyway. There is, however, a Cinnabon, and I LOVE Cinnabon...."
0,Meh... forgetful chain food... would like to give extra half star for the free peanuts.. and free rolls...
1,"Over the last 20 years I've eaten breakfast all over Vegas. Blueberry Hill is the best for down home best pancakes, omelettes, crepes, biscuits & gravy... all that stuff. Went here with my sons & brother and we ordered just about everything we saw (6 entrees) and shared it all. There was nothing average or yucky. Good quality ingredients (I heard its all from scratch) and the service was great. The diner atmosphere is awesome too. \nIf you frequent Vegas, give this place a try if you're near. It's worth it!!"
1,"I llike this place. I've heard it called the Subway version of Mexican food, which is pretty true. You get in line and order your basic item (burrito, tacos, other things) then customize it as you sidestep down the counter. One thing to remember: you get a lot of food. Last time I got a burrito and ate the whole thing and regretted it. Not because it wasn't good, but because I was like a python that had eaten a wildebeest. \n\nThe food isn't fancy, but I don't think it's any worse than Pedro's, and for a lot less money. Also, you can drink beer! I love a fast-food place where I can booze it up. \n\nThe people who work there tend to be a mellow bunch, which I also like."
1,"What a great visit! I've been driving by this plaza for quite a long time now and an impromptu date night led us to finally give West End Bar & Grill a try. Boy am i glad we did! \n\nNestled in a back corner of the lot behind Goodwill, it's definitely off the beaten track. You can't see it from the street, you have to pull in to the lot and head to the southeast corner of the back lot. And don't let the golf carts out front fool you--this place is BIG, FUN, and not just for the Geriatric crowd of Sun City West!\n\nWe enjoyed the wings for an appetizer. The wings were big and meaty with a nice crunchy coating.  I enjoyed the Veggie sandwich which was a portabello mushroom sandwich with mozzarella cheese and mixed greens on flat bread. It had a great pesto and balsamic dressing as well. It was EXCELLENT. My husband had the special which was a taco salad with a FREE margarita or beer. He had the marg. The taco salad was just the right size, fresh, and plenty meaty. We also had dessert--a lemon bar sundae. Everything was really very good. \n\nOur server was friendly, interesting, and not intrusive at all. The other staff members were also friendly as well when they worked near our table, checking on us and removing plates as needed.  \n\nI am really looking forward to going back to West End. This place is a diamond in the rough here in Surprise and supporting small, local businesses whenever possible is what I'm all about!"
1,Will come back in September definitely enjoyed the drinks...
0,"Pros\nI didn't get sick!!\n\nCons\nThe \""Food\""\n\nWhile in Las Vegas my wife, 10 month old daughter, and I decided to try the Rainforest Cafe located in the MGM Grand. We all enjoyed the decor, the service was so so, but the food was absolutely disgusting. We started things off with 2 waters and a diet coke and ordered the \""Awesome Appetizer\"". All the food on the platter (2 chix strips, 2 chimmi cha cha's ,crab dip, and calamari) was cold except the crab dip which was piping hot. One thing I don't understand is the chix strips and calamari where both very lightly cooked almost underdone but the chimi cha cha (similar to a chili's southwestern eggroll) was overcooked and really dark. Having worked in a restaurant for a few years I knew this was from using old fry oil that had gone too long without filtration or replacement, it causes a burnt crust with an almost smoky/bitter taste and an undercooked center.\n\nFor our main dishes I had ordered a cobb salad and my wife had the \""Rasta Pasta\"". My salad was also pretty bad, a good portion of the lettuce was wilted. It was also pretty clear that they didn't take the time to dry the lettuce after washing it. The wet lettuce couldn't hold onto the dressing which caused a pool of water/dressing to form in the bottom of my bowl. My wifes pasta wasn't as disgusting, but it wasn't good either. The chicken was tolerable but overall the whole dish was dry and bland.\n\nThe total bill for our meal came to just over $70 which is way to much for the quality of the food. After 11 nights in Las Vegas this is by far the worst place we ate at, I have no idea why the MGM Grand would allow the restaurant in it's casino.  It's a shame I have to give this place even one star which is one more than it deserves."
0,"I don't really get how people can think this is somewhere amazing, it's really only alright. The food is good, yeah, but not for the price. It's way too expensive.\n\nIt's be ok for treating yourself once in a while or for going to lunch with friends but it's not somewhere I'd make a habit of frequenting. The beer-hall style seating is a bit weird as well, I know a lot of people are into it but it's not really my sort of thing."
1,"I only give four stars unless it is a Michelin rated restaurant...al Lago is that good!\n\nWe have dined at al Lago many times since they opened last year. We have never been disappointed. Even with a group of 8 with ages ranging from 8 to 80, al Lago was exceptional.\n\nWith a vegetarian and a meatatarian in our household, we  often have trouble finding restaurants that work for both of us. They do, and they do it well."
1,Food here is not very great... The chicken tastes like the processed frozen chicken you can get from the supermarket. \n\nBut this is the best place in Charlotte for NFL games! Get there early so you can get a table. And the bloody Mary bar is awesome!
1,"I fell in love with this place as soon as we pulled up and saw the lights strung up and  oldies coming from the speakers! \n\nI tried the banana cream pie hard ice cream, their scoops are very generous!! \n\nMy bf got the peach cobbler hard ice cream and that was to die for! We got 4 servings of ice cream for $10, which nowadays is a steal IMO! :) \n\nI'll definitely be heading back with my coworkers this week!"
0,"Well this is my first less than flattering review. I bought some soup and it had large noodles that seemed to be the ones that stick to the top of the pot when you boil them, It wasn't cooked, it was still hard. But the cook didn't care. Well I do. 4 times I have been there and 4 times a problem. They need a cook that cares, because when she saw the uncooked noodle and served it to me, She mush have thought It didn't matter. well it did. Not a very good place to eat. They need to get rid of cooks that are not into their work. No wonder when I drive by it's usually empty tables. Sorry to have to communicate this, I tried and gave the benefit of the doubt. But after 4 fails. I won't be coming back. And get rid of the guy with the baseball cap and dirty t shirt hanging around the kitchen, that doesn't look good to a customer."

I've experienced better\"" couldn't be any more dead on for this place, *especially* in light how many best.pizza.ever reviews i've seen on here and from noted chefs and celebrities. for all of you who think that, i'm sorry but maybe you've never been to new york. hell, maybe you've never even been to new jersey, b/c this wasn't any better than my local neighborhood joint. based on what i read coming into the meal, i expected the light of god to shine down on me as i took my first bite. what i got instead was, yes, an ok pizza, but nothing more than and a ridiculously overcharged one at that (and now an awful case of heartburn, but that's beside the point).\n\nwe got the margherita pizza and added wood-roasted mushrooms and sicilian anchovies. sauce was pretty good but the house made mozzarella was nothing to write home about. crust was thin and soft in the middle, crispy around the edges...and burnt. luckily, my wife and i don't mind a well-done crust, but it certainly did not exhibit the perfection that i was expecting going in. the pizza was cut into 6 slices, and was so small that i could have easily eaten the thing on my own. couldn't have been more than 10-12\"" in diameter, as each slice was able to *easily* fit on the same appetizer-sized plates that we used for our pre-pizza bread (which we had to request, was not offered to us by the waiter, yet another knock against the entire experience).\n\nthe total bill for one little pizza and a $5 draft beer was $28. that's right, one pizza, no more than a personal-sized one at that, with 2 toppings was $23. in terms of accompaniments to the pizza, the menu was SO limited and when i saw the table next to us get their antipasto plate, there was no way we were paying $15 for it.\n\ni cannot believe that anyone in their right mind would wait one hour, let alone up to 4 as some of you have written, for this pizza. maybe zagat should stick to fine dining reviews, b/c they clearly missed the mark here. if any of my friends or relatives were to visit phoenix, my advice would be \""don't believe the hype\"". personally, i can't wait to get back to new jersey and get a bigger, cheaper, and most importantly, better pizza."
1,Great for after pita jungle. Just what this plaza needed. Lots of flavors and clean!
1,"It's a bit past 9pm on a Saturday night and I call Xinh Xinh to see if they're still open.  I've never been, but I'd heard good things, and I had a hungry crew of people from out of state to take care of.  Closing at 9:30?  We can make it...\n\nGood thing I did call, because they were about to close up shop early for the night.  It's a small place owned and run daily by one guy (Shai), so it's a forgivable practice.  Just make sure you call ahead if it's near closing time.\n\nWe felt a bit embarrassed coming in, but Shai made us feel completely welcome and we never felt rushed at any point in the night.  Since we were also the last patrons of the night, he took the time to make sure we were satisfied and chatted with some of my friends who from his home state of California.\n\nI've had a lot of pho in my time, but the broth here was much more flavorful than any other place I had been.  The meat balls weren't as dense as I'd have liked (that's what she said), but overall everyone was happy with their soup.  My one sick friend said she felt considerably better once she finished, so yay pho!\n\nProtip: they take credit cards and are open Sundays now.  Shai mentioned a Sunday special on Pho, though I don't know if it was just that Sunday or every Sunday."
1,"Amazing food selection, its big & fresh & cheap.  There's no better place in Madison for fresh vegetables"
1,great fresh food! huge egg roll! i would recommend this place to anyone! i get the kung pow and sweet sour chicken both are great!
0,"horrid service, cold, bland tasteless food.  the sausage gravy was so disgusting!"
1,"Awesome place for a premium burger, beer and fries! Black and blue burger medium rare is must.\n\nClassic bar and grill layout. The server was incredible friendly and competent. \n\nChatted with the owner and his daughter who manages the place. Both are very relaxed, funny and nice. Mr \""Dotty\"" was a bit of a character.\n\nGreat location near the campus. Definitely a keeper on the Madison short list."
0,"Yikes!   Illinois native tries SnS in Tempe and is totally disgusted.  \nIf you grew up eating with your family at Steak N Shake restaurants across the mid west you are going to be terribly disappointed.  No Chili Mac?!  and the Fries are now fresh cut with the skin left on (what, what... are they trying to copy another chain?). The hamburger has zero flavor...where is the mid west corn fed beef.  Oh and you forgot to smash the burger down and cook it period... nevermind you forgot the little crispy ends???   Is this really a Steak N Shake. Even my chocolate shake was sub par and icy.  The one thing that stayed true to the taste was the Chili but, ya know all those kids had to do was open a can. TWO THUMBS DOWN.  If you can't stay classic to your origins don't do it at all.  I think Mr Belt is rolling over in his grave as I type this."
0,Something was wrong with the produce - burgers made me and my kid sick. Awesome milkshakes though. Fries were average. Good atmosphere and friendly service. Wish we ate somewhere else.
1,"A lot better than Panda Express. Ordered the regular size dark meat chicken rice bowl and it was so good. I love the teriyaki suace and made sure to ask for extra! The regular size is a perfect portion to fill you up and they aren't skimpy on food. It's nice to find a clean, fast, and delicious teriyaki joint. We will be back."
1,"Like going home.   I was raised in New York and I know deli.   This place is the real deal.  Great breakfasts, terrific soup and amazing sandwiches.   The breads are fresh and everything tastes like home!   We came back three times while in Vegas even though we had to drive clear across the city.  Warm, wonderful owners who are still excited about their trade.    Just go!"
1,"When you get tired of the crowds of Amalie's, check out Nova's Bakery.  Their pastries are delicious and their hot drinks are great.  They also have great fresh bread, a large wall of whole-bean coffee, and lots of interesting wine.  Plus it's 24/7 which is perfect for folks like me who work unconventional hours."
1,"The Smash Fries were heavenly, rosemary and olive oil. \n\nBurger was great. A little greasy, which I like. Topping choices were good."
0,"I've been in Charlotte for almost a month now, and have only experienced one great disappointment: that there are only two dim sum restaurants in the entirety, AND that they're both half an hour away from me. Why, Dim Sum? Why?\n\nNow it seems besides the Dragon Court (which doesn't seem to be wowing people either), the Dim Sum Chinese Restaurant is all I have left. Le sigh. \n\nAlright, lament aside and review on, this place did not dress to impress. Outside looked pretty sketch, and upon walking in there, the cook and what looked like the manager were sitting down watching tv. They seemed to be able to afford the down time because there wasn't a soul in the house. I waited awkwardly by the counter, then said, \""Excuse me,\"" three times to no avail. Then suddenly, for some reason, the chef looked up, barked something and a waitress came out with my order.\n\nFirst things first: if you are a full-time Dim Sum restaurant, you need to have some staples that come with availability. All sweet items are done ONLY on weekends. This includes the custard tarts, coconut rolls, fried pineapple rolls, ANYTHING that resembles a dessert, and one of the biggest staples of dim sum and one of my personal favorites, zha leung cheung fun, also known as Chinese fried dough wrapped in rice noodle. I know how this may sound, but for those of you who have experienced a good zha leung cheung fun, you know what I'm talkin'bout. \n\nThat taken off my order, I almost decided to wait for the weekend, BUT I was only 15 out of the thirty minutes away in a car with no air conditioning - I may as well tough the damn thing out. Also up on the list: pork and shrimp dumplings, fried shrimp balls, and chicken feet. \n\nThis is my usual dim sum test. Something I like and is easy (dumplings), something I hadn't tried before (shrimp balls), and... the feet. You can always tell how good a dim sum place is going to be by their chicken feet. In this case, the chicken feet were cooked moderately well, but had no seasoning whatsoever and what little sauce there was was very bland. The meat in the dumplings tasted good, but had an odd texture of not ground, but pureed. It took me a couple to get used to it. The shrimp balls were huge, and delicious. However, the outside was soggy instead of the crunchy I was hoping for. \n\nAll in all, hoping for a better dim sum experience. Now all I can do is place my hope in the Dragon Court. Wish me luck."
1,"There was a time when I judged Chop Shop. If you went to Chop Shop when it first opened you might have noticed that it didn't have the best sound quality. Friends, that has changed. They fixed whatever was wrong. \n\nThis might be my favorite venue in Charlotte. That is a strange thing to say considering the awkward paintings of half naked women and sometimes the ridiculously long line to get inside (it always seems to take forever to pay and show ID there)\n\nHowever, the sound is excellent. There are 2 stages. It is small. It is intimate. It isn't trying to be more than what it is.  The drinks are good. There is a small outdoor area.\n\nThis is how I like to see shows.\n\nOh- and Wolf Blitzer and Anderson Cooper gave a shout out to Chop Shop on CNN. We are making it big time, kids."
1,"Great pizza for takeout. Love the veggie pizza and the meat lovers. Great crust, sweet tomato sauce. They are not skimpy on the toppings. Garlic knots were really really good. I also really loved the chicken wings with the hot sauce....my lips felt it for a while.\n\nFor take out and very decent prices (well at least compared to San Francisco prices) you cannot beat Biaggio's"
0,"Too many restaurant gaffes in one night. Forgotten drinks, dry fish, cold tacos that needed to be reheated, lemons instead of limes, that sort of thing. Meh."
1,"Funny dude, had some cool magic tricks. I was really hoping to see some CRAZY SHXT like POOF a big axx whale appears and then BAM and elephant walks out of the whales mouth. Something like that would have made my day."
0,"As promised, stopped by last week again. \nSat @ the lounge, ordered an iced tea (they only have green tea, BTW). \nGrabbed a menu, only to recall the dish's name, but I was ready to make a run @ the duck. Placed my order and kicked back to watch some NBA action on the tv. About 7-10min later the waitress came back and said that they had run out of duck and asked if there was something else. I said \""No\"", as I specifically came in for the dish. That is IT! Officially off the restaurant option list in Vegas. They just can not figure out how to run a restaurant. There are so many sushi options in Vegas, that pushing sashimi and nigiri @ $4/piece will not work. They do not have the high end foot traffic @ Mirage any more and from what I see between menu and service; they have maybe a year or less and they are DONE."
0,"I was able to make an appointment for a 2-hour time slot the next day and received a reminder email that I would be called 30-15 min before my appointment to confirm the time.  No way to get an estimate or price beforehand.  Didn't receive the reminder call, so I called 30 min later and they checked and said they'd be there in 30 min.  They arrived and were polite but the price was too high.  I had a washing machine, 10 boxes of ceramic tile and one garbage bag and they first quoted $161.  They offered a $25 off coupon and that was still too high.  Then they wanted to know if I would do it for their lowest price of $125.  They said they usually charge $125 for a washer removal.  Although they were polite, their appointment execution wasn't that great and I thought the pricing was way too expensive."
1,"The $5 pizzas in the bar area are awesome awesome!  Thin crusted, great toppings, large for $5!\n\nPlus the Chicken Parm sliders are only $3!!\n\nYou can eat here for under $10 for a couple.  We love this place!!!"
1,"All around great food.. the burgers, the sushi, the appetizers are delicious! I definitely recommend the tuna tar tar app and the nachos! Great drinks list and fun bar scene. This place is also really nice in the summer because it has a big back porch."
1,"Salad bar was surprisingly good as a side item. I also got the baked mac and cheese and wished I had more when it was gone. Nice staff, clean restaurant and good food. Price isn't terrible for what you get."
1,"We had lunch at  Joyride yesterday. Absolutely amazing. Fabulous service, fun atmosphere and the tacos were off the charts. I had the Carne Asada, chicken Tinga and Ahi tuna tacos. All were amazing but my favorite was the Chicken Tinga. \n\nI would highly recommend this spot. I will certainly be returning soon."
1,"This is a good farmers market!  Focus is on food and includes only a few craft booths. Saw, and purchased a nice variety of fruits and vegetables that went beyond the normal fare offered in local grocery stores.  In addition to fruits and vegetables, saw booths specializing in: honey, salsa, tamales, nuts, breads, baked goods, beauty products, and on-site meals, among others.  A couple of booth merchants had the distinction of having earned \""Best of Phoenix\"" awards including the tamale merchant.  My wife and I each tried a tamale and they were excellent!  Another merchant was selling creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e which was delicious!  Overall, the prices are above average, but I would say that the quality of products are above average and you get what you pay for.  If nothing else, visiting this market is a nice relaxing activity for a Saturday morning."
1,Had lunch here today. The salad I had was crisp and fresh. The chicken had a great taste. The portions were very good. \nThe place was clean. The service was fine. \nFor fast food and selection we will be back.
1,"Staying in town with some friends and read a few reviews on Helen's. Decided to try it and from the moment we walked in, I felt like I had been coming in for years. Lupe the hostess was so nice and told us everything about the menu and even gave advice about where to watch the Bronco game while in town. \nNow about the food, Orange juice was big enough to serve 3 people and at iHop this would have been 12 - 15 $$$. The portions are big enough to share and they will let you replace pancakes for toast and biscuits and gravy etc.. Anything we asked for was perfectly fine with them and made quick work of it. If you live here or are in town, stop at this pace because it's worth it! It's not fancy so if your looking for 5 star hotel food with oatmeal at $14 bucks a bowl, this is not your place. If you're looking for a killer comfort breakfast place with super nice people and killer prices, this is it! \nEnjoy."
1,Great chicken fingers! Sauce is delish and lemonade is the best.
1,"This is my \""go to\"" Costco for all of my needs.  It's the closest to my home, and I'm here on a regular basis to get all sorts of things.\n\nI love Costco for all same reasons everyone else does.  This location is like all the others in the Valley-ample parking, good hours, free samples on Saturdays, and of course, the hot dogs.  I get one every time I'm here! \n\nI also like Costco because now they have their coupons loaded onto the membership card when you check out.  I found this out a while ago, when I picked stuff up that was on special, and the discount came right off at the register, without me having to whip out any coupons.  Makes life easier when you forget stuff like that, or when your stopping in and forget to bring the coupons with you.\n\nOverall I like it here, easy in easy out, and the staff is always friendly and helpful.\n\nMy only complaint about Costco as a whole, is that I find some of their selection limited.  No name brand cat food, (Kirkland brand only), no 40 ounce Nivea in a blue bottle (they carry the skin firming crap in the white bottle, but I don't use it...I use the regular lotion in the blue bottle.)  They used to carry this stuff years ago, but since I've become a member again, it seems thier stock has somewhat changed, and I'm kinda dissapointed about it.\n\nOverall, Costco rules, and I love shopping here.  Always on my short list of places to stop for just about anything!"
1,"This is your typical hostel. You can get single/double rooms, or stay in the super cheap 6 person rooms. This place is pretty sound proof and had no problems sleeping. There is a bar downstairs with super nice bartenders there to answer any questions til midnight at least normally.\n\nThey also have a shuttle service that will drop off and pick you up at any nearby stations and sometimes the tourist destinations if they're not busy and in a good mood. Which is helpful as its out on the edge of town. We had not one issue here and had a great time! We met a lot of new friends too. There was lots of room to socialize if you wanted to, and room to be by yourself if that was your preference."
0,Pretty ok rooms were very nice. Fast elevators spacious parking garage or get your car valet for no extra. They just need to do a better job with there confirmations they messed up  my grandmothers room reservations so she had to bunk with someone else they admitted they made the mistake but couldn't do anything for her do to the hotel was full sucks. Then they messed up on all of our free breakfast deals smh n e who. Word to the wise confirm if your going here confirm confined confirm make sure you get peoples names you talk to on the phone and then call back at a diffrent time and talk to someone else and ask them about the details of your reservation. It shouldn't be this hard but its whatever now but I will definitely research more hotels before coming back.
0,"My family went in to eat on a Sunday night after eating at other My Big Fat Greek Restaurants in the valley. We were seated right away but we waited about twenty minutes to get our drinks and another thirty minutes to get our appetizer. We asked for our daughters sake if we could have her food first after the appetizer and that did not occur. We got our food and it tasted great but when we asked for extra toppings they never brought them. When we were all done we waited and waited for a check. We asked three different people for it including the manager and he gave us the wrong one. They were not busy so I have no idea what was going on. I know we will not return to this location due to their service, the food was great but their service was bad."
0,"I know, I know.  Everyone in Pittsburgh is all into Pamela's breakfast.  But I just don't get it.  I don't like my pancakes crepe thin and extra greasy.  And I really don't like the crispy, crunchy edges.  That's pretty nasty to me.  And the lyonnaise potatoes, while good, are just potatoes.  My friend had an omelet that looked pretty good.  And I'll admit, I stole half a slice of his toast.  I'll probably go back, because it's a good location and the service and decor were both good.  But I'm not going to lose any sleep waiting to go back or craving this stuff....."
1,"There are only a few things one needs to know. Ahem...\n\nThey make a lot of bread, so they're good at it. Yet despite fancy names, the bread will taste like most good bread you've ever had.\n\nThe sandwiches are all around $10. They're pretty filling, and if you choose the right one, it can be split.\n\nThere are free samples at the register!\n\nIt's totally not at all creepy to longingly stare through the windows in the back at the bakers plying their trade. Not creepy at all."
0,"Eh, not impressed at all.  Neither was my wife.  The menus is rather small (which, I guess you expect from a gastropub) and the range of food we ordered left a lot to be desired.  The Kobe burger was rather disgusting---I only ate half of it.  The service was great; the decor was wonderful; but the experience just didnt' do it for me.\n\nFor that price, we should have gone to L'Atelier next door."
1,"Located a bit off of the Fremont Street, downtown, in a hipster area, O Face Doughnuts is a culinary delight in terms of doughnuts. The flavor combinations are exciting and inventive, even more so than the other fancy doughnut spots I've patronized. They take their recipes to the next level, here. I am reminded of recipes from Dynamo Donuts in SF, Sidecar in the OC, and the now defunt Glazed Donut Bistro in Weho. \n\nI had a Vegan berry thyme donut and it was amazing. The filling was complex, the raised donut was simple, and it all worked together really well. We also tried the apple bacon fritter which functioned as a deliciously dense and filling breakfast pastry."
1,"I ordered the turkey bacon ranch, the #4 but I prefer it without the bacon.  This sandwich was heaven and the mix of ranch turkey and cheddar was just perfect....I took off the bacon but added jalepenio.  This place is hidden near the ACE hardware behind the Paradise Bakery and other business's in this strip mall.  Super clean and casual inside, they have a cool self serve soda machine that has been popping up in upscale fast food places.  You order at the counter and they are very friendly here.  They bring your food to your table and thats it, simple, good, and filling."
0,We thought we would give this place a try since we bought the Groupon.  After hearing how the owner was a Michelin-Star recipient.  But he did not live up that at all.  The food was over priced and the burger was very dry.  We will never go back!!!
0,"What can I say about Arlequino's? I'm a Montreal ex-pat living in Ottawa, but I always return home for my birthday to celebrate with friends from Montreal. From a distance, and through some searching I came upon this lovely sounding restaurant and booked it for my group of 16. Unfortunately this turned out to be a mistake of epic proportions. Let's follow the night in order of events.\n\nDrink orders:\nOne of my friends suggested we split a bottle of wine, a suggestion I liked, but neither of us are really wine connoisseurs. We asked the waitress for some suggestions, letting her know that we both preferred sweeter white wines, but she didn't know anything about the wine menu, \""I don't really drink wine\"" was her response. We asked her if anyone there knew, and she just shrugged. Not particularly helpful.\n\nAppetizers:\nOn reading some reviews a friend and I decided to try the calamari, they serve it here in long strips and it was fried up nicely, but there was very little flavouring to it without any dipping sauce. The sauce they served it with seemed to be some sort of mayo-based sauce but I didn't really know what it was, and it didn't taste very good. Another of my friends ordered the fried bocconcini, it sounded nice but for $7 it came with 2 pieces, which is a little disappointing. The ceasar salad I ordered was tasty if a bit too salty.\n\nPizza:\nWhile I won't comment second hand on everyone else's pizza experience, I will talk about the one I tried. I ordered the Pescara, which sounded very nice as: tomato sauce, cheese, pancetta and hot peppers. First this is not the wood burning pizza you would expect. As reviewer Dave I. suggests this is not authentic wood burning pizza. The top had burnt crusts yet the cheese was completely evenly cooked and well spaced out and the bottom was soggy, and not crispy at all. The worst of it was the over-abundant use of hot peppers on this particular variation; the rest of the ingredients couldn't be tasted with the amount of hot peppers they used, it was just completely unbalanced. I would have tasted the same flavours had I just eaten some soggy dough and a jar of hot peppers.\n\nDessert:\nHere's where my biggest issue of the night started. When I called to book they had asked if I wanted a birthday cake. I thought \""why not?\"" and chose a cake. Now it's certainly my fault at this point for not asking the cost of this added service, but for they price they charged they could have mentioned it. This restaurant claimed to have made the cake in house and charged $5 per person for the cake (a total of $75). Now I know this is how some higher end restaurants work, and while I wouldn't call Arlequino's higher end, it's their right to choose this business model. My issue of contention is not the actual cost of the cake but the reaction of the owner of the restaurant when I spoke to him about this issue. I calmly and politely told him that if they were going to charge such an exorbitant amount for a tiny cake, the least they could do is tell people the cost up front without having to be asked. Had I known, I would have brought my own cake. His response was: \""We'd have charged you $3 per person if you brought your own. What can I tell you? It's business.\"" For me this was an inadequate response to a customer concern. I'm not saying I expected him to reimburse me for the cake; I didn't expect any sort of gratuity, but the man didn't even have the decency to apologize or attempt to appease me in any sort of way. This is no way to manage any sort of service industry business, let alone a restaurant. His response was equally cold and careless to one of my friends who tried to speak to him about the same issue. \n\nThat final experience of the night led me to understand Arlequino's for what it is. This is an upscale, supposedly hip pizzeria. The decor and ambience are fantastic, but their downfall is that they are far more invested in the look than the quality of food or their customers' satisfaction. I certainly imagine that the owner will begin to care more about his customers when they stop coming to eat at this restaurant."
1,a good buffet
0,"I was looking forward to this place for my birthday for awhile. I wanted to like it. It started badly. We were stuck in traffic and were half and hour late. I called them several times and they never answered but left a message. (Just reserving for this place is not easy. They never answer and they call you back to let you know if they have place a few days later) anyway, when we got to the restaurant they had given up our spot. After telling them it was birthday they managed to squeeze us in a spot after waiting another half an hour. The ambiance had a sugar shack feel. Including sitting very close to others. There is not much room in between tables. My husband had the foie gras poutine and I had the duck carpaccio. They were both great but he said his was very rich. I loved my plate as it was light. I also tried the bite sized foie which was wonderful. I then ordered a stew with porc and potatoe gratin on top. He has the \""meat plate\"" to be honest both were too heavy. The food is prepared well but leaving here you almost fall into a food coma right away. In my opinion overhyped and pricey. I will not be going back."
1,Dropped my iPhone 5c last night and broke the glass :( but took my phone here to get it repaired and it only took 30mins!! Awesome place and great prices !
0,"This was show was so confusing and boring that my bf and i left during their intermission! oh they, had technical problems too, so it was definitely a sign to leave!!!"
1,"This place is insane. I once ate here weekly for a month. I couldn't help it. Everything I've ever had here has been amazing. The ice cream bars, the banana tempura fondue, the banana split latte, the BALT. Everything. It's all amazing. While the service is sometimes a bit off, it never matters. As long as the chocolate is there I don't care. The restaurant even LOOKS like chocolate. There are pipes all around leading to the bar which has large tubs of milk, white, and dark chocolate. I've wondered if anyone has ever stupidly tried to break those pipes open. \n\nP.S. If you're going to come to Max Brenner, you MUST get something with chocolate in it. It makes me sad when I see people come in and order just a salad and a water. It makes me want to force feed them chocolate. Come here to indulge!"
1,"If you have been to a Round Table before, then you can expect the same great pizza. The staff is super friendly. The only negative thing about this location is the inside. This place definitely needs a makeover BAD! If you can get past the run down feel of the furniture then you will enjoy your meal. \n\nI hope they redo the inside soon, they will definitely get more business."
0,"This place is ok, the two people they had working on the food order side preparing the food were not the best they have ever had.  Everything we had on this visit was over cooked and not very tasty, a huge disappointment this time.\n\nWe probably will go back, but they have to get the people they normally have back there preparing the food otherwise this will not be a place we frequent for a meal.  Normally we don't leave without ordering other items to go as for a bakery they do have some pretty good items, however, most if not all have cinnamon in their items which is a bad point for me."
1,"Once upon a time, diners were a staple of the American lifestyle.\n\nHard-nosed waitresses who didn't take anyone's crap would serve you piping hot coffee.  Experts who didn't really look like experts would sling the best tasting food, their processes visible to those sitting in the front of the dining room.  The regulars and the staff knew each other well enough to hold a conversation and trade jokes and barbs with a great sense of humor.\n\nThe diner was once a palace of comfort.  The food, the people, the atmosphere... everything felt like home when you came in for a simple cup of joe.\n\nIt's nice to find a haven like this in the modern landscape of franchise wars.\n\nKeep your Denny's.  Forget about Bob Evans.  You can even tell Eat n' Park to have Smiley take a powder.\n\nUnbeknownst to some, there is a real-deal diner of legend still standing in Pittsburgh, and it only really came into being in 2007.\n\nHot Metal Diner, a rapidly growing establishment of the South Hills area, is a Mecca for the person who misses the days of the tried and true diner. The waitresses have attitude, the coffee is always fresh and hot, and the food is always incredible. \n\nThis reviewer was disappointed to discover this place so far after its original opening.  If I had known the environment, I would have been eating there since their inception. As it stands, I'm there a minimum of once a week, not disappointed in the least if I spend two lunches straight going there.\n\nEverything about this place screams attitude.  From the rules posted at the front door (which you'll want to abide by if you value your life) to the fire-engine red, limited edition, Harley-Davidson on display in their newly completed party room.\n\nAs far as the food is concerned, the menu offers a bevy of breakfasts and lunches, each more incredibly tasty than the last.\n\nMost things on this menu are not for the small of stomach.  You certainly get what you pay for with things like the Mancakes (two pancakes roughly the size of truck rims which hang over the edges of the plate), the breakfast burrito (over a foot long and stuffed three inches high), or even the club sandwich (served on thickly sliced bread so as to make one's mouth unhinge to take a bite).\n\nOne of the main reasons for the tastiness of the food, particularly to the Pittsburgher's palate, is the exclusive use of some local ingredients.  Hot Metal Diner serves only Uncle Charley's sausage and Mancini's bread products.  These are all put to good use in the hands of their more than capable kitchen who use extra thick slices of bread to craft the French toast and smashing the sausage patties flat enough to fit with some eggs and cheese on the Fatboy breakfast sandwich.  (incidentally, Hot Metal is one of the only places in Pittsburgh who will serve you hot sausage with your breakfast, if you should so choose!)\n\nEven if you are a Hot Metal virgin, the waitstaff is known to pull up a chair to your table while taking your order, usually engaging you in some friendly, if not incredibly sarcastic and cynical, conversation.  This place has personality, unlike the sterile chain restaurant environments which have become the standard.\n\nThe personality of Hot Metal Diner is as much a factor as is the food.  From the first time I went in, I felt like I knew the entire staff. They are as comfortable around their customers as they are their family.  It's this warm (if not sometimes chidingly hostile) environment that makes this place a true reincarnation of diners passed.\n\nThe food, the people, the place... everything is incredible at Hot Metal Diner.  Going here once just isn't enough and soon you'll find yourself bringing friends along to indulge in the diner's incredible food and entertaining people.\n\nI highly recommend Hot Metal to anyone looking for a good breakfast, a good cup of coffee, and a whole lot of attitude."

1,"Decided to come here for lunch after work. My man picked me up and we were in the mood for a sandwich. I was so glad we found a JJ's nearby! The store was clean and employees very helpful and friendly.\n\nI ordered a \""Beach Club\"". It had Fresh baked turkey breast, provolone cheese, avocado spread, sliced cucumber, lettuce, tomato, and mayo. I asked them to leave the sprouts off and they said they didn't offer them anymore so I don't know if that is just this location no longer offering them or all of them. This sandwich was delicious! I could eat one everyday! The cost for this sandwich was $5.75\n\nMy man had the \""Italian Night Club\"". He actually ordered 2 of these because he has a big appetite and the sandwiches are just 8 inches so not quite the footling you would get at Subway. This sandwich had genoa salami, Italian capicola, smoked ham, and provolone cheese, lettuce, tomato, onion, mayo, and Italian vinaigrette. This sandwich also cost $5.75\n\nJJ's delivers an caters. You can place orders online.\n\nI love JJ's! The prices are very affordable for what you get. This will make a great lunch stop while working on this side of town. I'm a fan and will be back!"
1,Root beer float is my favorite cocktail. Service is always great! We'll be back again!
1,Houlihan's has turned around quite a bit.  I like the appetizers and the (over priced) drinks.
0,"Decided to give it a try based on Yelp reviews. We will not be going back. Red and green burrito's are very bland. No flavor at all. As a matter of fact has a lot of flour added. Rice was mushy. Beans, tamale, taco, chips and salsa were ok. They only have a carne asada plate. No carne asada for tacos or burritos. Never heard of that before. Wow! That is just strange. They are very clean. That's was the only good thing."
1,"When we first moved here, we stayed at the M resort and took advantage of their spa.  The staff is great- incredibly friendly and the spa itself is wonderfully relaxing. \n\nBut the 5 stars is really based on Anthony in the salon.  \n\nHe is not only a superb stylist, he totally understands what we want and explains what he's doing and why.\nPlus, he blew us away by remembering who we were, with details, the second time we came in.  Anthony has long term clients in us- and I highly recommend him to anyone looking for an excellent stylist."
1,"i liked it, but we have Viet restaurants here in S. FL too and it tastes like the good ones so yeah! \""Yay! I'm a fan.\"" lol"
1,"Came here for a late lunch, early dinner.  They are closed on Monday, which I dicovered last Monday.  Not too much parking space on  a busy day, but this day it was fine.\n The food is a bit different. Yes, it is Mexican Food ,but New Mexico , Mexican Food.  They are more famous i think, for the drinks they serve. Though i like the food it is good, I like the more traditional Mexican food. It is just a bit too hot for me.\nHey the older you get the harder it is to go spicey.  Service is good, and lots of people love it!"
1,"This is the burgh's mini Rockefeller Center!  I get so excited when I see the rink going up every year around October.  It's one of the best things to do around the holidays regardless of if you have kids, going with friends or date.  Remember that it will be the most crowded Friday-Sunday and also you'll be paying around $10 including skates.  But it's worth it at least once a year!"
1,"So I have to have real Mexican food when I come to Arizona and had to try this joint. I always ask if a Mexican place has cotija cheese and if they answer in the affimative, then I know they at least have the potential of being authentic. So I get the torta ahogada, pork. Super tasty pork with avocado, cotija cheese (I asked them for it) with a spicy red sauce covering it and drizzled with cream. All of my friends loved it as it was delicious. Also, the counter guy taking our order was so helpful and friendly and BAM got our order spot on. He could tell we had never been there before and kept offering us samples of the ice cream, horchata (SO GOOD) and soup.\nI wish I had tried their paletas, they looked delicious but we were all happy with what we got. I wish I lived here so I could eat there again. Yum."
1,An outstanding new addition to the Southern Highlands Bar scene. Staff is friendly and courteous and the food is great. \n\nThe place is also configured well and you don't feel crammed or worried about having a place to sit.\n\nPool tables are nice and parking was easy.\n\nWe found our new place to hang out.
0,"Okay, I SO don't get people's obsession with Grimaldi's.  This is the second time I've tried is (I thought the first time I didn't like it was because I just ordered the wrong thing), but this latest trip confirmed my dislike. And I know what it is. The cheese. Oh no, not the cheese!!!! Yes, the cheese. It tastes fake. Seriously. And when it melts it makes the pizza look like plastic. In fact, it kind of tastes like plastic, too. I liked the thin crust and the sauce, but the cheese is awful. The house salad was lacking in color and freshness, too. \n\nOh, and our server? I hope she was having a bad day because she had the snootiest attitude I think I've ever encountered."
0,"I went into this Midas yesterday for an oil change and had a VERY bad experience - I came home and wrote to customer service and I guess it goes right to the store...not sure what good that does: here is my letter and the VERY unprofessional response I got from Dennis Robbins:\n\nMy letter to customer service: \""I came in today for an oil change and to have an oil leak checked. I have been in before and dealt with Guy Walker who was always very helpful and nice. I came into today and got a very rude reception - not by Guy - he wasn't there - I told the gentleman I needed an oil change and the reply was \""hey I can't just pull a guy off of a job just to change your oil!\""....what....first of all it says NO WHERE on the coupon that I need an appt (never had one before)and this guy told me he was basically busy for the next few days.....and 2nd of all DON'T OFFER A DEAL THEN!!!!! I was willing to wait to see if he had a no-show but after his bad attitude I told him I would take my biz elsewhere. I have lived in AZ for 2 years and have YET to find a friendly, reliable mechanic to work on my car.....I will now give ALL of my biz to Marshall's Service Center in Scottsdale - even though their prices are higher they are kind, courteous, professional and do a GOOD job without complaining or being rude to customers! There is NOTHING more that infuriates me than BAD customer service...as you can tell!\""\n\nMr Robbins VERY unprofessional response: \n\""Maam IF you had read your coupon, it states that an appointment is recommended but not required. i guess you failed to see that.But i have a great customer base that understands total maintinance, not just oil changes. If You had read and called to make sure that a bay was open, i would have fit you into the schedule. I guess ill just go into my doctor next time instead of making an appointment. Good Day\""\n\nHe was RUDE, UNPROFESSIONAL AND CONDESCENDING to the WRONG WOMAN! I will NEVER go to ANY Midas location again - I have put a call into the corporate office to see if this is how they train their franchisee's to treat their customers! DO NOT GO TO THIS MIDAS!"
1,"The acts were great...the type of stuff that you would find making it onto the further rounds of America's Got Talent altogether in one show...with a good variety...good character cast and some stuff I've never seen before. \n\nPaid $23 (tip included) for a mojito in a thin glass. It was a good mojito and if I wasn't a local but just here on vacation I wouldn't mind, but being a local, I think of all the food that could buy. =p\n\nOverall the entertainment exceeded my expectations, I wasn't sure what to expect."
0,"This was our first and last visit for dinner using a $10 Restaurant.com coupon.  It was hidden in a small strip mall on W Sahara Ave/near S Rainbow Blvd in Las Vegas.  When we walked in, the owner gestured for us to sit down.  There was only a party of three there with a coupon. A woman walked in with a Groupon and the owner said they are no longer accepting Groupons so she walked out.  \n\nThey do not have a website but they do have a Facebook page.  They had Chinese, Thai, and Vietnamese items on the menu.  The Vietnamese food was reasonably priced.  The curry, duck, seafood, and some of the specialty entrees were expensive.\n\nThe tables had burgundy table cloths covered with glass.  A single Cala Lily was in a vase at each table.  Rap music was playing.\n\nThe owner took our order, left the menu in our hands and then brought us glasses of water 10 minutes after we walked in.  My friend ordered the Shrimp and Pork Noodle Bowl and I ordered the Shrimp Rice Plate.  We also ordered the Summer Rolls.\n\nThe two Summer Rolls came out on a plate with peanut sauce.  They were not cut in half.  I like my Summer Rolls to be cut in half.  There was no mint or shredded carrot garnish like on the Facebook page.\n\nAbout 25 minutes after we arrived, the owner told me that thay were out of white steamed rice.  He asked me if I wanted brown rice or noodles.  I said noodles were okay.  Why didn't he tell me that when I ordered #34?  What Asian restaurant runs out of white rice during prime dinner time?\n\nThe owner was also the cook.  I could see him frying something.  A young Asian guy walked in and started clearing plates from the other party's table.  He must have been out on a delivery.\n\nThe Shrimp and Pork Noodle Bowl had 3 boiled or barely grilled shrimp on a skewer with yellow squash and sliced carrot.  There was about 2 tablespoons of BBQ pork. There was shredded carrot and peanut garnish.\n\nThe Shrimp Rice Plate was now a noodle bowl with 2 skewers of 5 shrimp and vegetables with a garnish of shredded carrot and chopped peanuts.  It was served with fish sauce.  I had to ask for a spicy tray to give the entree some flavor.\n\nWe did not get a refill of water nor did the owner check on us.  We will not be back."
0,"This has got to be the WORST McDonald's ever.  I have lived less than a mile from it for 4 years.  I am not big on McDonald's, but my kids are.  I have learned to drive miles out of my way to go to another McDonald's.\n\nInevitably, though, out of laziness or maybe hope, I keep trying this McDonald's only to have the order screwed up or something to be wrong with the food (stale french fry grease anyone?)  or both.  \n\nNothing like the look of disappointment on a child's face when their french frys taste of stale grease.  \n\nI am not sure if this is a franchise store or corporate owned, but it has consistently been TERRIBLE for FOUR YEARS.\n\nThis McDonald's just needs to be NUKED from orbit."
0,"We went there twice. The first time it was short staffed, friendly but bad service. The second time lots of service. We had at least 4 different people waiting on our table. Unfortunately the food is mediocre. Their signature dish \""firecracker shrimp\"" tastes like nothing with some hot sauce and the consistency of a wad of cardboard tough shrimp. No shrimp flavor. The calamari was cut into squares it was overcooked, rubbery and fishy smelling. The pho was hardly flavored. On the plus side they had Kirin on tap. The staff hypes the firecracker shrimp but is not good."
0,"Dropped in for a quick dinner.  The seating by the staff was rude and just herding cattle.  We sat down. .... had our silver ware when someone walked by and slammed two more sets down without saying a word.  Then we asked for bread , oh my the way NO BUTTER unless you request it.  . The .steak ordered appeared to have been grilled and then microwaved on a plate.  The waiter then asks how every thing is.  Wrong question.  He became confrontational AND offered to have the chef speak to us.  Then the manager is brought into the fray. His response. .... go to the corporate website and tell them.  These was the worst meal out in a long long long time.  Do yourself s favor pay attention to yelp. ... do not spend your money or time in this place. ...disgusting"
1,"this buffet definitely has a lot of variety.  i thought it would never end haha.  best part is unlimited drinks!  wine/beer included.\n\nit's about 30 minutes from the strip, and $36 plus change for the meal.  guess they just started this last saturday, but...\n\nTIP: if you go on SATURDAY get a player's card (free) and get a buy one get one free meal!"
0,"There's one thing that sums up this restaurant... On the menu, there is an item called \""Free Range Veal\"".  Huh?  Everyone at our table questioned that. Sounded more like marketing hype.  So of course, the waiter made up some incomprehensible, illogical B.S.  explanation.  It went downward from there.  It was one of the more forgettable dining experiences I've had on the Strip."
1,"I have found my new waxing spot! After being a customer at the Birthday Suit for over a year and had a horrible experience with such rude staff I was at a lost. I read through yelp and decided to give a chance. I believe her name was Karla cute blonde from San Diego, is the bomb! Made me feel so comfortable, staff was awesome and totally relaxed watching a movie as I got waxed. Oh and totally loved the bling skull and crossbones glitter tattoo! Huge hit! I will be recommending this place to all my girlfriends! Totally love it!"
1,"G&V is the rebranded Missoni Hotel. From what I can see nothing but the name has changed. The staff are still in their kilts and it is still as fluorescent as it ever was. \nNice to have table service, complimentary popcorn at your table and they also have prosecco on tap. \nNice for a catchup with the girls."
0,"If you are looking for good Asian food cuisine this is not the place to go to. The food is over priced & of poor quality. I went to Mama Fu's after work one evening for dinner and was very disappointed. When I entered the restaurant I was not greeted and to be frankly honest didn't know whether I needed to sit down at a table to have someone take my order or if I needed to go to the front counter to place my order. When I finally did figure out that I needed to go to the counter to place my order I sat down and waited for my food to arrive. The food arrived in less than five minutes and the server brought my food without bringing out eating utensils! When I asked the server for a fork she said \"" Oh you do need a fork? \"" Last time I checked civilized people do not eat a rice dish with their hands. When she did bring the fork and I was finally able to eat my food I realized that the food was luke warm and just plain tasteless ( I ordered the Red Thai Curry Dish) That particular dish was supposed to be spicy and had no taste what so ever. I left the restaurant sorely disappointed and $10.00 dollars poorer!"
1,"First of all, screw the entrees, the fries are TO DIE FOR. For crispy fries, can't think of a better place on State Street.\n\nBest enjoyed while hammered... the Greek music videos are an interesting touch.\n\nI heard stories about how, years ago, in place of Pizza di Roma, another gyros shop competed with Parthenon, and they used to sharpen their knives in the windows, either threatening each other or trying to draw more customers. Sadly not the case anymore, would be much more entertaining if so.\n\nFor a student, within reason but a *bit* pricy, especially if one already spent money out."
1,I'm not sure how many times I've been to Vegas but this is my first time visiting the sign.  I was surprised to see there was a little small parking lot to stop at so you don't have to worry about where to park. The people in line were really cool and patient.  I think people took like 3 pictures and no one rushed anyone.  It was a beautiful day and made for some nice photos.  Good times!
1,"We snacked at the bar and had a few drinks for happy hour. It was amazing and a great deal. I recommend the stuffed dates and the steak frites. The bartender was helpful and friendly. I would have never known about this gem if it were not for a random happy hour search, and now I definitely plan on returning and trying their full menu."
1,"This is one of those locations that I have walked past the last two years and never got around to trying.  My main attraction to the storefront is the plastic food out front, which just looks so wonderfully Japanese to me.  There is something about shiny plastic food replicas that really peaks my interest.  Also, the amount of corn used on the food also made me think that it was a Japanese franchise.  It is in fact not, but Canadian, and Montreal specific.  The only other two location are at the Six Flags Theme Parks in the province.  \n\nThis is a small cafe with only one worker that does everything, or at least at the times that I visited.  You order at the counter and pay, and then they will call out your order for pick-up.  Seating is limited to about three tables, with an excellent view of the street.  \n\nThey are sold out of many items, like chicken salad and waffles.  However, I ordered the Tuna Salad Crepe and it tasted much better than expected.  The crepe was slightly sweet and crunchy, filled with tuna salad sandwich toppings; tomato, lettuce, corn, sliced processed cheese, and tuna salad.  All of the items here are cheap, keeping most under $5.50 CAD.  \n\nAlso, we ordered a Nutella covered plain crepe, it was perfect.  These are not knife and fork style crepes, instead the hand held version.  Most of the toppings are made in house.  I watched the cook slicing the fresh strawberries before assembling them for the previous customer.  Next time, I will get that chicken salad with curry topping."
0,"The Mirage on the strip gets stars for its pretty perfect location. On the surface, this place is decent, but I pay attention to many details. The rooms were certainly more spacious than the Wynn, but also not a updated and swanky. The bathrooms could use a little facelift (the shower curtain, shower heads, doors and paint) and most importantly, the mattresses need to be replaced! Lopsided mattress is a deal breaker, but given that we drank too much to notice on our trip, it didn't matter so much. \n\nThe one-star rating is due to the fact that I left a valuable bracelet behind and realized it pretty quickly, so I made all the necessary phone calls only to not have my calls returned or be transferred between different departments. No one ever wrote my information down, so every time I called, I had to start all over. I called way before anyone else could have possibly checked into the room, knowing exactly where to direct the security personnel. I gave a clear description. I was extremely thorough. By the time I was finally able to speak to someone that cared, another guest had checked in. Granted, it was my mistake to have left it behind, it was very clear that everyone I spoke to could care less. I requested to place a claim against the hotel after two whole days of going back and forth with them and nothing. It's super disappointing that hotels with this much security can provide such poor customer service. Ultimately, this leaves me questioning their integrity."
1,"The Mill and Baseline location is excellent. Service is fast and friendly, prices are reasonable and portions generous.  Their veggie burro is excellent with big fresh chunks of avacodo, mm hmm. Their chips and salsa are also better than most casual taco shops. You can order ahead and pick up at the take out windows."
1,"The service was fast and friendly.  I ordered the Big Dip (single dip) with curly fries and a drink. My wife ordered the FOB with curly fries and a drink. My sandwich was very good, and with only the single dip was not too messy. The roast beef had a good flavor and the au jus was hot and full of flavor as well. It was served with a side of spicy mustard; it was good too, but a little overpowering. The FOB my wife had was incredible. The roast beef was cooked perfect and had a ton of flavor, the sauce was delicious too. The only disappointment was the curly fries, not much flavor there.  I will definitely be heading back."
0,I was not impressed with this clinic. \nPros:\n1. The vet did tell us where to find pet meds for a cheaper price\n\nCons: \n1.Their website was not up to date as far as their location and address. \n2. The staff was not very friendly. \n3. I felt very rushed to get in and out \n4. Received a card in the mail and thought it might be a welcome note but it was a request for referrals!
0,"Super slow, there were only few tables of customer, but it took almost an hour to have all our food out! Miso soup very salty, eel thin like paper. That was all you can eat, we ordered 5 orders of uni sushi, few minutes later, a guy told us that they only have 2 orders left, after a while, he came back again and said the uni is not fresh, so they cannot give us any...what the...I don't recommend this restaurant to anyone."
1,"I read some of the reviews on here and were a bit worried, but I figured what the hell why not give them a shot myself. They kept putting flyers on our door, so we ordered actually just last night. My husband got the meatball sub and I got the antipasto salad, the sauce they used was very good, the meatballs were delicious! The bread was perfect! My salad was huge! with lots of the fixings that come with an antipasto. even the dressing was good, none of that kraft garbage. I would recommend to give them a shot."
1,"It's a beautiful show but not entirely worth the $185 I paid to sit in one of the first rows. It is impressive but at about half the price, Mystere is a more focused, immersive experience with more awe-inducing acrobatics. At times I felt there was too much going on and lost focus and it made me somewhat check out of the show, whereas Mystere really locks you in and keeps the viewer engaged."
0,"I grew up in Birmingham, AL and this was literally the worst BBQ restaurant I have been to in my life (39 years). If you didn't grow up with BBQ, please don't think that what they serve at Pot Liquor is BBQ. Even Famous Dave's is better than this garbage.\n\nThe pulled pork was cooked at too high a temperature for too short a time, so the outside was hard and inedible and the fat and connective tissue didn't break down like it is supposed to, making the interior meat also mostly inedible.\n\nThey serve what they call \""Alabama Sweet Tea\"". To me, it tasted like unsweetened tea. In the south, sweet tea is extremely sweet. I understand toning it down a little bit for those not used to it, but this was extremely bland. I complained and they brought me another glass from a different batch, but it was the same.\n\nTheir sauces have the non-descriptive names of Cue #1 thru Cue #4. I had to ask what they were. I tried all of them and they were terrible. I think #4 was their \""Alabama White Sauce\"". Instead of being a tangy thin white sauce that can penetrate down into the meat, it was basically 98% mayonnaise with a little bit of seasoning. Disgusting.\n\nThey couldn't get basics right, and most of the rest of the menu consists of inappropriate fancy modifications of southern food.\nExamples include:\n\""Fried Catfish Benedict\"": Fried catfish should be able to stand on its own. hollandaise sauce is completely inappropriate.\n\""Devil'd Eggs\"": topped with deep fried chicken skin. The flavor of the skin completely overpowered the egg.\n\""Brownie Bread Pudding\"": bread pudding is already very sweet if made correctly and chocolate is not an appropriate flavor combination. Then they serve it with \""sea salt vanilla gelato\"". If you asked for \""sea salt vanilla gelato\"" in a real BBQ place in the south, they would laugh at you and probably throw you out.\n\""Fried Pies\"": this sounds pretty basic but the description says it is served with \""malted anglaise\"". What the heck?\n\""Strawberry Shortcake Sandwiches\"": sounds pretty straight forward but it comes with strawberry cream gelato. Again with the gelato!\n\""Kansas City Style Burnt Ends\"": Another staple. But they shake \""sugar in the raw\"" over the top. The burnt ends were good but the sugar made the experience unpleasant. Really? You can put sugar on meat that shouldn't have it but you can't put it in your sweet tea?\n\nI told them their chef needs to visit Alabama and learn how to make real southern food. They assured me that he HAD visited Alabama and spent a whole 10 days there. You can't learn BBQ in 10 days. Good BBQ chefs have spent well over 10 years learning to make it. Pot Liquor does not serve southern BBQ or any southern dishes. I may try them again in a couple years if they haven't gone out of business. Perhaps by then they will have found a cook book and learned to make some actual southern food."
1,"Great place to visit , has loads of shops as well as cinemas . Nice bars where you can sit and watch the world go by and it also has the royal yacht brittania moored there. Free parking and good safe place for families."
0,THE WORST CLUB EVER IN VEGAS!!! the crowd was filled with middle aged people and the music they played i couldn't dance to or get into smh. The drinks and watching the crowd that couldn't dance made the experience more enjoyable.
0,I couldn't believe it -- I had breakfast at this location not long ago and it was great ( as far as fast food is concerned) however last Friday after helping our Son move all day long we went to this Wendy's for a late dinner -- Like 8:30P -- We had a couple burgers and fries. A couple of the new Ciabatta Bacon Cheeseburgers== The bread on the Ciabatta was so stale the top of the bun cracked when touched-- The meat patties on the burgers were luke warm and basically tasteless-- I found out why-- the kids working the place had pre-cooked a whole stack of patties on the grill and were using those to make the sandwiches-- BLAH-- One f the push button soda machines was putting our nothing but carbonated water-- We told them== they replied that they knew it and instructed us to use the other machine--( no sign -- no apology)-\nWe don't know if it was the young group running the place or was I close to closing ?? What we do know is it will be a long time before we return-- Shameful
0,"I went to Shula's for a small dinner party for a friend's 40th birthday on 09.04.12..  As we arrived, I noticed a sign \""still undefeated.\""  Well, Shula's lost that evening because the service was dreadful, now they're 14 - 1.  \n\nThe waitress was nice and knew the birthday boy and his girlfriend from past dinners.  Honestly, I believe the poor service was not her fault.  Instead, it was the back-end staff's inability to deliver our orders in a timely manner and their inability to deliver what we ordered.  We placed two orders of the crab mac-n-cheese and we had to ask an additional two times for the food.  \n\nThe food was still very good, but for close to a million dollars a plate, I was expecting better service.  I will keep giving my business to Durants.  \n\nGo Raiders!"
1,Best musubi in town! Everything I've eaten here has been so delicious! Huge portions absolute comfort food. My new favorite Hawaiian restaurant! I'd recommend the roasted pork smothered in gravy or the loco moco breaded chicken on a bead of rice smothered with gravy and topped with an egg. Sooo good!
1,"Cheese plate.  If you don't order the cheese plate here, you are doing something wrong.  No...I'm not typically one to order a cheese plate, unless all I am planning on for my meal is wine and cheese, but here I must have a cheese plate for the table.  Not only do they select great cheeses for the table dependent upon what your cheese tastes are, but when they arrive they are accompanied by black truffle honey, brandied cherries, and apricots in a thick syrup - which are all absolutely divine when accompanying the cheese.  It actually takes me about 45 minutes to eat a piece of cheese here because I am savoring all the flavors excessively and consuming tiny pieces to make the glory last as long as possible.  \nMoving on from the cheese, I must say I am a big fan of the Penne ala Norma.  In fact, after having this treat I went out and bought Batali's cookbook just so we could prepare the pasta at home.  Mine is never as good as his, but it will do since I don't get to Vegas as often as I would like.  \nI got so busy salivating over memories of the food that I forgot to mention that the location is stunning too.  On my first trip here I was recently back from a trip to Venice and was really amused and blown away by the attempt to recapture the winding streets and open squares of Venice inside the Venetian Canal shops.  While the results are not quite authentic, there is something wonderful about seemingly sitting out on in the \""open-air\"" on the Piazza San Marco while dining at this Enoteca.  Great people watching, dusk-like lighting, and eye catching architecture accompany fantastic food at a decent, for Vegas, price."
0,"We are very disappointed with the management, as they refused to let our kids use their restroom. What kind of toy store doesn't let kids use its bathroom? They need to change their bathroom policy before we go back to spend our money there!"
1,"Awesome customer service! Very knowledgeable and friendly employees! Clean, inviting atmosphere with lots of variety in products and juices! I just stumbled on this place while driving by and ran in to get a much needed coil. They didn't carry it anymore so they game me a similar one for free!!!! Even though I live 20 min in the other direction, I plan to always come back to this e-cig store because of this experience!!"
0,So disappoint... We ordered a live lobster but It turned out to be a dead one. Ruining my taste.
0,"A lovely idea for a business and I was looking forward to trying this place when it opened last year. However, when I went along and tried some of the beers on offer, I was totally shocked at the prices being charged. Prices vary from around \u00a36 to nearly \u00a310 for a litre of beer! That is way more expensive than pub prices (as an average), so I fail to see how this business can be a success going forward. Yes, I understand that dealing in small batches of beer and regularly changing the beers on offer, will add cost but if you get yourself to somewhere like Stewart Brewing at Loanhead you get draught beer to take away in bottles, in exactly the same way as Growler Beers of Morningside but Stewart's are around half the price with draft beer ranging from around \u00a33.80 to less than \u00a35. There can be no justification for this kind of extra cost being charged by Growler Beers and I think the owner needs to rethink his strategy, as every time I pass the shop, it is empty. It looks like the high prices are keeping the punters away! Oh and by the way, Stewart Brewing do some excellent beers!"
0,"How is this hotel still in operation? By far the worst hotel still left from the old Vegas era. Perhaps this hotel can be torn down and moved to Reno or better yet New Mexico desert.\n\nThe staff stole my wifes bikini bottoms!!! Oh and someone left a terd in my hotel room toliet with the toliet brush still in it!!! .... As if it was me...ya, like I would carry a toliet bowl brush with me in my suitcase, would use the bathroom and then not flush?! WTF...seriously. \n\nI left the sign out not to disturb/no houskeeping and that exactly the opposite of what happened. I awoke to some maid riffeling through my open suitcase. She said it was in her way of cleaning and that she was moving it out of the way. After speaking to the front desk, they said they would get us free VIP passes to their stanky run down club. Has anyone seen this 'nightclub'? OMG what a joke.\n\nRun! Far away and dont look back. Did I mention I saw pest control in hazmat suits going into an apartment 3 doors down? Yikes. Scary"
1,"Curry soup (small):\nAmazing! Broth was savory, with a hint of coconut milk and other spices. There was chicken, carrots, green beans, radish, and potatoes, and bamboo shoots. I personally didn't particularly care much for the previously mentioned items--the broth and potatoes made this dish for me. Came with rice. \n\nBBQ combo platter (large):\nCame with:\n- 3 beef skewers: Delicious, best item of the platter. Tender meat with intense flavor and spices.\n- 3 huge chicken wings: These were okay. The skin tasted great, but because the wings were so big(?) the flavor didn't really last past the skin. \n- sliced meat (beef?): Tender, but not strongly flavored. Went well with the sauce. \n- small dish of pickled veggies (carrot & radish): I don't like pickled veggies in general, but I guess this tasted okay. \n- small dish of sauce: It looked similar to fish sauce, but it tastes a bit spicy and salty, not sweet. This went well with the sliced meat. \n\nBasil seed drink:\nI wanted to try this since it looked interesting. The actual flavor tastes like bananas. The texture was interesting, and I wasn't sure whether to chew the seeds or just swallow them whole. It reminded me a bit of the aloe vera drink. Nice and refreshing. \n\nOverall:\nThe curry was my favorite dish. The bbq platter was ok, but I would have rather ordered a full order of the skewers instead. Basil seed drink was ok. \n\nService was average. We didn't wait too long for our food; there were a few other tables, and we came in around 8pm and left shortly after 9. \n\nThe decor and ambiance of the place was great!"
0,"I will never order from Papa John's again!! The worst customer service I have ever experienced. I have called and spoke to the manager about my complaint and he has blown me off every time. I ordered 20 pizzas for an event at my work, on the company credit card and these people cant even provide me with a receipt! I have been asking for one for 4 weeks now, and still nothing... I finally had to declare the receipt lost (as per company policy) but damn Papa John's... GET IT TOGETHER!!"
0,"This place went from being my favorite Pho place to my least. The last 2 times I've ordered from here my food has been gross. First, dirty vegetables. Second, cold broth. It seems like the kitchen staff just doesn't care anymore!"
0,"Ok, so I'm hoping to come back and hopefully food will be better. I know they just opened but it seems unorganized and unprepared.\n\nWhen you first walk in, the joint really makes you feel like you're in a restaurant in the Philippines. We waited a little bit but then the waitress came over and seated us. They quickly took our drink order and said she would be back to take our order.\n\nThe wait time from when you place your order to when you actually receive your food is about 45min or so. Not that this is the waitress' fault or anything. They just opened and are severely understaffed. These girls were trying as hard as possible but with only 2 of them running EVERYTHING, they could only do so much. We were not the only ones who had this issue as some people appeared irritated and were complaining to each other. When the food finally did come out, this is what we thought:\n\nLumpiang Shanghai: They were over fried and lacked filling. I think we would prefer to have less of them for more filling and flavor.  Seasoning was a little bit low as well.\n\nCrispy Chicken Skins: These weren't all too bad. A good unhealthy treat that came out after our entres did. Same with the lumpiang(we ordered them as appetizers).\n\nPancit Bihon: They messed up this order for me and gave me a combination of noodles instead. No big deal but it wouldn't have made a difference. I know pancit is supposed to be oily but no flavor on meat or noodles. I had to add salt and siracha in order to taste something,\n\nCombination Plate: This wasn't horrible actually. We got the chicken adobo lechon kawali served with rice. Tasty but the lechon was kinda tough to eat. Too hard actually.\n\nI wanna say that this bad service was only due to the staff being overwhelmed and that if I come back in a couple months or so, they will have figured things out and gotten their flavors in order. Here's to crossing my fingers!!!"
1,"Yum. Moo Shoo Chicken and House Pork. Both were great. Just what I would have expected after hearing so many great things about House of Mei. \n\nI had read before heading there that it was never busy over the lunch hour, which made it a great place for a business lunch. The service was very friendly. I enjoyed that interaction as much as the food. True to the review we were only one of two parties in there. \n\nI will definitely be back and look forward to trying more items off the menu. The prices were fantastic for the portions. Especially off of the lunch menu."
1,"Soo good, and affordable.. Definitely my favorite restaurant in the city...I get shrimp cocktails and frites, and they each are very affordable for the portions you get."
0,"Visit was in May of 2014:\nAs a BIG fan of music, I was excited to hit this place up. I walked in and my eyes widened at the sight of Sex Pistols memorabilia and I spent a great deal of time walking the entire floor to look at all of the goodies. Unfortunately my excitement was short lived... \n\nMy friend and I sat down at some slot machines. We were carded immediately which is ok. It happens. However, this happened every single 5 minutes. I am not exaggerating. I was carded by the same woman 3 times! I moved to a different area and was again carded by two other guys working the floor. I made a comment to the guy carding me and said wow man every 5 minutes I'm going to be carded, really? And he laughed at me and said I highly doubt that. Had a very poor attitude. Please let me add in that I was here on a weekday and the casino floor was EMPTY. The bars were empty and there were a few scattered people throughout. I wasn't lost in a crowd where they had to continuously card me. There was nobody there! Their poor attitudes and eventual HARASSMENT, drove me out of the place. Yes I use the word harassment because that's exactly what it was! I left very unhappy and I will NEVER return to this place again. What a disappointment."
0,I don't get this salon.  I went there after work on a Tuesday and the salon was dead.   I asked for a pedicure and was told I couldn't get in till Friday?  They need a new business model.
0,"I can't review the food, because we wound up getting up and leaving when they refused our Groupon, telling us they no longer were honoring them, even though they still have one currently for sale on the Groupon site. There was no way we were going to stay and eat there, when they knew we'd paid for the Groupon, and were not upright enough to take it (it is a valid Groupon, not expired). There was one other couple in the whole, unappealing looking place at 6PM on a Friday night. I'd guess they're not doing well, and with this attitude, I can see why. People buy Groupons to try out a place to see if they'll go back, and we were looking for a good Indian restaurant closer to our home than Jewel in the Crown. This will not be it."
0,"From the street, Illegal Jack's looks like a chain restaurant selling unexciting 'tex-mex' food. This is partly true: the food is pretty uninspiring, but surprisingly this place isn't a chain. Inside the restaurant is large, white and empty: it looks unfinished, like the decorators were due to come back and finish it, but didn't because the money ran out. I was enticed there today by the promise of a free burrito, which was duly handed over. I liked that it was made in front of me by a clean and relatively friendly server (kudos to her, she had 1000 of these to make), but I didn't hold out too much hope that I would soon be indulging in a culinary masterpiece. When I got it back to the office, the salsa had made it a bit soggy and it leaked burrito juice all over my desk. It tasted alright, but my judgement was clouded because it was free. I'm not sure I'll be rushing back to pay \u00a35.75 for one."
1,Great brisket sandwiches.  Great beer and whiskey selection.
1,Best veal osso buco I've had outside of Italy!!
0,"It's ok. \n\nI would rather get something else but my boyfriend and his friend have a weird obsession of coming here instead of ordering first. It's not really a big deal till the sun goes down. Then the local college crackheads come out to play. \n\nThe area is pretty sketchy in my opinion and having some cracked out guy talk my ear off while the stoned employees take their time on my pizza is not an ideal Friday night... well it could be for some people. \n\nThe music is kinda loud in the establishment so prepare to have to talk louder then normal to get your order semi right. \n\nI had hungry howies deliverd to my place once. I told the delivery driver to keep the change (was like $5 tip) and he said wow in such a way that I thought he was expecting a bigger tip. \n\nAnyways, I like the howie rolls and the cheese, sausage and green pepper pizza. But when in doubt, if its 2am and your stoned and hungry, just have them deliver it to you instead of waiting with the crackheads at the store."
1,"This place rocks! Great service, awesome food, and comfortable atmosphere. The prices are reasonable."
1,The best!  I haven't been there in years and the last time we went it was a 3.5 hour wait but so worth it!  Great for a date if you want to get to know someone waiting in line so long.  \nMy advice is to arrive at 330pm so that way you can be one of the first in line and eat with the first seating at 5pm.
0,The classic DIVE CASINO that I used to bring all my friends too.\n\nI am going to have to find another classic dive.\n\nI can't wait for it's reopening.
0,"If it was possible to provide negative stars I would.  The entire experience was so awful, the only thing they have going for them is they are better than greyhound, but not by much.  \nThe only thing they are consistent at is being consistently awful. I fly over 100 segments a year and they still manage to surprise me."
0,"I'm going to break it down and perhaps my star rating will make sense to you and to me...b/c I was wavering between a 2 or a 3.  \n\nBackground:\nGroup of 5 (girls night) wanting to check out Bar Marco for drinks and dinner.  We made reservations for a Thursday night, but it wasn't necessary as we were the only ones at a table.  There were a handful of people at the bar, but tables empty.  \n\nDecor:\nIndustrial and incomplete.  I get that they are new, but there's definitely more work to be done...get er done!  Chairs are cold and not that comfortable...it sorta feels like your sitting in a cold (the door brings in frequent drafts) high school cafeteria.  But a whole lot smaller.  \n\nDrinks:\nGimlet - made with tequila.  I was a bit worried b/c I'm not a huge fan of tequila but it was a mild flavoring balanced by the sweet red pepper.  Overall, I was a fan\nbut perhaps it was relative to my next drink (ugh).  As mentioned in other reviews, the gimlet is a bit watery (too much ice?) but after a few sips it was better.  \n \nAperol spritz - cough, cough...medicine that is.  That's what it tasted like to me, not a fan, had a few sips but couldn't finish it. \n\nFood:\nOur waiter told us that they (assuming chefs) would choose for us if we'd like. We were all down for that b/c we felt like they'd know best on what they make really well.  So here goes...\n\nCheese/Meat plate: Now I can't remember everything on it, but I'll try to describe it:\nWalnut Pesto - it was ground up walnuts sweetened with something molded into a circle - tasty!\nQuince paste - it's like a jam, a bit fruity - indifferent.  \nAged Cheddar - I like my cheeses sharp which this was not - average.\nUnidentified soft white cheese - it has a bite to it - good.\nProsciutto - unexpectedly spicy - yum!\nDirty martini salami - looked like a pepperoni with some peppercorns - weird tasting, did not taste like pepperoni (which I like).\n\nSnacks:\nArancini w/ fried egg - decent, but Il Pizziaola makes it best!  It's basically a fried risotto ball.  The fried egg wasn't necessary and didn't add much to the dish.  \nDuck BLT - not a fan, but the rest of the group really liked this.  \nGreens & Beans - yum - this was delish.  It's white beans and kale in some sorta white sauce.  \nPatatas Bravas - yum - this was delish.  Fried potatoes with a smoky tomato chipotle like sauce is how I'd describe it.  Sauce was great.   \n\nEntrees: We shared\nGoat Ragu - I felt like I was eating a dirty sock.  Did I mention I don't like goat meat, so this could have influenced the dirty laundry reference.  The pasta also seemed a bit undercooked.  \nFish - I can't remember the details, but it was a white fish and had raisins, pine nuts, and some other seasonings.  It was really good.  Who would of thought fish and raisins would go together...apparently Bar Marco did.  \n\nChocolate/Drink Flight Pairing\nDark Chocolate - indifferent.  \nChocolate covered Orange rind - tasted like a chocolate covered orange gummie slice.  good.  \nWhite chocolate - tasted like lemon cheese, not good.  \n\nYou're probably thinking, \""Whoa - that's a ton of food and whoa that's a long review\"" - um no, the plates are small and we each could have 1-2 bites of most things.  And, yes, this is a long ass review.  \n\nService\nUmmm...hmmm...this is a tough one and I feel sorta bad that I can't just say \""good\"", b/c it wasn't good but it wasn't bad - it was weird, odd, uncomfortable, distracting, annoying, funny - basically every other adjective other than \""good\"" or \""bad\"".  You have to go there to experience it.  \n\nHighlight reel:\nGimlet, Patatas Bravas, Greens & Beans, maybe the fish entree, my friends (star rating not increased by my awesome friends)."
1,I absolutely LOVE this place! AMAZING bruschetta! Fantastic wine!!!! The atmosphere is great! Indoor an outdoor seating that is comfortable! They even have outdoor heaters to make it even more enjoyable during the cold months! Try the vanilla creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e too... Just Amazeballs! I will be back!!!!!
0,"Went here on a Friday for dinner. We went early due to other reviews about long lines. Lines were fine when we arrived, decent length when we left.\n\nOnly gave 2 stars due to high price buffet and barely average food.  Best part of the meal were the great choices of gelato.  Sushi was decent - nothing interesting. Thought the seafood portion was gross - some of the shrimp I had were slimy and didn't bother to eat."
1,"Love this place.  Good service, good (bar) food, good prices..  They have lots of TV's and plenty of sports on.  Always keep the local stuff on the big screen.  I have been there for many sporting events, but was there last Friday for trivia.  Aside from the CHEATERS that beat us, we all had a great time..\n\nWe'll be back.."
1,"Went here twice this past weekend - once for breakfast and once for dinner. Breakfast waiter was a little slow - I think he had way too many tables so not his fault. He was helpful and I enjoyed the meal. I had the cholesterol free eggs with basil, lowfat cottage cheese, fruit salad, and an espresso shot with brandy (not sure the Italian name but it's the only coffee w/booze) The eggs were great...but I think anything with basil is amazing. The espresso was INCREDIBLE. I mean INCREDIBLE. We live in the era of Starbucks so anytime you can have real espresso pulled by hand, it's such a treat.\n\nDinner was awesome. Only issue was that the minestrone wasn't great :( I got the seafood sampler with calamari, prawn, scallops, grilled polenta, and veggies - a cool $27 but GOOD. Hubby got fettuccine alfredo - nothing spectacular. Dad got the calzone - said it was good and it was very large.\n\nThe best part about the meal was the waiter - wish I could remember his name so I could give him proper recognition. He was witty and friendly without being too familiar, and kept us laughing and entertained throughout the whole meal. You don't generally experience genuinely good service like this anymore, especially in Vegas, so it's quite welcome when it happens :)\n\nOverall, good. If you don't want to spend a lot, you don't have to. If you want to, you can. Lots of options :)"
0,I went to check it out after my workout at LVAC store was extremely hot and uncomfortable inside. Poor customer service did not  seem interested in helping me. Selection poor and price high . Definitely not worth checking out !!!
1,"Tryna have a good time ASAP?! 44 Magnum + 2 extra shots.\nYou'll definitely be on a good level while enjoying Vegas.\n\n*warning if yo dont wanna experience flavored vodka i guess sticking with one extra shot will still give you some level.\n\nEh, felt like customer service was whatever. seemed a bit rude serving but its understandable to those who wanna just have fun ."
1,"this 1 of my favs... eat practically every week... i usually pick up a box ( no fries, extra toast instead ) and bring it home to some fresh made rice, and vegetables on the stove... i'd like this place even more if it had some type of vege... now I'd give 5 stars but the only gripe i have, if it's called a gripe, is last two times i've ordered, came home and opened box, styrofoam is melted in some places where the chicken was touching it.  I'm not sure if im eating styrofoam or not when i eat the chicken.  It doesn't taste any different so i eat it anyway.  I understand that the chicken is so fresh its probably right out of the fryer and put in box but i wish there was some type of foil or something to prevent it from happening..."
0,"Not shave ice but not ice cream!? Say whaaaaat?!\nI have heard great things about Kuma Snow Cream recently and finally decided to try it out with some friends!\n\nFirst of all, let's start with the ambiance--I have to say, it is beyond adorable in there! I am a sucker for modern and white furniture. How cute is that thing! (Is that a bear? I don't know.) It really is adorable! I was there around 8 pm and it wasn't busy at all. Oh, and the service is great, too! As a first timer, they were patient with me and gladly got me through the process of choosing the base, toppings, and sauce!\n\nNow, for the actual product... I have to be honest. I was thoroughly disappointed with this. I had the mango snow cream with peaches, mangoes, and condensed milk. Pretty basic! Can't really screw it up, and nothing too exotic for the first try. Right? Sigh. It just wasn't good. The texture was interesting (in a good way) but the snow cream itself didn't taste like anything. I didn't taste \""mango\"", and mango was what I had expected... I'm not even sure I tasted any condensed milk. I found myself just eating the fruit while I kind of just let the snow cream plop in its container. Yes. \""Plop\"".\n\nAnyway, I really am sad this wasn't what I thought it'd be. Did I just get the wrong flavor? Was it just an \""off\"" day for mango snow cream? I don't know. Nevertheless, I think I'm willing to give it another try sometime!"
0,"This was my worst hotel experience ever. The heat in our room made so much noise I could not sleep. At 4:00 am I still was not asleep so I went to to get another room but they said I would have to wake my boss up in order to move rooms, she's a heavy sleeper i'm not. I had a very important business meeting the next day they did not care or show any sympathy to my situation. I ended up not sleeping the whole entire night. When my boss woke up at 6:30 we went down again to change rooms, again they did not care the least about the situation. We did switch rooms i missed the meeting prep and went to the meeting with 3 hours of sleep. It was the worst hotel experience I have ever had. I do not see the difference in the end they had to clean two rooms, and they had two very unhappy. The worst part of it was how little they cared, and it wasn't just one staff member it was multiple staff members with the same attitude."
1,I went there on a Sunday night so the place was fairly dead however the staff was great and even gave us some cards to enjoy the games for 15 minutes so that we could have fun while we hung out.  It was a great vibe and it seems like it would be a cool place to hang when there are other people around.  The animal art on the wall was a little strange but it added to the eclectic nature of this great place!
0,"well, i've yet to see if they actually solved the problem with my phone.. so maybe i'll up a star if it works. but the experience was pretty \""eh\"" at this verizon store.\ni came in with a memory problem on my phone - it was saying there was no available space when there was next to nothing taking up the space to begin with. the sales associate suggested i try a software update, which of course, i couldn't do because of the lack of space. so then she suggested a factory reset. (i'm really hoping this works considering the phone started doing this even after it was relatively new so i'm not quite sure how resetting it will solve the problem anyway...) and while it was resetting, she proceeded to flirt with an ex-employee who happened to stop by.\nthe associate was friendly enough, but didn't seem particularly knowledgeable. now, this is the first time i've been to this store, so it may be just that particular employee but it didn't reflect well on my visit."
1,"The food has always been consistent when we come here. Best of all, it gets to you fast, hot, fresh AND CORRECT. I am always amazed when we go, sit down and order, how quickly my order gets to my table. Great place."
1,"I took my Yelp friend Irene V. here the other day to get a pedicure with me and I was not surprised when she said she loved the place!  \nSigh, I'd let you in on my secret haven. Imagine the Barber Shop, that the kind of place this is in real life. Place is clean, unpretentious and the price extremely reasonable. There are two ladies there who does the pedi and mani. A spa pedi is $22 (only!) and a gel French manicure is $25 (only!). I have been going to Traci but both Traci and Eva will do a fantastic job. \nThey also have hair cut, coloring, lash extension, and facial services. \nWhat I mean though about it being like the Barber Shop is that I do on occasion go in to shoot the breeze with the ladies. Both of them are extremely nice and friendly and we will sit around and chat as though we're sitting on a front porch somewhere waving our fans, having lemonade. \nThere you have it- the best kept secret and my safe haven has been yelped!!!\nWell, guess these ladies are so nice and so great- everyone should know about them. Except of course when I want to get my nails done or go in for a chat!!!!"
1,I have seen both Dr. Dye and Dr. Eckhart for separate issues and look forward to each visit as I know I am in good hands and getting my health on the right track!  Erin and Jill are super helpful as well.  I have referred others to Aletris with trust that they will be taken care of with great compassion and professionalism.  I value the holistic approach with great appreciation for being seen as a human rather than a set of symptoms.  My voice is heard as a valuable tool in the treatment plan and makes me so appreciative of functional medicine rather than just taking a prescription to mask discomfort.  Thank you for all you do!
0,"yes, it's a one star and it's to stand against the five star reviews because I had the flip side of the coin experience.\n\nwe went in and the chef was in a frenzy because she was also the waiter.  I felt a little bad because 10 people came in the space of five minutes so, put her in an awkward spot.  I tried ordering an app the scallop one looked good and she told me she ran out of scallops. I asked if she could substitute it with something else.  I was told it wouldn't be possible because she was too busy between taking orders and cooking.\n\nThat seemed reasonable enough.  little disappointed but no fazed.  I ordered the chicken ravioli which is a misnomer because it's straight up chinese dumplings.  they were bland like the other yelpers mentioned. \n\nI ordered the linguini and red curry.  I asked for the red curry spicy number one.\n\nI got the linguini and it was too spicy.  She took it back and told me \""you should know basil sauce is spicy.\"" \n\nno, i didn't know I should know.  \n\nthe male owner came by and said the same thing.  I told him he should mark it on the menu as spicy.  then he went on to say that each dish is authentic and they don't cater to americans.  that was the end for me.\n\nbut, the food?\n\nthe linguini that I had one bite of tasted like pad see ew with al dente pad thai noodles.  I don't get what anyone is praising it over.  I don't think using linguini noodles and keeping the traditional recipe categorize it as fusion.\n\nthe red curry was thin.  good flavor though.  i hate thin curry.  \n\nmy experience went from mediocre to bad.  I'm not trying to bash the owners but, mediocre thai food plus bad experience is a bad combo.\n\nThe best thai still is komol, lotus of siam, thai place on washington and decatur (forgot the name) and siri (a great neighborhood thai place) in that order."
1,"**Original review from 5/5/2011. Updating new profile.**\n\nAnother place I must visit when I'm out in Vegas. Of course, I've only been here 3 times and each time I get the same thing. Lump Crab Eggs Benedict. Heaven in my mouth! I don't come here for the coffee, which is drinkable, but not the best. I come here for this heavenly lump crab dish.... and the deli/bakery items. My mom had me try the potato cakes last time we were there and..... excuse me. Had to take a breather. Just thinking about those delicious, wonderful potato concoctions with the apple sauce.... Yummmmmmmmm.\n\nThe cafe service has been great for me each time. The last time I was there was on a Sunday morning and they were jam packed!!! The waitress was great and attentive, even though the place was packed. On busy days, I understand poaching eggs can be a little difficult because there's a lot more to pay attention to, so when I pointed out that my eggs had been overcooked, without hesitation, she comped me for one of my favorite things in the bakery. (I didn't want them remade.... they were still edible)\n\nThe bakery staff is why this place didn't receive a 5 star rating from me. Since I'm still new to the place, I didn't know that you had to stand in line at the deli to get service at the bakery. No one spoke up and when I tried to get the attention of one of the guys, I was blown off. When I finally received service, I placed my order and then asked for something from the deli. He treated my request as a big inconvenience. Needless to say, if it's a busy day, I'll just eat at the cafe and leave my bakery/deli order for another, less busy time.\n\nTheir food is great. Their bakery and deli items are delicious. I would recommend this place to everyone and anyone, but I would tell them to be patient and try to go when it's not so busy."
0,"After a few visits where I was quite happy with the food I went again today and was hugely disappointed.  I don't know if they're focusing on their upcoming 2nd location or what but the quality of the food just isn't the same, nor was it for my dining companion who was also disappointed with the brisket he ordered.   I got the 'special' of the day, a 3 piece fried chicken dinner w/one side for $9.95, white meat costs $1.00 extra.   I've never seen such small pieces of chicken, looked more like cornish hen.  I received 2 wings & one drumstick..what..no thigh available?  The side was a very small serving of what was supposed to be spicy beans.  The beans were not spicy and they were also lukewarm.  We both felt totally ripped off and I'm taking this place off my rotation.  Benched!"
0,"Had high expectations going in as Mario Batali had become such a big time famous chef.   Tried several things on the menu and everything was mediocre at best.   I would have thought that Mario could at least of put on some amazing pasta dishes on the menu, but really nothing was all that special.    Would not have mind paying the expensive prices if the food was up to par"
1,"Great food, but you have to have a designated amount of time blocked off to eat here."
0,"went for Dim Sum, I asked for water, the waitress kept insisting that I get tea also. I finally said fine. She brought 2 tea cups, which by the way, one was for me the other person with me is my 3 year old son. Does he drink hot tea, I think not. There must be something to it. \n\nI keep wanting to get the satay hot sauce, and asked several ladies pushing the carts, they keep telling me \"" ask the waitress.\"" I haven't seen a waitress pass for any request. when I finally raised my voice to get the attention of a waitress, she said we only have 1 type of hot sauce. \nNOT REAL AUTHENTIC dim sum, if they do not have the satay hot sauce. \n\nThe fried shrimp balls was OK, a bit dry. The steam rice noodle with beef on the inside, was weird. Noodles too chewy, and the beef seems like it was from some kind of beef paste, (its and Asian thing) \n\nI did like the siu-mai though, it was good. seems like it was steam with little fish eggs on top. \n\nI got my check, they actually charge $.50 for tea for each person. That was why the waitress keep wanting me to say yes for tea. Forget the $ amount, it's the principles of the matter. \n\nSo I will keep to my usual favorite place Cathay House, in china town for Dim Sum. Good food, good service."
0,"Mostly ok service, but two strikes and you are out...\nSecond ride from these guys, the driver is heading to the airport.  You know that big flat plot of asphalt with all the big noisy things going up and down?  This guy didn't know.  He gets on the 202W from Priest, in the left (\""AIRPORT\"") lane, then at the last second veers over to the right (\""202\"") lane.  Had to take the next exit and go around.  Almost missed my flight.  A week later a different guy (they're all different) tries to take backroads.  I direct him to the 202, and the fare ends up being $19+.  I think: maybe it's a lot longer to go the highway than the usual small roads.  So next time out I go the exact same route and watch the meter.  Under $11.\nTake them if you must, but copy down the cab number and name, if you can make it out."

1,"This review is for the Spa at GVR...\n\nIt was amazing.  They now offer 20% off 7 days a week for vegas residents.  The massage was amazing.  I had Jodi, and she was awesome!  It was relaxing, and perfect.  The only thing i would have hoped of more for was more co-ed stuff.  They only had 1 jacuzzi where i could hang out with my boyfriend before/after our massages."
1,"Both dishes were excellent.  From the specials menu: Lamb Tacos and Chicken Enchilada.  The Enchilada had a roasted pepper sauce and over easy eggs on top.  Such a perfect combination.\n\nThere were many unique margarita options as well.  Service was thorough and snappy.  Plus they provided endless fancy pitchers of water, and who doesn't need that while in Vegas?"
0,My girlfriend took my mini Australian Shepard here today as this is where her doggie goes. I'm not sure what was going through their mind when they shaved her all the way down. Seems to like there were lazy and didn't want to take the time to give her a proper groom. Hair was unevenly cut. She's a long haired mini Australian Shepard. Nobody wants this dog to look like a rat. You will never have my business again. Elite grooming on rainbow will continue to get my business as usual.
1,"If you ever find yourself in Vegas, you must make sure to stop at the landmark that is the Peppermill Inn Restaurant. \nI had heard about the Peppermill from my brother in law who insisted multiple times that I make a stop there during my stay in Sin City. When I went this last January, I finally made the time to get over there for a 3:00pm breakfast. If I knew what I know now about the Peppermill, I'd beat my own ass for not going sooner.\nThe lettering on the outside said a lot when I see \""PEPPERMILL\"" spelled out in a rainbow of neon lights.  My friend Kristina and I skipped in excitement through the doors and entered in jaw-dropping bewilderment. Chills ran down our spines as we were slapped in the face with what I can only describe as pure neon splendor. A resounding WOW was all we could say until the hostess made us snap out of it and asked how many in out party. I couldn't help but ask her, \""Do you get a headache working here?\"" She giggled and said,\"" When I first started, I thought there was no way I could work here for long, but you get use to it.\"" \nAs she led us through the forest of silk trees and flowers to our table, we admired her classicly tacky floral uniform and shimmery tights. I've never been more jealous of a working environment. The menu was large and filled with a huge assortment of breakfast, lunch, and dinner items.. always being served.\nI called my brother in law for \""must-haves\"" and was told to get the Bloody Mary, among other specialties. I went ahead and ordered my Tower of Bloody Mary and it was amazing. I'm a sucker for biscuits and gravy, so we ordered that.. along with the Fantasia waffle. A belgian waffle covered in fresh fruit, blueberry syrup and choice of whipped cream or sour cream. We ate until we thought we would explode, but the fun didn't end there.\nRumors of the breathtaking \""Fireside Lounge\"" and it's famous fire pit drew us to it's glory. If I thought the neon goodness was only in the restaurant, I was extremely mistaken. Take all the yummy neon lights, then dim the rest of the lights, add some pink couches and cocktail waitresses in gowns and full make-up (no matter the time of day).. you have yourself the Fireside Lounge. Oh wait! It gets better... The FIRE PIT!! I've never seen anything so amazing. Imagine a tiny jacuzzi with fire coming out of it and the vent lined with little TV's showing the hottest sporting event. Nothing short of fantastic. We sunk into a spot around the fire and it took Superman's will power to get us up and out of there. \nDo yourself a favor. Go to the Peppermill. If not for the decor, do it for the food. Yummy!"
0,"Okay, so first off, I'm an Italian from NY who has been in Vegas for 2 years and I'm still in search of an Italian restaurant that I can frequent.  My husband and I came here for our anniversary dinner and because we had $20 off with our new entertainment book that we just got recently.  \n\nNormally I have no problem paying a little more for food, provided it is good.  SO, I'd have to say that I'm really glad we had a $20 off coupon to eat here.  \n\nThe food itself is deserving of 2 stars but I gave the place 3 stars because it's cute inside and Brad, our server, was really nice.  My hope for him is that he will someday wait tables at a place that actually serves decent food.\n\nSo, on to the actual food..\n\nWe started out with fried calamari, which was pretty good.  The sauce that came with was actually decent as well. No issues here.\n\nI ordered Eggplant Parm and my husband is a Chicken Parm fan.. For the money they charge for the entrees, $19 and $24 respectively, I would have hoped for more food.  Italian food is all about portions, and of course flavor, but you won't get rave reviews from me unless you actually FEED ME... Casa di amore didn't do this well.\n\nMy husbands chicken came with a steak knife, which, most people eating chicken parm would need.. My dinner also came with a steak knife.. first thoughts were \""Why the hell would I need a steak knife for eggplant? I should be able to eat this with just a fork, no problem.\"" BOY WAS I WRONG. Holy crap I could barely cut with it the steak knife it was so hard. With the time it took for them to actually COOK the meal, it should have been mush on the plate. Definitely NOT impressed with this at all.\n\nI'm starting to think that the reason why there are no good Italian places in Vegas is because all of the REAL Italians stayed in the Tri-State area."
1,"Nickys thai on Western ave on Pittsburghs North shore is outstanding! I have seen one reviewer slam this place on a few different sites.  I have no idea where this venom comes from.  Every time i have eaten here, and every meal my wife and friends have eaten here, has been great. I would give 5/5 stars, but no one deserves that ;).  The staff is great. The food is great. No liquor license, but you can BYOB and no corkage fee.  I am military. I have friends w/Thai wives. I have eaten Thai in LA, Boston, San Fran, numerous other cities.  This place is at least as good as any other restaurant or HOME I have eaten.  The menu is great.  The wait staff is great.  One night, my wife droppedher water glass on the table. It shattered and ruined our food.  The staff came out cleaned it all up and brought us new meals gratis.  All without a single cross look or word.  Like I said at the beginning I don't know why a person would sl this place not once but several times.  I just have to try and set the record straight.  Oh and the interior is flat out gorgeous as well!"
1,"Oh I love you you darling little place!  My long-time boyfriend worked at a video game development company in the area and every time I would meet him for lunch there was never a question:  We were having Pie Zanos.\n\nThe line always looks intimidating, but don't be fooled!  They will move you through!\n\nYou pick your dough, you pick your crust flavorings/seasonings, you pick your amazing (glorious) toppings... \n\nIf you love fun food, fast food, and GREAT food - have Pie Zanos!"
1,"I wasn't expecting to be, but I was super impressed with my stay here. I booked a room for after Thunder from Down Under was hosted here so we could avoid driving after what was sure to be drunken evening. \n\nThe room was super nice and modern. The beds were ultra comfy, the room was spacious and well decorated. They have the cool coffee maker that allows for individual cups. The bathroom was large and had a waterfall shower (which I didn't get a chance to use, unfortunately) and a giant bathtub. The lighting in the bathroom wasn't so great for getting ready, but they have a close up make up mirror attached to the wall which was really nice except that I didn't want to see all my facial flaws that close! \n\nThe hotel itself was well kept and the staff was courteous. There are two pools although I didn't stay at either for an extended period of time. At the main pool, there were plenty of lounge chairs available and the pool was well sized. It would have been nice to have a few more umbrellas so I could move to the shade when my pastiness started burning, but oh well. There was also no attendant at the towel station when we went on Sunday which I thought was odd. The smaller pool was nicer in my opinion. Fewer lounge chairs but also fewer kids and there was a speaker playing music which was nice. \n\nThe casino is pretty decent, not my favorite in the valley, but still a good selection of slots, tables and poker for whatever tickles your fancy. They also host a 5:00 toast every evening in the main bar which was kind of cool and I enjoyed the complimentary margarita, yum! \n\nI only ate in the Blue Coyote Cafe as it was the only place that offered a variety of Vegan selections for my sis and both times it was pretty good. There was a long wait for seating so we opted for the bar both times and it was a good choice. The bartenders were super friendly and chatted with us while we waited. I had the nachos which were delishhhh as well as the veggie sushi roll and the lo mein noodle bowl (I think that's what it was). The hummus was pretty bland though, so I'd advise skipping that. The service was prompt and the restaurant, from what I could see from the bar, was well maintained. \n\nAfter the show, we went to the night club upstairs and it wasn't really anything special. There is one bar and a big open section for dancing and such with a few big open spaces off to the left. The patio was super small, so smoking was really inconvenient and there were only two stalls in the ladies room which made for a painfully long wait. \n\nAlthough I enjoyed almost every aspect of my stay, I do have one major complaint...parking is in the garage and the entrance to the hotel (which was hard to locate) is across the casino, so we had to drag our bags by many onlookers which was not fun considering the amount of clothing I packed...\n\nSo after my extremely long winded review, I'll recap short and sweet by saying that this was well worth the $109 I paid and we had an amazing time. I would return for sure."
1,The filet mignon is to DIE for. ;) also I recommend the smoked ham and sharp cheddar cheese for an appetizer...
1,"This truck was parked outside my office yesterday so I went to check it out. I got the Gangsta Grilled cheese. I've got to say, it was delicious! I though it could use more meat; I only had a little piece in my whole grilled cheese but the flavors were fantastic. Nice work."
0,"Never mix Johnnie Walker with Panda Express = NO BUENO. I ordered the fried rice and orange flavor chicken followed up with a brisk rasberry ice tea. Normally I would enjoy that mix but not this time. I took four bites, pushed my tray forward, then passed out as if I was back in my stats class in college. All while: Eugine Y, Johnny G, Reid Y were taking pics of me.\n\nNever again shall I eat this while intoxicated."
1,"This place is amazing... had all of my pants hemmed here and they always did a fantastic job at VERY cheap prices. They knew me by name after a few visits, and even let me in a few times after closing. If I needed something back fast they were always accommodating. I even had a bridesmaid dress altered here and they did it for under $50 - can't complain at all!!!!"
0,"2 stars only because I liked the therapist and the spa attendant was really nice. The actual spa had very little appeal. I'm used to going to Qua and Canyon Ranch- admittedly I'm a little spa spoiled- but for the same price Qua is a MUCH better experience. \n\nThe spa was dated and dirty. The lockers were a little sticky (how scary is that?). There were 4 showers- 2 were out of order. They ran out of towels by the shower area. The door handle inside of the dry cedar sauna burnt my hand. \n\nThe thing that made up my mind that I am never ever going back to this place again was that my service was $130. When I went to pay at the end, they said it was $156. I had to ask how much was the massage. Then they told me a 20% tip was included. I am a solid believer in tipping. After all, I've worked for tips most of my life. I never believe in adding gratuity as a requirement. The whole point of the tipping system is to tip depending on how the service was. Sometimes I tip a lot for great service and I tip normal for mediocre or poor service. I would like to have the option. Also irked at the fact that they didn't tell me until I asked. One more reason why I will not go back to this spa is because they tried to sell me their products. They weren't as pushy as the spa attendants on the cruise ships (same company), but I don't appreciate them pushing their products on to me. Perhaps if they just update their facilities, they will have enough business and not have to sell their lotions and vitamins to make money. \n\nOn a bright note though, my massage therapist was really good. And she didn't talk to me in that don't-rile-up-the-mental patient tone. The spa attendant was also very nice- all 3 foot 7 of her. \n\nOverall, IMO, for the price you pay, it's just not worth it"
1,"Oh my god amazing!\n\nSuch a great find in Vegas.  Delicious cheap food, there for you whenever you could possibly be hungry.\n\nThe tomato soup is incredible.\n\nI will be here often during all of my future Vegas trips."
1,"Last night while i was drunk as heck coming back from a party, my friends and I collectively decided that we were extremely hungry. It was 2 in the morning and not a whole lot of choices came to mind. That is is until my friend suggested the 24 hours federicos. \n\nThere was a drive through and the service was fast and simple. I got the carne asada buritto with sour cream and pico, with a little quacamole. It was made quicky and i have to tell you that each and every bite i took of that mama jama was equal to heaven. \n\nThe buritto was huge. And freakin heavy. Every bite was filled with carne and sour cream. It was funny because my friend was like \""take a few bites and we will eat the rest when we get home\"" , but i couldnt stop. I devoured the entire beast within minutes and I was satisfied."
0,Never again...never again!!' This place is terrible!!!!!!! I would never go here. Save your money!!!!!!!!!!
0,These guys are woman hating misogynists who named their bar after a Jack Black movie. That should say it all.
0,"They need a new crew at the location immediately. The food is so horrible my kid wouldn't eat it, bc it had no flavor. Everything is always bland and the line has crumbs littered everywhere. This is the worst chipotle I've ever been to in my life. I'm a regular so I know bad chipotle when I see one. They don't pay attention to your request, so you have to repeat you order over and over. That's the third time this has happened in a month. I'm done personally, save your time and avoid this location. Drive to the camelback location or go downtown. Trust me!"
0,"I'm not sure how to write a recommendation about a place I haven't actually been in but I've tried to go here twice and haven't made it in the establishment yet! Last night, a Friday night, a friend and I tried to go and it was closed. Martini Bar, Closed at 9pm on a Friday night????? In Vegas no less?? We arrived about 9:10pm, a couple was sitting outside having a cocktail and there were several people inside around the bar clearly having a good time. The owner came to the locked door and informed me that they were closed. Perplexed because there were people inside and outside the establishment, I walked away thinking of a plan B. In my world, when you are closed, you are closed.... everyone get out and go home. Closed but we'll remain open for a select few makes me wonder about this place. The first time I went was an early afternoon on a weekday, Happy Hour time but they weren't open till 5pm. It seems like this place has a pretty small window of opportunity to make money and do well in this town. I'm not sure I'll try again so I wish them luck."
1,"I don't even know where to begin!\n\nFood, ambiance, service, atmosphere, everything was above and beyond. \n\nWe were shopping at the Union and decided to stay there for dinner. Place looked great but since we never tried their food we were not sure what to expect. And then...What an amazing surprise...\n\nThe food was absolutely amazing. I had tomato basil soup, which was amazing. Then for the main course I ordered Baby Octopus that was served with mashed potatoes, old bay aioli and breadcrumbs. It was out of this world. The portion was really small but you do not want plate of entire octopus on it...just saying. \n\nMy boyfriend had Mushroom pizza with house made sausage, garlic and thyme. He was as well blown away. I had to have a piece because it looked so good and I didn't want him to eat entire pizza by him self . The crust was awesome. It was tender but yet crispy throughout.  It was full of flavors. I had to pick sausages out as I do not eat pork but he said they were the bomb. \n\nDrinks were to die for as well. We had Ways&Means (bourbon, sweet vermouth, 2 bitters, maple) and High Tide (gin, orange, lime, mint). They were very different from each other but flavors were amazing on both. \n\nService was just out of this world as well. Our server was really helpful by explaining the Menu, checking on us in timely manner and getting us exactly what we needed when we needed it. \n\nThis is a kind of a place that I will keep going back to. They have a beautiful fire pit outside, which is perfect to have a drink by on the semi-cold Phoenix nights. \n\nThank you unique but absolutely amazing Forge and crew, we will be coming back for sure!"
1,"Years ago as a kid growing up in Musselburgh, one of the challenges thrown down in front of you would be - which ice cream do you like more, Luca's or Di Rollo's?\n\nHands down, my response for the past 25 *cough cough* years has been Luca's. I wouldn't even sniff in the direction of Di Rollo's. But... you know what, time can change the old taste buds, and I can definitely say now that I have more than a little love for Di Rollo. It tastes creamier, I like the different flavours (raspberry ripple for the win! As is coconut). So now I tend to walk on the wild side, my opinions change, and I go against the tide of Luca's fans. \n\nNom."
0,"THIS HOTEL IS A HORROR!  I find it hard to believe that anyone who has ever stayed at a hotel before, (anywhere & any rating all the way from the Holiday Inn to the Four Seasons), would write a positive review for this spot.\n\nI have nothing but negative things to say...\nI will elaborate when I check out. But for the time being I will say that the worst part is that I paid & furthermore splurged on this, my vacation...something I haven't done in years.  It also happened to be my bday & it was ruined by the unprofessisonal and imcompetance of the linq-i missed a bday dinner, a concert and worst of all-good times & memories...ultimately, all this was was money & time flushed down the drain. They didnt take accountability either & blammed hotels.com...i have photos/videos/& record from hotels.com as documentation to prove this to be true. \nThe one star I gave is for brooklyn bowl, otherwise if yelp allowed for it, i wouldn't give one at all.\n\nUPDATE:\nThe entire day I've called to request a blanket that every other room has on their bed. I spoke with someone more then 5x. Each time they either ignored or forgotten about my request OR are they are actually incompetant, which I'm starting to believe to be the reason.\n\nA pool is advertised, there is no pool. It is under construction. \n\nThe room service only operates from 7AM-1PM. \n\nElevators are for the most part broken & don't always run...best option is to use the stairs. \n\nMANAGMENT IS COMPLETELTY UNQUALIFIED TO OVERSEE A HOTEL & WITH THAT, A NEW HOTEL IN LAS VEGAS...ONE OF THE MOST POPULAR  DESTINATION SPOTS IN THE WORLD.  I FEEL LIKE THEY OWE ME $ FOR WASTING MY VACATION TIME, THEIR FALSE ADVERTISING, INABILITY TO ACCOMADATE & UNHOSPITALITY.\n\nDon't bother booking anything but a standard room because they ignore requests and will put u in a standard room, which I'm assuming is all they really have...\n\nHORRIBLE.  DON'T LET THIS HOTEL STEAL YOUR MONEY."
0,"Had bad service and bad shrimp.  Can't comeback from serving bad shrimp or should I say prawns. If it was good,3 stars at the most."
1,"This place was just great. The food was fantastic, the atmosphere was cozy and comfortable and the service was professional. \n\nAs already mentioned,  the food was just delicious - especially if you like mushrooms, lots of options for great mushroom dishes; wild mushroom consumme, mushroom and brie crostini, spinach salad  - add mushrooms,  a stuffed chicken with mushrooms entree...clearly, I'm a fan of mushrooms.\n\nBYOB - fabulous. Corkage fee was only two dollars a glass. I love a good BYOB, these restaurants aren't concerned with the profit of alcohol - they are in it to make really, really good food. That's awesome. \n\nThe space is small, probably only five or six tables - though in the summer I hear they have a gorgeous back patio - and there is an open kitchen. The service was...leisurely - due to the small kitchen. It was fine for our evening - girls night out with holiday grab bag gifts, a bottle of Prosecco (where we had asked them for champagne glasses which they washed and gave to us) and two bottles of wine. The place is made for dining, not for a quick dinner. \n\nCould have been a little cleaner , waitress could have been a little friendlier -  she was professional, but just a hint cold. Ultimately though, very satisfied. A must go for foodies in Pittsburgh.\n\nBe sure to make a reservation!"
0,"I was excited to get a group of 5 great friends together for a light brunch and several rounds of bloody Mary's. My excitement did not last long. The bloody Mary was so bland, it tasted like plain tomato juice with black pepper... However, this was not the worst part, that was they way my crepe tasted. I'm a lover of crepes. I learned how to make them as a child and they're my Go-To brunch indulgence. Now when you eat something that you love and you're confidant that you have healthy taste buds, you get very disappointed when your food tastes bad. Where I was hoping to find a delicious nutella and banana flavor, I was taken aback by the overwhelming taste of oil. Not delicious. \n\nChefs can have an off day and food can turn, I get it. I don't get how a Server can then attempt to make a customer feel guilty or stupid if they send the plate back. I've worked in the service industry for many years and sending food back, gives the restaurant a chance to turn your experience around. If you messed up once, it's totally forgivable, however if you then give a crappy response to the customer, you're officially a sucky server. \n\nBummed that I had such a poor experience at this cute little neighborhood eatery and even more bummed that I didn't get to enjoy a tasty crepe. \n\nCrepe-lessly yours,\n\nJoan"
1,"Best show I've seen in Vegas.  The lady who let us in also bumped us up to the 5th row, which was incredible.  Thank you whoever you are!\n\nThe show itself is amazing.  I disagree with Danni H.; I thought the stage was excellent.  I liked the sparsity of the stage, and how they managed to make it work with every scene; it definitely took a lot of choreography and planning to get it to work so smoothly.\n\nThe songs were very good, and you almost want to get up and start singing along, but PLEASE DON'T.  A woman sitting right behind us did that during the show, and thank goodness she moved to the side because she almost ruined it for everybody.  The actors were brilliant."
1,Came here on a Monday night and place was deserted but the crew in the back was hustling and bustling like it was lunch hour. The cashier Geovani was extremely helpful and polite which you don't see in a teenager this day. I asked him to explain to me what animal style was and he explained it so well to a first timer. Our food was freshly made and tasty but is a bit salty.
0,Fuck this place it's shit. What a joke. How about adding some booze to the shitty margaritas. The 70 volt audio system is shit absolute shit.  Thanks for the shiity microwaved fish tacos and the reconstituted dog food quesadilla.  Fuck it.
1,"Wow, first of all, I'm from Socal and I didn't expect to find a gem of a sushi joint like this in vegas.\n\nDidn't feel like paying big bucks for overrated pricey sushi joints on the strip, so we decided to hit this place up as a recommendation from a friend.\n\nI was blown away by how many items they had on their AYCE menu. Suppppper thrilled to order every single item possible to try.\n\nTheir nigiri was superb because the fish was really fresh and sweet. The best has to be the white tuna! The sweet shrimp and uni definitely had to be my favorite, and it sucked that you can only order it once.\n\nAll their rolls were very unique and each one satisfied my tastebuds. The best part was that they allowed half orders on the rolls, so you can try more!\n\nThe icing on the cake was the selection of ice cream at the end. From tempura, to mochi, to red bean... It was heaven\n\nCan't wait to come back to Vegas in 2 weeks and hit up this spot again. BEST AYCE sushi I've ever had, and that's coming a lot from someone who's had multiple hot spots in socal. \n\nTHUMBS WAY UP"
1,cant say enough LOVE this place a little packed on the weekends wish the would take reservations...but worth the wait from the food to the sangria NO complaints located near the strip
1,"Our last place we visited before coming home from Vegas. Thank you YELP for letting me find you. This place was the Bomb.com. I loveddd it!!  This place was super packed however we only had to wait 5 minutes before getting seated. Simple menu on paper but tons of options. I ordered the Chicken Skillet, my husband ordered the chocolate chip pancakes.  Both items were reallyyyy good however the chocolate chip pancakes were total overload, the pancakes were drenched in chocoalte chips and i love chocolate but it was a little too much actually not a little just TOO MUCH for my liking even my teeth starting to hurt because of the sweetness.\nThe prices were really reasonable and food was good and the service was awesome especially for how busy it was all.  \n\nYou must visit this place! yummmmy!"
0,"this was the first time in this place, we wanted pizza and stopped here.\nthe pizza:\nthe crust had to be frozen,barely cooked and so disgustingly saggy in oil.\nthe sauce was the most horrifying experience in my life, so gross,sweeten with sugar, it must be because they are definitely using can pizza sauce .\nthe cheese was not cheese, it tasted like rubber,i picked up the stupidly cut small square and the whatever was came off all together..rubber!\nwe order half spinach and half pepperoni, it was so damn oily, the spinach was very salty and the pepperoni (very little) probably the cheapest brand you can get.\ni was very surprise how busy they were, i just can not  understand why a person that like good food (like me) would come back in here.\nthis was the most disgusting PIZZA THAT I EVER TRIED IN MY LIFE..frozen pizza from walmart is 100% times better.\nand the damn thing (i can't call it pizza anymore) was $22 for a 16\"".\nwaist of money,time and my stomach hurt like hell.\nTERRIBLE!\nDo not go!"
1,"LOVE this place!! They have the BEST bread period, ever. It's called Wunderful Bread, they're chocolate chip  cookies are amazing too"
0,"This is up there on the BAD FOOD LIST.  I had to walk into T.I. to ask about the Cirque show which apparently was dark, so we couldn't see it.  Saw Senor Frogs and went in since I was hungry and tired of walking and the wind was blowing insanely.\n\nWell here's the bad:  the menu is really small and everything is overpriced! Chips and salsa were $6 (not kidding at all).  I got a mango spice margarita and it tasted like OJ and hot sauce. My girlfriend tasted it and made a disgusted face.   I asked the server politely to top it off as it was too spicy and it came back spicy again.  I tried to be a good sport and drink it, but it was burning my esophagus.  Did I ask for cold liquefied salsa and sugar in a cup? Ewww.  Also, it was in one of those clear plastic cups from the dollar store.  For the prices, the could use better cups!\n\nI do not recommend this place to anyone."
0,"Just got here for CES. I came here last year and it was great, but this year things have changed.\n\nCheck in - I may have gotten the wrong guy (James), because he was so much less nice and accommodating than the guy at the desk next to him. The hotel gives every guest complimentary water - he did not offer me one. He didn't tell me my room number. He gave me a room that is right next to the highway and super loud. Plus, and this is not James' fault, there are tons of nicks in the desk and the bed pillow looks dirty and old. Contrast this with the check in desk next to me. The guest arrived after me, was offered water instantly, was given her credit card total, and got checked in within half the time. I did call the desk to see if there were any quieter rooms available and they said no  - now that we've got you in a room, you're in. Maybe you can change tomorrow. Maybe I should've mentioned the dirty pillows?"
1,To get more detailed I would give it a 3.7. The highlight of this place are the drinks and desserts. The meals are above average but it wasn't as great as I expected it to be.
1,"First let me say I'm not your average customer. I have been to hundreds of different Chinese restaurants around the world and I'm going to own one very soon.  This place is pretty decent. I think you won't beat it for the price. 11 bucks for all u can eat crab legs, fresh oysters, sushi, baked Salmon, squid and of course all your regular Chinese buffet items. We enjoy it and we're pretty picky. And u know what were not fighting to get crab legs when they come out like buffets in chandler. And I dont know the owners just thought some of the reviews were misrepresenting how this place really is. Try them, their flavors are very good! Something makes me think there are other places jealous of them around here and talking sh!!!.."
0,"It was okay...\n\nmore topping choices, but no better than In and Out Burger. Twice as expensive. The fries were unique but i didn't care for them too much. It was cold and loud inside. Meh whatever."
1,"This place is amazing!  Wow, I didn't know vegetarian food could taste so good.  And the service is really good.  General Tzu's \""chicken\""  was the best!"
1,"Groupon breakfast!!! Came here with a friend who loves breakfast. I've been trying to find more country style breakfasts in the area since I get a little homesick sometimes. The inside of the restaurant is quite cute and reminds me of some of the restaurants back in Roswell, GA that I frequented as a child. The menus took us a while to browse. My friend had the biscuits and gravy and I had the country fried steak and eggs. Our server was really nice and friendly and took our Groupon right away (which I like cuz then it's not sitting there getting food on it). My entree came with a side so I picked the apple fritter (which was a pleasant surprise since it was huge and crispy and delicious). The meal was quite awesome and a pleasant surprise since I wasn't sure what to expect of a country style breakfast place in the middle of China Town. Will definitely be back the next time I'm homesick."
0,"I asked for extra crispy hot wings and received soggy, rubbery, undercooked chicken swimming in a pool of buffalo sauce. Spent the rest of the night and the following day in a fetal position as my stomach wouldn't stop hurting. I would never suggest this place to anyone. Ever."
1,"Hey guys! ALWAYS get an extra shot in your slushy, girly drink! Trust me!!!\n\nWe bought two huge pina coladas and didn't even feel tipsy after downing the whole thing. \nBut, when we went to the one at the pool, we got two small pink vodka lemonades with an extra shot, and we were good to go! All drunk by the pool, hell yeah! It was an awesome morning :)\n\nAt the inside location at MGM Grand, the bartender gave us free jello shots. Really nice gesture, but man they were NASTY!"
0,"BEWARE!! \n\nI had my car serviced here. Before leaving, the Pep Boys employee who handled my payment verbally told me that my car was in good shape and had no other recommendations for maintenance, which seemed reasonable, as it was showing no signs of problems. Following the oil change, I drove home (approximately 3 miles), where the car sat for approximately one hour. I then drove from my home approximately 7 miles where the car engine was stopped for 15-20 minutes. \n\nShortly after starting my vehicle and driving less than 2 more miles, the engine temperature gauge spiked to the maximum and the engine began chugging. I immediately turned the car off and pulled to the side of the road, in an effort to avoid any further damage to my car. Then my car was towed to a more trusted shop across town. When examining my car, the mechanics at a more trusted shop found that the radiator coolant cap was left off the fill neck and was lying on top of the engine. \n\nPhotos of the cap location were taken once the hood of the vehicle was lifted (cap was not moved by the trusted mechanic); including three images showing the coolant fill neck and the cap. The other photo showed the hood liner wet from the coolant that came out. Due to the short amount of mileage that was driven, the car thankfully became operable once radiator coolant was filled and the cap placed back on. Based on the photos and a licensed mechanic's evaluation of my car, it is apparent that the Pep Boy's mechanic removed the radiator cap from my vehicle and failed to secure it back onto the radiator fill neck. However, the store manager, Jae, informed me that since I drove my car a few miles \""it must have vibrated off after service.\"" \n\n\nI may be a female, but I know that the caps have locks, AND that I have 136K miles on this car and no cap has ever \""vibrated off\"" while driving. Thanks for the advice. Really. I sent both photos, reciepts, and letters to Jae. He was unwilling to admit any fault. Go somewhere else for work on your car. Hopefully there are other shops are more helpful and honest."
0,"With a child and another one on the way, I was too busy to do basic landscaping of the front and back yard of my home, after a long term landscaper moved out of the area. I contacted Michael through craigslist, hoping to have another long term guy with the upkeep. He seemed nice at first but his services were not as promised. It was extremely difficult to get a hold of him and he seemed very understaffed. I was not at all impressed with how things were being handled. We paid him $100 to fix a leak in the backyard, which was never fixed and we never got our money back after multiple attempts of trying to reach him. In fact, our neighbor did it for free and it only took him 5 minutes. We were so disappointed and would highly recommend you don't try this company."

1,Great service. Great for families.  Wonderful food.
1,Myself and my girlfriend decided to stay here for a couple of nights while visiting Scotland and I've gotta say I was more than impressed. \n\nThe staff were so friendly and helpful and had a fantastic knowledge of places for us to go. The also gave us a discount card for one of the local pubs which was great. \nThey also did a discounted breakfast for a cafe next door which served lovely food!\n\nWe stayed in a private double room as we weren't up did bunking with loads of people. The room we stayed in was like an apartment more than a hostel. Fully kitted out with a great view if the city. \n\nThe hostel is positioned right bang in the heart of Edinburgh. Less than a ten minute walk from everything. There was so much to do and even though we were only in Scotland for a few days it was beautiful.\n\nI would recommend this place to anyone visiting Scotland and looking for cheap accommodation and great location. Loved every moment in the hostel and will be back again.
0,"would give this place negative infinity if i could. decided to give this place another shot and still kicking myself in the behind for it. my family of four came in, the restaurant full. The waiter at the counter ignored me, so i went up to tell him that i needed a table for four. we waited 15 minutes, another party of 3 comes in. after one table leaves, they wait FOREVER to clear the table, but the waiter was going to seat the party of 3 first before my family! NO YOU DON'T! Needless to say, I got my table. \n\nWe sat down and I told the waitress that we didn't need the menu as we already know what we want. She replies, \""you still have to wait\"", and walks away. \n\n10minutes later, she comes back to take our order. \n\nSo it took 20minutes for two pho sate and one mien ga (clear noodle chicken soup) to come. It took 30 minutes for a pho combination to come!!!! I've NEVER waited more than 10minutes for a pho. The porportions have shrunk, the food saltier and more oily. Found some bugs in my soup too.  the chicken in my clear noodle chicken soup was so tough--worst than jerky (like it's been refridgerated for weeks). The mints for the pho were all wilted (like reused veggies),\n\nWhile we were waiting, I was able to witness how inefficient and unsanitary these people were. the waitress at the counter (the same who took our order) was preparing ice water--She actually stuck her entire hand into a pitcher of water to remove a big junk of ice. Then when she poured some ice on the counter, she picked it up with her hands and placed it back into the pitcher. GROSS! Then we witnessed a mother and son party come in, they waited 15minutes, but instead of sitting them when a table was ready, they sat a table of 3 that just came in. The mother and son approached them and all they said was sorry, can you wait a little longer??? When she got piss and left, they just smiled and said, \""have a nice day\"". Idiots!\n\nIs it so hard to have a waiting list? They had plenty of cooks in the kitchen, why did it take forever for the food to come (it's not even cuisine food!) The food has declined drastically and the portion shrunken, not to mention how unsanitary things are. The service is SLOWER than before--there is absolutely no organization. This place needs new management. \n\nFortunately I will never be back to see that day."
1,This place is usually pretty good. Nice beer selection. Food is pretty good . Not too fancy but definitely good
0,Avoid this company at all costs.  Internet service is garbage and TV isn't much better.
0,We've been coming to The Golden Nugget annually for over 30 years. We were disappointed to see that the Carson Street Cafe was closed and Claim Jumper isn't opening until after we leave. We went to the Grotto for breakfast. What a mistake. 11.00 for bacon and eggs. TWO pieces of bacon. Is there a pork shortage or what?   $55 for three of us. The waiter was very nice which is the only reason they are getting 2 stars. Avoid at all costs. Mickey D's is right down the street.
0,"In a nutshell: Go for the burgers, skip the salads. The service? Abysmal. Details.\n\nThe line to order at the register was short. The wait to order was looonnng. Definitely training needed there as when we placed our order the chick was confused. Benefit of the doubt...maybe it was her first day. One can only hope. \n\nThe food. My Buffalo Bleu Burger made me smile from ear to ear nit only because of the crusty grilled and browned griddled burger exterior, but they put it on a GLUTEN FREE BUN! I'll go back again and again for that burger!\n\nNow the downside of the food. The salads. If you like a giant bowl of greens and not much else, maybe you'll be a happy camper, but when you're paying for a salad with corn, black beans, avocado, tortilla strips and chicken you expect to be able to find them instead of playing hide and seek. \n\nAnd back to the service. The burger was delivered to our table first. And we waited a while for the salad. When it finally arrived, there was dressing all over when the dressing was supposed to be on the side. When pointed out, the waitress (who had been the same confused chick at the register) nearly slapped her own forehead as she said aloud, \""that's right!\"" She took it back as my burger continued to cool. Clueless Chick returned with the massive pile of lettuce and dressing the side. Yay her! But this time, although the aforesaid veggies were still playing hide and seek, the chicken was missing. Up to the salad assembly line went my dining companion and eventually returned with the missing chicken. Yes, my burger was cold...And so was the \""grilled\"" newly found chicken. And it was bland and tasteless. \n\nI finished my cold-by-then burger, Kimber picked a little, trying to eat the salad but left it mostly untouched. Go for the burger, skip the salads and PRAY for better service! Maybe better yet, skip this particular location completely and hope another location is better."
1,What can you say about a swapmeet? They literally have everything you could possibly need and so much more that you don't!!! There is a vendor here that makes the most amazing little cinnamon and sugar donuts. This awesome place to spend a lazy weekend day. They are only open Fri-Sun til 6pm. When I go I take a tote bag and $40 spending money.
1,"So, I refused to go eat there for almost a year but, one day my boyfriend decided to take me in because he use to work for the owners at their previous business. At first I was alittle sketched out but to my suprise it was awesome! It was a great deal for the money and, now I go there every chance I get! If you haven't been you should totally try it out. I've been going there long since I dumped him haha. Don't be scared, it's the shack!"
1,"Really gorgeous, interior - especially if you get lucky enough to snag the big cushiony square sofa type things down the bottom!\n\nSmall but eclectic menu, with every option really tempting. The food was insanely good value, so a good starting point if you're new to Tibetan food. The curry I had was creamy, yet well seasoned and in a decent sized portion.\n\nService wasn't crazy friendly, but still pleasant and efficient. The food came out fast and we were in and out of the place in less than an hour (just what we wanted as we were exhausted upon arrival in Montreal). But the cosy surroundings and fun atmosphere ensured that we could have lounged there all night had we wanted to."
0,"well at least the service was ok. I ordered the classic meatballs. kind of chocky taste and tiny bit of sauce. got cheese on it that was extra cost. didnt help. was told by bartender they are not the best they have? classic? asked for more sauce and was charged for that and then got about 3 oz only. bread was ok but not great. ordered pizza with bacon sausage and pepperoni. small is size of cookie sheet cut into 8 slices literally with one small slice of pep, one small crumble of bacon and one small crumble of sausage almost on each slice. no tomato sauce, they use orange cheddar cheese and its very greasy. in other words, pizza sucks. wine list is very small and the pours are light in small glasses. asked about advertisement that says \""since 1977\"" turns out thats when the owner or creator was born. Not going back. the only saving grace was the hispanic female bartender. Shes worth a look."
0,"If you like Disneyland and waiting hours to ride rides, you will love this s*!t show of an office. My son has seen Dr Burford, Ky, Greenspon, Blank over the past 4 months Plan on being there all day. They moved to an even smaller location this week which is nicer than their \""prison\"" looking old location. However the prison setting is rather appropriate since their staff looks like a bunch of degenerates on a work release program. Do yourself and child better like I did today and fire these losers."
0,no no no no no
1,"True BBQ is BBQ that doesn't need sauce to make it taste good.  This place does an excellent job at doing just that.  The meat comes in its purest form - straight off the bbq or smoker.  You put your own sauce on.  \nWe had the pulled pork, chicken, ribs, and brisket.  We all agreed - it was yummy. The pork was my favorite but since I don't eat brisket, I was down to 3 choices.  The chicken was good - not as good as I've had but it was juicy so can't beat that.  The ribs were really good - tender with the perfect bbq grill taste.  For sides we had, the cornbread and mac salad.  Nothing out of the ordinary but I'd get both again.  Next time I'm trying the sausage and mac n cheese.  \nIt comes with rolls but that's just fillers.\n\nOne tip, this place is SOOOO Hard to find esp, at night.  We all missed it (3 dif. cars) and kept thinking we had the wrong address.    It is in a business park area across the street from the airport.  Look for the Honeywell building's red sign across and turn into the driveway."
0,"This review is based on the food, not the service. We ordered the house cabernet, which tasted like water. The salad was watery and soggy. The food might as well have been frozen dinners from Walmart. Overall, way overpriced for the quality of the food. Avoid this place if you're looking for a meal fit for humans."
1,YAAAS my new fave place!!! always has current songs and awesome stuff and discounts going on!!! the staff are friendly antonio is my fave yaaas bae i get so turnt here i am turnt as i write not alcohol turnt tho bc im underage so i come here all the time. this is my fave place in vegas!!! SLAY ME!!!
1,"First time visiting Tempe, and first time visiting WOB. After bouncing through a couple other bars on Mill Avenue, I landed at WOB. I must say, the staff and atmosphere made me feel much more comfortable than my earlier journeys that evening. I wouldn't call myself a beer enthusiast, but after our server brought us a flight of various samples, I was hooked! The atmosphere was GREAT, live music and a friendly crowd. I didn't realize the endless possibilities, and at first I was a bit overwhelmed. However, our server (who was extremely knowledgable on beer) pointed us in the right direction!  Highly recommend this place if your looking to have some fun on a night out,"
1,"This is a pretty good TJ Maxx; the clothes and bags are a little behind on trend, but that's normal..for the bags at least. There is major good news though, there are complete steals in the accessories section. There are really cute boho bags and backpacks, cute sunglasses and beautiful scarves. \n\nI love bargains, and I love this store. I really liked that it was organized and uncluttered, unusual for me because I live in a very populated city. This store was worth visiting and there wasn't a super long line :)"
0,The food did not taste great and my husbands order came out on the cold side. :/ We will not be going back as we were not impressed.
0,"Our Biaggi's experience was absolutely terrible.  From the service to the food we were incredibly disappointed.  We were served our appetizers about 5 minutes before we received our drinks.  The tomato soup was extremely acidic.  Our entrees were then brought out before our appetizers were even cleared away, and we had to hold our own appetizer plates for the server to \""switch plates with him.\""  The entrees were terrible and for the quality were certainly overpriced.  The eggplant parmigiana was clearly cooked several hours, if not a day before.  It was not at all crispy.  The rigatoni bolanese was supposed to have  tomato cream sauce, but there was no sauce to be seen.  Our server then came over, while I still had a piece of bread in my hand and was eating my food, and had almost a full glass of wine left and said, \""do you guys want a couple boxes?\""  We said yes, thinking that he would bring us two boxes, but at that point he took our plates away (while I was obviously still eating).  I am fine with taking the plates away to box them up, but that should be stated clearer because I would have said, \""No, I'm still eating.\""  The server then asked us if we would also like for him to box up our extra bread.  We said yes.  When we got home and opened our leftovers the next day, we found that he had not packed the bread.  We will not be returning to Biaggi's.  If I could give this place zero stars, I would."
1,"Had dinner last night...got here about 4:30ish, which was perfect timing because by the time we left the line was out the door and towards the parking lot.  \n\nFirst time visitors and we read the comments posted on Yelp so had a bit of an expectation going in.  You stand in line, check out the menu, grap bottled drinks, get your salad sides and desserts out of the cooler and then up to register to order.  We were offered a tasting of lean brisket and turkey...which were great.  My partner had decided on the brisket in line and quickly changed to the turkey.  It was fabulous!  I had the baby back ribs.  They were meaty and yummy.  Yes...no sauce, which is exactly how we like them because then you control the amount of sauce you want on them!  We also had the cole slaw (it needs more dressing, guys...a bit dry), the 3 bean salad (a bit sweeter but we both really liked it) and we had to try the smoked baked potatoe (butter, sour cream, and cheese)...dang it was big (like a small football) and yummy.  You can definitely taste the smoke on the skin.  \n\nYou sit at community tables, which was fine by us!  We love to meet and chat with new people...we sat out on the porch, which was great! \n\nThe condiment bar was clean and nicely stocked.  Previous reviewers mention that you eat on paper, use plastic, etc....we think that's what brings the uniqueness to Rudy's.  We had no issue!\n\nWe both had ice tea; my partner loved the sweet tea!  I had regular, which was good.  There are two bbq sauces to use...I'm a whimp so I found the whimpy sauce good, a bit peppery, but I liked it.  Certainly not the best I've ever had but then everyone has their favorite sauce!  My partner tried the hotter one and ended up using the whimpy one as well.\n\nWe had the banana pudding for dessert...my partner loved it and I thought it was ok...not a big fan of soggy nilla wafers!\n\nService was attentive, the place is clean, and we love the big handwashing sink to clean up after eating!  All in all...a great experience and yes! We'll be back to try the \""famous\"" breakfast tacos\""!!!"
1,"I used to work at Sweet Tammy's and eat several of their baked goods per day. Some of my favorites:\n\n* lemon bars\n* CHALLAH....seriously, it's perfection. And after a few days it makes awesome French toast\n* snickerdoodles\n* coconut macaroons\n\nThey also do a beautiful job on specialty cakes + the bakery itself is beautiful inside. Check it out!"
1,"I have to stop by this place each time I'm staying at the MGM because the corned beef sandwich is just delish! The corned beef is soft and moist. I like to add cheese and coleslaw to my sandwich. Although the coleslaw lacks a lot of flavor and could definitely be better, the quality of the corned beef makes up for it.  It conveniently open late so you can come here after a long night of gambling, partying or what have you. The service is super fast! Within minutes, your order is ready for pick up. The downside is there are not many chairs and tables so sometimes you may end up sitting in those cubicles in front of the big sports televisions."
1,"My trip to the Nordstrom Cafe was like everyone else's\nI did not know what to expect\nWalking in, I thought it was a restaurant where you get seated but figure out the stand in line, cafeteria style type which did not bug me at all\nI found it kinda cool actually\nWalking down the line, there were soooo many different food options and each one looked amazingly good\nKudos for the displays; the let people see what the dish looks like and how big the portions are\nI opted for the cranberry turkey sandwich and a soda, as well as a Snickerdoodle cookie\nAfter paying, you then get seated by a server and your food gets delivered to you\nOur server, Salvadore, was tremendous\nThe service from him was impeccable\nHe was super nice\n\nMy cranberry turkey sandwich was really, really good\n(I am not exaggerating)\nIt also came with some plain potato chips which were great\nMy Dr Pepper was always filled \nand my cookie was heavenly\n\nThis cafe really blew my mind, expecially because it's located in the Nordstrom, in the mall\nI will for sure return to the Nordstrom cafe and I am anxious to try the tomato soup"
0,"Extremely over-rated, not at all worth the hype or the price.\nWould not recommend this place to anyone - unless you are truly desperate to waste your money."
1,"This place is flat out amazing.\n\nEvery Item on the menu is great. I love the Spicy Korean chicken the most though. My other favorites would have to be the Fried chicken, chicken katsu, hamburger katsu, and the Kalua pig.\n\nBest Hawaiin food in town."
1,"Excellent service and wings were fantastic.  Love the sour cream fries!  A little noisy, but it is snowbird season."
0,"The hubby and I were out running errands and time was flying buy, we were starving, and I have been on a constant craving for Italian subs (thanks Jersey Mikes!) so I said lets go to streets, we were in that shopping center anyway... I remembered about six years ago, a friend who worked there hooked me up with an Italian sub, and I remembered it being good. I also remembered having pizza from some other Streets location at some point and it was fresh and good also... I didn't feel very skeptical. We were sat but it seemed like we were forgotten for a while, it took like ten minutes before our waitress came (there were only two or three other tables sat, and at least four servers there). I ordered the sub, hubby ordered medium wings. They brought the complementary bread and I realized it was about to be a sucky meal. The bread was old, the marinara was nasty. I got my Caesar about another ten minutes latter, it was also nasty, the dressing was like Kraft or something bottled and low quality, there was the most powerful BO smelling red onion slice on top. The wings and sandwich didn't take as long... The wings were like precooked Tyson frozen wings with some kind of weird glaze, flavored like buffalo sauce. It didn't even look like real wings. The sandwich was soooooooooooooo gross. The bread was gross, the dressing was flavorless... I hate spending money (yeah it wasn't that much, only a $20 lunch for two, but still...) on food that is nasty. Even the water was nasty. It makes me so mad! Only good thing, our waitress was nice.  We should have went to Greek Corner, where I know the food is GOOD!  Streets needs to make their food fresh to start improving..."
0,"This place is a rip off. I adopted a dog last year who was 12 years old. I did not have his records nor knew of his condition. I took the dog for a check up and exam. Banfield pet Hospital staff talked me into buying their health plan for over $45 a month. Several months later my poor Felfel died due to a liver disease.I called them to cancel the plan since my dog had already died, but found out I had to continue paying into this plan for another four months.\nThis place only cares about taking your money. They are outrageously expensive for everything including shots and doctor visits. After my experience here i checked the prices at more than 22 other pet, and found 20 of them cheaper than Banfield."
0,I had a ribeye - it was tough - wouldn't go back
1,Amazing sandwiches all for only $5.99! 24 hr restaurant! Really good deal especially since it's inside Planet Hollywood on the strip. \n\nThe bread they use is really soft. Loved it. I got the caprese and everything was fresh and delicious. Definetly the place to go to for late night snack or if you want a good sandwich for cheap.
1,Hubs and I ate here alot when we first moved to vegas since it was just down the road from our hotel. We never got tired of it. Food was actually pretty good. Staff are always nice so thats a plus.
0,"$24 for a burger and beer.  \n\nAn airport is not the sort of place where one searches out fine dining.  In fact, it the sort of place where hungry travelers seek out average dining at stratospheric prices.  Such is the case at Burke in the Box at McCarran Int'l Airport in Las Vegas.\n\nThe good:\n\n1)  The only place I could find on concourse D near my gate (53) which accommodated sit-down dining.\n2)  Wide selection of hot dogs, burgers and sandwiches.  I ordered a cheese burger with blue cheese, raw onions, lettuce and tomato.   The burger came with a generous helping of (what appeared to be) re-heated French fries with truffle oil.  I also had a 20oz Stella.\n3)  Good selection of adult beverages\n4)  Modest selection of dessert\n\nThe bad.\n1)  OH MY GAWD: The bill.  $24 for a burger and a beer!!\n2)  Understaffed.  The gentleman in the table next to me got up leaving his sandwich on the table to go the bar and order another drink.  While he was away the waitress cleared away his half-eaten sandwich.\n3)  Pretense at fine dining.  The place is self serving trying to portray itself as haute burger-land: something which it is not.\n4)  Televisions hanging on the wall with the volume up very high. \n5)  The waitress added bacon to my burger - which I didn't ask for and charged me $1.99 extra.\n\nOverall:  I wish more airports were like Dulles Airport in Washington where the prices in there are pretty close to those you'd pay outside of the airport.  The food was decent but it was not fine dining: no way.\n\nWere the burger, fries and beer had come in at $15 I'd be singing the praises of this high-rent burger joint.  At $24 - not so much.\n\nIn Vegas one has the opportunity to gamble at almost every turn.  Rest assured that if you venture into this establishment that you'll come up with snake eyes."
1,$3.95 NY steak and eggs with hash browns! from 12am - 6am only\nIt was a good steak for the price... sooo cheap! \nThe mozarella sticks are kinda pricey and the red clam chowder was sour.\n\nTHIS PLACE IS WORTH A TRY FOR THE $3.95 STEAK! \nDEFINITELY WILL GO BACK TO TAKE MY PARENTS.
0,We bought a deal from RJ Deals for the Halloween Spooktacular Hayride.\nDo Not waste your time or your money!\nI wish I would have checked this site before I purchased anything from these unorganized Hoosiers
0,"I LOVE the perfect scoop on Tropicana and Fort Apache- but this one... Not so much. We bought the groupon a couple of months ago and thought we would have no problem using it, since we grocery shop at Sprouts which isn't far from here. Boy was I wrong. We have only been here once when it was actually open. The hours posted mean nothing. They supposedly open at noon each day, but I waited 15 minutes last week after grocery shopping and no one was there to open the store or answer the phone. Today we went at 1pm, an hour after they were supposed to be open, and no one is here again. How do you tell your two year old you've promised ice cream that she isn't getting it again? You take her somewhere else. I hate that I bought a groupon for this location and am stuck with it. What a waste of money. I will stick with the other locations from now on and not waste my time trying to come back here."
1,"Great......East Coast.....wait for it......SUB EXPLOSION!!\n\nTonight I've been won over by Brooklyn Billy's excellent subs.  I walked in and felt like I was back in Chicago.  The white floors and counter tops match the white walls, which you can see peering out behind an eclectic mix of posters (Jimi Hendrix, The Big Lebowski, etc...)  A few small tables are available, but the majority of the sub shop is made up of the exposed kitchen.  This is a very reassuring thing; good quality ingredients should be showcased as they're being built into a masterpiece.\n\nBilly, yes Brooklyn Billy owns the shop and makes the sandwiches.  He was really friendly and welcoming, as I asked him what he likes.  He told me the roast beef is what Brooklyn Billy's will be known for.  Unfortunately, I couldn't go that route this evening.  Here is what I picked up:\n\nThe Big Lebowski's Favorite - Turkey, swiss, cole slaw, thousand island dressing, and lettuce all on a PERFECTLY fresh sub.  Since it was named after one of my favorite movie's, I had no choice but to order it.  I have to say, \""The dude abides, man.\""  The bread was so incredibly crisp, it rivaled the crunch of the chopped lettuce with each bite.  The coleslaw wasn't too heavy, and the swiss really complimented the thousand island.  \n\nAlbacore Tuna Sub - Flavorful without being drowned in mayonnaise, this tuna was perfectly supported by that wonderful bread.  I had it with provolone, lettuce, and yellow mustard.  This sub was balanced and tasty.  I know tuna salad isn't health food, but I didn't feel weighed down after eating it like I might at some other sandwich shops.\n\n**Both sandwiches were huge by the way, and about $7.75 each, Yum.\n\n\nBottom Line:  This East Coast-style sub shop packs serious flavor in it's high quality subs, made from a high quality guy."
1,"The have amazing food, vegeterian or vegans dream. Their mock chicken wings are delish! Definately will be there as much as possible."
1,"Amazing! Incredible treehouse setting, stupendous service and great food. Las Vegas has a new jewel high atop the rather dull Crystals shopping center at the dreary City Center. I can't tell you how wonderful the entire experience dining at Mastro's is--it's magical. Go, enjoy and bring your camera and appetite."
0,"Spent 15 minutes arguing with the woman who did my intake paperwork about whether insurance for domestic partners \""is legal\"" in the state of Arizona.  She came just short of accusing me of insurance fraud.  I finally had to insist she call the insurance provider and confirm my coverage.  What a narrow-minded, unprofessional office."
0,Came here wit high expectations non of which were meant...  This is one of the spots where the hype killed it. Food was blah and that was not a typo.  No wow factor here..  Flavorless and bland for most of the steam buns which the ratio of protein to veggies way off.  And the all famous duck leg....  This was the worse part of our meal..  Picture a cold tough and unseasoned duck leg smothered with sweet baby rays BBQ sauce..  Other than that the tacky Yusho t-shirts are also something to giggle at..  It isn't Easter anymore fellas.. Very disappointing...
1,"Sure, the first time I came here was with a Groupon in hand, but I came back 7 days later ready to pay the full fare.  I love the ambiance of the dining area, and the food is great.  Looks like they've worked out any kinks with their service, as ours was impeccable on both visits.\n\nI really enjoyed the lunchtime Chicken Katsu Bento Box, the Yellowtail Jalapeno specialty roll, and the Tempura Ice Cream.  Even my 15 month old granddaughter ate everything I sent her way.  The Sushi Room has quality and taste that span generations."
0,"OMG! The previous yelper echoed my sentiments about this place precisely.  I don't know how this place stays in business.  Hydrotherapy is already an uneasy process but this owner's grim attitude makes it even more uncomfortable.  I can overlook a bad attitude here and there because everyone is allowed to have at least one bad day but this one just makes you feel bad for even coming in.  When you walk in, there's no real greeting and even though she's by the front desk, she doesn't address you for a minute.  This makes for an awkward situation. I felt like I had walked into the wrong place at first.  \n\nAnyway, I ended up going there because it was a LivingSocial coupon deal and I had wanted to try the  process.  After one session I reluctantly made a second one, and I showed up for the second one only to pick up the comfort items I purchased from the first visit. I didn't want to give this woman my money. I walked away promising myself that the next time I see a too-good-to-pass-up deal on LivingSocial or Groupon, stop and get Yelp before purchase.\n\nIt has become apparent now that some businesses can only lure new customers from using online coupon deals because they can't keep people coming back for more. \n\nMy advice to this owner is that the whole cleansing method is already an awkward situation, why not go out your way to make the client feel good about being there.\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\nPS: If you read the owner's response, keep in mind that my complaint is not about my appointment time.  I still showed up in enough time to have kept it or make a new one. It's about the ATTITUDE (edited on 7/28/12)."
1,"I skipped the gym so I can eat some deep-fried chicken and since I was in the area, I decided to give Strip N Dip a try. I never went here when it was still BFG so I will not be one of those people who would complain about the dang mural of chickens on the wall. \""This place would've been 5 stars if they hadn't painted over the mural\""...seriously? Did that mural make your food taste better?\n\nI was impressed by the super friendly service. I was surprised a chicken place had Thai tea so of course, I got that since I love Thai tea and it was pretty good. Since it was my first time, I wanted to try as many items as I can.  I went with the 6-pc combo with 1 side, garlic bread and 3 dips and added another side.\n\nChicken:\nYou choose from baked (with rotisserie seasoning), fried (breaded in panko) or grilled (marinated in Asian honey glaze). I got the panko-breaded fried chicken strips. It was light and not greasy. The chicken was cooked perfectly but still juicy. 4/5\n\nSide Dishes:\nThey have baked mac n cheese, French fries and grilled veggies.  I went with the mac n cheese and fries. The mac n cheese was delish with the melted mozzarella on top. The fries are crispy but you have to dip them in sauce to make them tasty - eating them sans sauce is pretty blah. 4/5\n\nSauces:\nYour options are BBQ, buffalo, cheese, wasabi cream, honey mustard, ranch, sweet chili, strip sauce and teriyaki. I tried the wasabi cream, strip sauce and ranch. Ranch was a stupid choice since you can get ranch anywhere but that was my back-up plan in case I didn't like the other sauces. It was ranch. The strip sauce was similar to Cane's dipping sauce so I liked it. I didn't like the wasabi cream. You can taste wasabi the first few seconds and then sweetness takes over. I'm not going to get that again. I have about 4 sauces that I'm willing to try next time I go. But for having lots of options for sauces... 4/5"
1,"An updated Hotel around the Capital, Hoooray!! \n\nWe stayed here for a long weekend and had a great experience. We brought our 1 year old with for the journey and found all the accommodations to be really nice. Rooms are very spacious and amenities are upper end, and especially for Madison hotels near the capital. Parking is ample, easy and affordable. \n\nHidden perk, its only a 3 to 5 minute walk from the Old Fashioned and Teddy Wedgers!"
1,Great place to bring your kids. The Doctors and staff here are amazing!!
1,"What a great spot for a quick, filling and inexpensive lunch! Been here several times for lunch breaks with the Mrs. and we've always been able to get in and out of here in a timely manner and happily full.  \n\nThey have a variety of options including salads, gyro platters, or a simple gyro with fries. The food is made fresh to order and you can even sit and watch it being made through a glass divider. I like being able to see exactly how my food is handled and they whip through orders with a sense of urgency and understanding that people may want to get back to work.  \n\nThere are usually a fair number of people grabbing to-go, so this seems like a good option for those who don't have time to sit and eat, but want a good hot, meal at their desk instead of the standard bagged sandwich. \n\nI've no doubt we'll be back."
0,"I go for the garden area, so that means I enter and exit the garden area. \nNow what I don't understand is their garden gates don't open until 8 a m, regardless of the season.   In the Spring and Summer months the seasonal  annuals and perennials out front are frequently dry, wilted or dying.  Isn't there some sort of job requirement like the most basic garden experience required?  Dried up, over watered plants, plants that have been grown in a greenhouse or a climate unlike ours are put in direct sun and fried to a crisp.  And these people are supposed to be a source of information when I have questions about a plant or planting something?!\n\nCan you tell me why the overhead watering system is turned on when entry gates are opened.  Especially when the gates don't open until 8?\n\nThat folks is how most Home Depot garden centers seem to operate."
0,"Ordered the pizza/wing special. Pizza was OK but the sauce lacked flavor and the crust was not as crispy as I like it. \n\nThe wings looked great, but the buffalo sauce was watered down and not very spicy.   \n\nService was below average but not terrible."
0,"$171 CASH ONLY for a five mile tow. Need i say more? Reason for the CASH only, nobody would allow this purchase to go through."
0,"Good stuff in here but expensive. Go up State Street and find t shirts, hats, etc on sale."
1,Excellent steak! Fresh sides. Very nice staff. It's clean and delicious! It's really a ranch house and we love that about it. You would think that there's cattle out back...that's how fresh the meat was. Yep...we will certainly be back!
1,"Wouldn't have thought to go in here for sushi, but on the recommendation of several friends we tried it, and the food is fantastic.  Also, I personally find the small and slightly unfinished dining area welcoming, and for a Sushi place, very unique."
0,This place might be nice in the warmer weather but the restaurant was freezing and we had our coats on the whole meal. They also left the door open a crack to get the steam out from the kitchen. The service was slow the server was unpleasant and she didn't get us out on time for our show (which we mentioned several times including when we made our reservation). The food wasn't bad but a little overpriced.
0,"Mexican diner (note: not dinner, diner) in SouthPark. Mediocre. Staff - all of them - have no basic hospitality skills. Take it to Park Rd shopping center."
1,Starting off with a 5 we'got adeal on tickets after seeing show totally would have been happy with paying full price great show funny energetic !!! Great music and production
1,"Wife and I had dinner there and loved it. She had the veggie burger with salted potatoes. I had jackfruit(texture and body of oyster mushrooms) tacos, the best kale ever, and rosemary beans. Well prepared and simply presented. Comfortable like only East Charlotte can be, think Lupie's Cafe or Crazy Fish. Forget an vegan hang ups. We will eat here often. This is just good food."
0,"Today, two clerks at the Eastern store insisted that \""Extra Dry\"" champagne was drier than \""Brut.\""   WRONG!!!"
0,"There's several places I could start this review. Perhaps its with Favorit's dimly-lit air of cool sophistication replete with its sumptuous leather-boothed seating and artisan interior. Maybe its the darkly accentuated wooden bar framed by shelf-upon-shelf of mainland europe's most stylish and luxurious designer lagers. Lagers that are both ready and exorbitantly priced to extract the unwary from they're hard-earnt cash in exchange for Favorit's false-promise of a cafe society usually only reserved for our more enlightened continental cousins. Special mention must also be made for the surly petulance and latino arrogance delivered with a studied sneer by the slick-haired Manager. An aloofness that leads the unsuspecting punter to wonder if this is born from the knowledge of the unparalleled excellence over which he  presides. If anything, and you'll find this later, it merely serves to mask the thinly-veiled disregard for the very people that keep him in business - YOU - the customer. You see, if you're promised quality, as the prices Favorit charge suggest that you are, and you don't get the service you think you're paying for, you're going to feel just a little bit pissed off...that's just fact.\n\nSo, the place I'd really like to begin is with the food. And whilst we weren't expecting anything so lavish as say, a Consomm\u00e9 of Pheasant with truffle wonton, fine herbs and enoki mushrooms, or Seared Jumbo Scallops on a fluffed bed of potato with caviar and smoked tomato mousse. What we really weren't expecting however, was two plates of half-inch thick bright orange 'slick' masquerading as melted cheese, masquerading as lasagne. Imagine our slack-jawed astonishment when, after a cursory prod with the fork revealed nothing more than a limp patchwork of anaemic pasta bereft as it was of all other key lasagne ingredients. 'Cheesy Pasta' would have been a more apt description - a pasta which, for all the world, when coupled with the cooled orange day-glow swamp of cheese somehow contrived to look less like food, and more like the badly healed remains of a burn victim's face. Infact, stick it on a balloon with painted passata features and a more passable Simon Weston* effigy would be harder to find. I'd urge you all to try it if it didn't mean going there.\n\nSkirting past the accompanying handful of potato wedges (cold), and the side salad (the best thing on the plate). It strikes me that, in this day and age, in towns and cities throughout the UK where the high streets are awash with standardised, homogenised chains - you look to your independents to offer something a little bit different. A level of quality and excellence, coupled with an assured personal touch that you just can't find, and much less expect at your local Wetherspoons or Pizzahut. And above all, you don't mind paying the price for it.\n\nSo its with these values foremost in mind that you turn to places like Favorit because you're led to believe that they're a little unique and a little bit special. And whilst you'll turn a blind eye to a mixed up drinks order, or a prolonged wait - its much less the case when you're paying through the nose to have your intelligence insulted by the service of substandard food. Food for which far meatier examples exist at the bottom of your local supermarket's freezer section, ultimately means, at least where these over-preened mafio-so-piss-poor goons are concerned - you'd be far more likely to find a severed horses head on your pillow than satisfaction from Favorit's food. \n\nA final thought, if you're reading this review and you've never been. Rest-assured, I have, so you don't have to.\n\n*Sorry Si, its nowt personal..."
0,"Started the adventure around a year ago. Food and service so bad my husband complained and received a comp. We didn't want to go back there, so we redeemed it at their sister property, Silver Nugget . Tried again @ Opera House 2 wks ago, hubby was reeled in by 16oz t-bone for $5.99. Bad decision. Steak coated in pepper. Returned that and hard as nail potato. Results in another comp, $15 this time. Entire time , mgmt horrified their staff is that horrible. We take my father, probably for amusement value @ this point. Green beans are not seasoned, at all. We ask for them to be sent back, seasoned. Waitress brings back, in same bowl , with pepper liberally shaken on. I know this is a ghetto- fabulous casino, but pepper on everything ? We inform the manager, whom has  a pow wow w kitchen staff . They smugly\n inform us we are no longer welcome. As if...I invite the manager to sample the green beans. She declines , stating she, the 90 lb skinny broad is not picky about her food. It's obvious the food that goes down her gullet passes stringent tests, unlike the employees she hires or the food they serve. Better off  as a snack bar."
0,"So as a regular here I was terribly disappointed in my visit tonight. I placed a to go order and was told 15 min. I didn't get there until 20 min after I called. Upon arrival, I could tell the place was busy. The food is always amazing here but sometimes the service is less than acceptable. Tonight I was shocked. Not only did I stand and wait 10 min until someone acknowledged me, I saw them give my to go order to someone else! The server and bartender seemed uninterested and were rude to me when I made them aware. The daytime staff are amazing most of the time. Tonight...they were off."
1,"This year we popped into the Old Town Tavern on Saturday to have a few brews before taking on the spectacle... and It worked... we were all having a great time by 5pm drinking and listening to \""Boston Joey\"" belt out tunes on the patio - Then we finally entered the festival. This event is all about drinking and people watching and if that's what your expectation is, you WILL enjoy yourself. As for the food - there were several sushi, taco, and dessert outfits to satiate you... oh, and a great Beatles cover band.\n\n*The event was better organized and a little more spread out this year. So kudos to them on the improvements."
1,"Love this place.  They have a little bit of everything.  If you need one nail, you can buy just one nail.  The staff is extremely helpful. They know about plants, seeds and hardware.  Describe your home repair project, and they will tell you what you need to do the job.  They have some items that have been discontinued and can't be found anywhere else."
1,"Nice people that come in here. Very knowledgable bartenders. \n\nIt also appears that a majority of the headlining EDM DJs get signed into exclusivity contracts strictly for this club, such as Morgan Page, Deadmau5, and Nicky Romero. It seems to be a contract war between Marquee at the Cosmopolitan and XS every half a year, so the talents continuously change because of that. \n\nAnd, you get to enjoy some of them playing on locals nights on Sundays and Mondays, all for free! And these are not some dumbasses that mash together prerecorded tracks of real talent at a second-rate club or hookah lounge, these are the REAL talent themselves!\n\nIt is like... climbing over the gates of Electric Daisy Carnival for an hour, and then immediately hopping back over before security finds you. You get your celebrity DJ experience regardless of what day you went, all for a better price than buying stupid $500 3-day General Admission tickets. \n\nBut at least at local nights, there are not many GOOD looking people that come in. Let me make it clear, they are NICE people, they just NOT NICE LOOKING people. A majority of the women who showed up are either fat or old. They are real nice in a conversation, but I was always looking for a window of opportunity to get away from them. \n\nI bumped and spilled my drink several times in 2 hours, I got a lot of offers to get one bought for me. Guys that come here are real gentlemen, and the women are um... \""nice\"".\n\nAnd everybody is either white or asian."
0,"If ya wanna win me ova, then ya gotta gimme more meat in my deli sandwich, especially when ya chargin' the prices ya chargin'!  There should be double da meat in there!  The sandwiches at Rinaldi's are nothin' dat I can't make at home, as long as I keep shoppin' at Fry's.  Nothin' special 'bout the bread, which is arguably the most important part of the deli sandwich/hoagie.  The only reason I'm givin' this place two stars instead of one is because they use Boar's Head.  Great meat, use more of it!"
1,"We stopped in for a quick lunch and it was my 10th visit (approximately) and my wife's 50th (near her workplace, so lunches there).  \n\nNello's expanded their menu over the past year or so, and I was quite happy to find a decent sandwich on wheat bread that I ordered as a half with a side salad.  Nice sized salad, great sandwich (Sorry, can't remember the name but it was fairly lean meat and onions)\n\nThe service was excellent from a 20 yr old young man who was attentive without hovering. \n\n Nice selection of wines, beer and ciders with many on tap.\n\nNello's also serves brunch on weekends, which was news to both of us.  Their short brunch menu had a few nice dishes and they offer Mimosas, Hyacinths and other brunch style drinks."
0,"Very average Thai meal - if i lived down across the street i'm not sure if i would frequent this place.   I feel you can pay cheaper, go to an Archi's and get better.\n\nWe ordered a Thai BBQ chicken which was was dry and lacked flavor.  I think if i google'd a Thai BBQ chicken recipe and attempted to cook it myself, it would turn out better.....and i don't cook......at all\n\nThe rest of the dishes were decent.   It was edible.  But with so many other options in this area, you're better off somewhere else or if you're really craving Thai you can do much better."
0,"I went here recently for dinner with my family and about 5 minutes after our appetizer arrived so did our dinner so we didn't even get a chance to enjoy our first round. The steak I ordered was way undercooked when I asked for medium well, It was so red it was dripping.  Our server was very nice about the situation but it was the manager that had an attitude.  The manager explained to me that medium well takes a long time to cook and that's why my new steak was taking so long.. Of course I know that it takes a long time. That's why I was surprised it came out so quick. Terrible service from the manager and I won't be returning."
0,"I did not particularly care for this library. The book selection is not great especially if you are looking for reference books. The employees are grumpy and at times rude. Every thing is sectioned off: teens are suppose to occupy one area, adults another, and children another. Children are not allowed to sit in the teen area of the library. I took a fourth grader with me and he wanted to sit in the teen section and an employee immediately made up move. He did not like the children's section because he said it was babyish."
0,"Food is good but service is terrible!!!  We are regulars here and service has never been good but this time it took the cake.  We waited 1/2 hour just to order.  After 1.5 hours, three people in our party finally got there food.  Then the rest of our good trickled in.  Worst part was owner never once even apologized.  In fact she seemed annoyed and put out the entire time.  That will be the last time we patronize their restaurant."
1,"While we were happy to finally have what looked like a decent place in Forest Hills, we were skeptical about whether the new restaurant would compare to alternatives in Shadyside et al.  We were not disappointed.\n\nThe pork osso bucco is amazing, first of all.  It's both delicious (one of those meat dishes that's been cooked on the bone in some kind of savory sauce for a long time) and impressively presented.  We also had the calamari for an appetizer, which was not overcooked, too salty, or too greasy as fried calamari often can be.  I also thought the basil dipping sauce was something new.  The tiramisu looked amazing, but we were too full to try it - next time!  It was nice to see that they have a gluten free menu for friends with dietary concerns, or for the days when we're trying to be healthy :)\n\nThe beer and wine selection are both great with a wide range of prices and international selection.  \n\nThe atmosphere is pleasant.  It's festive but not too loud, the tables aren't too close together, they have a number of TVs with sports around, and you can see the wine cave.  There's also a white grand piano near the entrance, haha.  We sat inside, but the patio looks nice.  We walked, but it looks like parking is easy enough.\n\nThe waitstaff needs further refining, but we expected that given that the place is new.  We could at least see that they were very eager to please and fix any errors."
0,"His cooking was bold, spicy and has a Mexican flare.  What else would expect from a 4th generation Irishman?  I have my doubts too.  Does this this leprechaun know how to throwdown some mexican flavor in the kitchen?  \n\nread more here: http://www.bougiefood.com/?p=323"
1,"The Music was awesome however the pool is really to small for a casino of this size. I just feel they should close down the pool for the winter and build an appropriate size pool. As I stated with the exception of the pool everything else was great, especially the music. This was my 1st wine tasting event and I wish I had found about them earlier because I will be attending many more of them as they pop up."
1,I took my cat pretty boy to them to get a hair cut. My cat has never been groomer before and he is eight years old. I didn't know how he would respond so I took him anyways to give it a try. The people here were affectionate and made my cat feel comfortable. They groomed him and he turned out looking adorable! He loved it also. My cat seemed happier! Thank you guys so much for being so professional. I am going to take both my animals here when ever I need grooming done!
0,"Sadly I have to write my first bad review.\n\nThis place should be ashamed to have the word barbecue in there name.\nFirst off i'll start by telling you I am from Kansas City, I know about BBQ,\nI took my husband and kids here for dinner, we have been dying for some Burnt Ends, the decor is nice the server was friendly and very nice as well but the food is horrid.\n\nHubby ordered the Burnt Ends \""naked\"" no sauce they should be DRY as he has food allergies and has to be careful with spices and sauces.\n\nI ordered the crawfish app and the 4 meat combo to split with the kids.\n\nour order came out and hubby's was covered in sauce, so we let the server know, they went back to remake it.\n\nThe meat combo was missing the chicken and we had to ask for it, once it we got the chicken is was very dry and over cooked, as was the shredded pork.\n\nthe crawfish was was over salted and dry\n\nHusbands burnt ends finely came out again with sauce so we complained then we were told by the manager \""oh we baste them 3 times in the cooking so there is no way to get them dry, sorry your server didn't know\"" WTF BBQ is about the meat and the cooking it is NOT about drowning it in sauce what are you trying to hide about your food? The spices in the sauce are so over powering you can't even taste the meat or anything else after that!  My husband ended up at home with a frozen pizza after what should have been a nice family dinner out!\n\nThe mac and cheese? ya its Kraft I can make a whole box at home for less than there $2.25 side dish! \n\nAll in all it was a bad expensive experience, the best part of the whole dinner was the sweet apple blossom iced tea, now thats really sad\n\ndon't waste your money on this place drive over to North Las Vegas and find H&H BBQ"
0,"Salad bar is good and that's about it.  The meatloaf definitely needed the scant cup of gravy that it came with.  The green beans were without doubt, from a can.  The Irish Potatoes (LMAO) are the little round ones that I like, that also come in a can, but I never saw them served in a restaurant before.  The decor is old and homey, this place could use a restaurant makeover, utilizing part of the current decor,  modernizing it,  EXPANDING THE BAR and DRAFT BEER LIST, and using FRESH INGREDIENTS.   Great central location.  They should take advantage of it and polish up a bit."
0,"My friend and I decided to check out this spa for the first time for Spa week. We both booked the 55 minute massage deals. Very mediocre massage lasted only 35 minutes for both of us. My massage therapist had long nails that scratched my skin. I've never had a therapist have long nails, it was not pleasant. The facilities are outdated, dirty and could use a complete renovation. The ceilings are so low, you feel like you are in a cave. The locker room was very small and with the number of guests, we were all crowded and getting in each other's way trying to get into our lockers - which are digital but kept locking us out. Myself & several guests had to get an attendant to unlock them. The steam room was moldy & had clumps of hair on the floor. Gross! The grout on the tiled floors were also dirty. The mirrors in the locker rooms need to be replaced, they were starting to turn black and were spotted. Also, the gratuity is automatically charged, which is ridiculous since I was shorted by 20 minutes on my massage.  With the reputation the Biltmore Resort has, I am shocked at how awful the Spa is. I will not be back!"
1,"Wish I could say better about the food-3 out of 4 dishes were not good. My burrito was huge and tasty. The drinks and service was excellent. \""Carlita\"" the cashier/waitress/bartender was awesome! She made the place. $4 for caddy margarita & $3 draft Modelos tasty & a price can't be beat. \nStick with the drinks and burritos. Stay away from the sopapillas and the posole. Also, keep in mind this is \""new\"" Mexican, despite the numerous Mexican items. Go for the food, stay for the service, come back for the drinks. Enjoy!"
0,"A major disappointment, overall.\n\nI'm from the north, and we love diners, so I was excited.  Unfortunately, I was sorely disappointed. \n\nThe first 2 times I went there, I had appetizers because I wasn't very hungry.  They were both pretty bad.  Still, when invited to join some friends for lunch, I accepted, hoping that maybe I'd find something yummy if I order an actual meal.  Again, I was disappointed.  I ordered a chicken gyro.  The chicken was tasteless (except for being overly salty) and very tough.  It was an extremely small portion too.  I'm glad it came with fries, although they were cold and very greasy, even for fries.  We were a party of 9, and no one liked their food at all, except for a 14-year-old, who ordered the chicken parmesean.  Even she admitted she's had better.  One guy at the table ordered a burger, and asked me to try it because he couldn't believe how awful it was.  I must admit, it was without a doubt the absolute worst burger I've ever had, hands down.  The meat was extremely hard and dry.  It was really inedible.  He was hungry, so he ate about 1/2 of it and left the rest.\n\nAlso, for a diner, it's pretty expensive.\n\nI think the place is very attractive and comfortable, strictly from the standpoint of aesthetics.  Unfortunately, I'd rather have great food in a 'hole-in-the-wall' type of diner.  I don't go to a diner for the ambience.  I go for good, old-fashioned diner food.  It is not hard to make good food diner style.  I really hope they can step up in the future.\n\nMaybe their breakfast food is good.  The only way I'd try them again is if I'm in the mood for breakfast.  I'm always looking for a good place for a lazy Saturday morning breakfast."
1,"Nothing portrays a summer in Montreal better than the fabulous array of terrasses that unfold after a long winter of hiding. Tourists and locals come out to play, drink, and mingle over some great beverages and a bite to eat under the sun. Terrasse Nelligan boasts this trendy and classy ambiance atop its boutique hotel establishment. The stunning rooftop provides a beautiful roof-level view of Old Montreal's numerous buildings and landmarks such as the Notre-Dame Basilica, while the other side of the terrasse offers a decent view of the port. For better views of the river and its surroundings, I would suggest a rooftop terrasse such as L'Auberge Vieux-Port on Rue de la Commune. But for the Nelligan, its impressive views of historical architecture and the feeling of being immersed amongst Old Montreal's cultural heritage sets off a unique and memorable experience in itself.\n\nTerrasse Nelligan hosts happy hour every Thursday and constantly updates their delicious cocktail menu. They make a fantastic white sangria with sparkling wine, which I highly recommend and greatly enjoy. If you get hungry, they serve food too, freshly pressed on their outdoor grill, ranging from paninis to quality cuts of meat and fish.\n\nFrom the ambiance, to the drinks, to the food, you will definitely walk off this terrasse already planning your next visit."
1,Wonderfull little place. He serves fresh local food when he can. They had a special one night with a T-Bone for two and it was wonderful. \nGreat place to get fresh pasta to take home and cook.
0,"While shopping around numerous places, The Signature was the only 1 that claimed they were able to house all 8 of us within our budget Reservations told me, they have a Suite that had 2 bedrooms & large living room: room #1 had 2 queen bed & 1 pull out bed, room #2 has 1 king size bed & 1 pull out bed & large living room area between the 2 room It also came with a full kitchen & an extra bathroom in the living room They also told me to go to their website to look at the photo video, which I did & it looked nice It was for $1150 for 3 day & 2 night I called back later on, just to double check what I was told & reservation confirmed it with me that I took down everything correct\n\nAfter discussing with my friends, we came to conclusion that, that was what we wanted Again, I called reservations again & they told me the same thing This time, they even offered me a 10% discount for having AAA. Even better!\n\nSo its finally Friday, we were early, so we left our luggage with the bell hop. He was very nice, helped us right away and store our luggage away We returned back around 3 pm to check in, the process was nice & quick Excited I headed towards the suite, open the door, only to find, that it WASN'T what was on the photos & as described. It only has 2 bedrooms 2 separate living rooms each bedroom had only 1 bed & 1 pull out couch\n\nA bit puzzled, I ran down stairs to ask the front desk for help, I went back to the same person who checked me in And this time, he was a bit rude to me, he said that was what I booked & what I wanted, there isn't anything he can do for me & sent me away\n\nI went back to the hotel room, just a bit upset. I told my friends, they were just all a bit upset as well But as I sat there, just replaying what I was told by reservation, again & again, it didn't make sense to me I decided to call front desk again, demanded for someone to fix matters for me\n\nNow is when it goes super downhill, they pretty much transferred me around, I believe among each other so I would give up But I didn't!! They made me explain my situation again, again & again Non-stop One of them told me that if I was not happy with the room, I can cancel it, but I will be charged the cancellation fee Another told me that they don't offer roll out beds, but they will have to charge me for the extra people I have in my room That I originally ask about, that they said was fine to have 8 people in one suite. This other one told me they can give me $100 food & beverage credit Another told me to just book another room with them, & just that night itself it was going to be $350+\n\nFINALLY! They send me to their Front Desk Manager her name is Valarie, she had me explain my whole situation to her again No surprised there She tells me, she is sorry, & asked what she can do. I ask her what she can do for me. She said if I want, I can just leave, & she will cancel my stay. She will also do me a favor by waiving my cancellation fee. That's the only solution she offered me... Really?!\n\nSeriously, that was the last straw for me. I just lost it, I told her I was going to stay, I don't have time to go looking for another hotel in the middle of the day. I even booked a bungalow at the pool area. I know, at this point I was possibly the worst customer to deal with But giving me the run around doesn't give them the excuse to push me out I am sorry, but they did this to me, they bought the angry me to themselves I don't want to have to break the bad news to my friends by telling them to sleep on the floor or have them pay more to stay in a different room \n\nAlong the line of discussing with her, she told me that my stay was going to be free. That totally caught me off guard, I wasn't expecting that at all, whatsoever. A bit confused I asked again so my stay here will be free? Saying this loud enough that friends could hear me And she said YES.  She told me yes, suddenly I was bit relief. After thanking her, we hung up\n\nI thought to myself wow The Signature is really good at taking care of their customers, sadly it is only when the customer is able to lost it. Then the bf decided to hop onto Yelp & saw that most of their complaints was about customer services & the front desk about how they are NOT helpful at all. I felt a bit uneasy, so I gave them a call again. Asked for Valarie directly, I asked her again about this whole ordeal about my stay being free. And you know what?! She said NO, I didn't say that!! OMFG! Right? RIGHT?! I repeated to her again what we talked about. She didn't say anything to me & automatically tossed in another 10% off She also casually mentioned that she will see if she can get our bungalow with $100 food & beverages comp which didn't happen. I didn't know what to say anymore. I was done fighting\n\nI just settled and folded. The hotel stay was around $758 But I don't know, I didn't leave a happy camper. For sure I will not go back & if anyone ask about where to stay in Vegas I will be sure to let them know where NOT to stay."
0,The manger didnt want to a accept a federal ID we decided to leave and not give or money to this location really unprofessional will make a report with the location license and their liquor license if I could give them a negative points I would probably wont be going here anytime soon until.I.get I legit apologize from the manger and the top ppl of.native new york
0,"Good food, tastes close enough to the real Filipino cooking at home.  The staff lacks warmth and charisma, specially the lady at the cash register who seems to be annoyed that her dinner was interrupted by a paying clientele.  This attitude will certainly not create good will towards repeat customers.   Will not visit the place again even though the fare is fantastic."
1,"My first trip to InsertCoins was a weeknight during happy hour, it was DEAD!  What was cool though was cheap drinks and we basically got to play all of the arcade games (25c-50c plays was a nice surprise) and got our choice of seating at the bar which meant we got to play any Xbox360 or PS3 game we wanted.  We also had an opportunity to check out all of the art on the walls.  It was very chill, but we definitely felt like we didn't get the entire experience so we decided to go back on an evening (yesterday) to get the full effect.\n\nI follow InsertCoins on twitter and when my out of town friends and I (I'm a local) decided that's where we wanted to go, I hopped on twitter to see if they had posted the happenings for the evening.  They hadn't, however, a fellow patron DID post the twitter handle of the VIP host who had hooked her up the night before.  I figured, hell, why not?, and sent a tweet over to miss @LeeMarieLV (Lisa), we tweeted back and forth a couple times, and in minutes I had a table (or rather \""gaming station\"") secured with a $100 drink min (for 4 ppl) which included the station & 2 consoles for the entire evening.  That's a pretty good deal if you ask me, I figured we would have spent that $25/pp anyway.  We arrived at about 9:30 (scored some Sweet on-street parking) and found that it was InsertCoins first Live Band event (nice surprise).  The band was really good (rockabilly style), and the acoustics weren't terrible.  Lisa (VIP Host) was at the door when we arrived, introduced us to our waitress (Gabriella) and walked us right to our gaming station.  Gabriella brought us over the \""menu\"" (it's a book with all of the available game titles) and took our first drink orders.  Within an hour, the place was definitely filling up more (not over crowded or anything, it was a good vibe), and it's amazing how even though you're basically right out on the floor, how private the gaming station feels.  Even with the live music going, we could still chat w/ each other while enjoying our games.  We stayed until a little passed midnight, and while the band was no longer playing, the DJ was and the place was still hopping.\n\nCONS: -\n-  I didn't know you couldn't choose to swap different gaming consoles, not just games, when you have a table/station.  Apparently when you make your reservation, you need to ask for a specific gaming console or get what they give you.  We wound up sitting at a station with (2) PS3's (a little bit of a bummer since we were hoping to play to Super Mario Kart and Paperboy, but this is really my fault for not checking, not theirs)\n-Our Server was the biggest CON and really the only reason I didn't give a full 5 stars.  Her name was Gabriella.  I don't know if she just didn't like us, or if we didn't look like we were good tippers, but my drink sat empty multiple times for a while, she passed our station quite often, but never looked in our direction to see if we needed anything or if our drinks were low, the only time she came over to us without one of us having to go track her down was when she needed our \""menu\"" to give to another station.  It was so bad at one point that my drink had been empty for about 10mins I went to go find her and she was standing there flirting with one of the guys that worked there.  I didn't want to interrupt, but she saw me - looking at her, STANDING at our station, she looked at me multiple times and didn't acknowledge me.  Then when her conversation ended, she just turned and walked away, my fiance had to go flag her down so that we could get our drinks refreshed.  We weren't planning on spending the entire night there, and we had our drink minimum to meet, so I was a little peeved that we had to basically BEG for the drinks we were required to have.  I thought that maybe the auto-grat was the reason she basically ignored us all night, but she was very pleasant and charming and attentive to the group right next to us.  All in all, it's her loss.  My fiance and I are both servers (he is currently, I'm a former server) and because of this, we tend to tip VERY WELL (for instance, the server has to be REALLY bad to get less than 20%, we usually tip 25%-30%), and had she put in ANY effort, she would have gotten much more than her 18% auto-grat from us. (We tip even better when we've been drinking!)\n\nPROS: \nLisa was amazing.  She secured us the table reservation very last minute, was totally personable, and was completely responsive to our concerns about how we were treated by our waitress.  She even provided us with some comps for next time because of our issues w/ our waitress (which while we weren't expecting them, nor did we ask for them, was very nice).\n\nMy final take away - the drinks were tasty, the games were a plenty, the vibe was right - we'll definitely be coming back again and again - this is our type of place.....\n\n....we'll just be making sure Gabriella isn't our waitress, she really put a damper on otherwise great evening."
1,"This is my first time using vape. PSV showed me how to use the products and let me taste majority of the flavor. I bought the voltage tube mod with adjustable volatage, battery, charger, 6ml tank, and the 6 bottle sample set. They also upgraded my cartomizer for free so I dont burn it out. All of this with tax came out to $149. Very great price! They showed me how everything works and are very friendly when doing so. The place is a little far but well worth it. I would say to bring cash if you spend over $50 because you get a free 6ml bottle of your choice. I only tried rip tide so far and it taste amazing. I will be going here from now on for flavors and accessories."
1,"Went to L'Avenue on Sunday morning (Jan. 29th, 2012). We had read reviews about it before going, so we picked up on the \""Don't Go Too Late\"" advice....\n\nWe purposefully went early. Left the house at 8:00am and got to the resto at about 8:50am. No line, No wait, No one was there yet. As expected they did get a lot busier as time passed. We saw them turn a few people away. \n\nOur meals were great. We had no complaints. My husband really enjoyed his dish, as did I. The fruit skewers are a big bonus. Their potatoes are specially seasoned. They eggs were great along with everything else.\n\nI would have *loved* to try a fruit smoothie, but at $6.95 a pop, I decided to skip. \n\nFor those who get upset by the wait: For this restaurant, you either need to EXPECT a line up and don't give 'em flack for having to wait, OR you go super EARLY. The place is very popular & well-known, weekends are the busiest days, and they don't have ample seating space - so it makes sense that when they are busy there are line-ups."
0,"Not pleased with the thai food. \n\nThe dishes weren't nearly spicy enough, and there was nothing special about it the dish either. It was like every other thai place but this one was more expensive.\n I got the pad thai fusion with red sauce.  While the presentation was very impressive, the taste was nothing even coming close."
0,"The results of an informal poll of my dinning companions could best be described as a shrug. The pasta and sandwiches we had for dinner were passible, but I doubt we will be back."
0,"Place is under new management and boy is this new owner about saving every dollar she can. Even the atmosphere has changed - the happy chefs I used to know now look miserable.  When asked why the changes in the menu, at least she was honest about saving money however when I responded with the changes probably cost her a customer and this might be my last visit she told me and my buddy who were in uniform to get out.  Beware of this place!"
0,"I've been to Bluephies many, many times.  What kept me going back was the food - it is pretty damn good.  The prices are CRAZY, though - this is a DINER in MADISON not Aix en Provence. \n\nUnfortunately, the service is TERRIBLE!!!  \n\nDuring one visit, the patrons at the table next to us started changing their baby's diaper on the TABLE - the wait staff was unable to intervene - so my husband and I had to say something.  Who wants to see a baby's ass during dinner? not to speak of air-borne illnesses landing in our food ~ 3 feet away."
1,"Went back, still perfect service and staff, still great food, still huge rooms for a fair price.  Love the walking trails.  Going back again!"
0,"Pluses:  Great looking servers and hostesses, very nice.  Our server Mary gave us great service.  Food and drinks were standard, nothing to write home about.\n\nMinuses: Busy on a Saturday afternoon after the Spring Training game across the street ended.  I was surprised they could seat our party of 7 right away, but they did;  In a back room with pool tables and dart boards and us kind of squeezed in-between.  It didn't appear to be an area they normally put tables.  And soon, a group of biker-looking fellows showed up to play pool and seemed very put out that we were 'in their space'.  It made the whole situation uncomfortable, and even a little dangerous."

0,"I had a contract with O Premium, who apparently was bought out by Sparkletts some years ago.  I have had nothing but problems with this company.  They give you a delivery schedule and you put out all your empties on the stated date.  Only to come home to your empties bottles rolling around the neighborhood because they didn't bother to show up yet AGAIN.  \n\nWe got so annoyed by this repeated problem and began to wonder if it was us getting confused.  We asked them to change the deliveries to our business address so we could actually watch and track their deliveries and accountability.  It soon became very clear that it was not our imagination and that they in fact missed deliveries on a regular basis.  They don't have any problem in their billing department, those folks get the bills out every month, on time, and they sure expect you to pay promptly, but God help you if you need a drink of water.\n\nThey missed my last delivery (although the driver marked off on his little sheet that he came here), and they were supposed to make a special makeup delivery here first thing this morning.  Guess what?  They no showed AGAIN!  I just called to verify I was in fact on the schedule for today, only to be told there was no record of my call or the special delivery.\n\nDO YOURSELF A FAVOR AND DO NOT ORDER ANYTHING FROM THIS COMPANY THEY ARE INCOMPETENT."
1,This place is so amazing that my 5 year old wants to come back.\n\nI could not have asked for anything more. They delivered more than expected to my son. The staff was amazing with him and made him feel so comfortable that he actually sat through an entire cleaning without being upset once. They had him put on sunglasses during the cleaning and he thought that was cool. They hygienist also told him about the sugar bugs living in his mouth and that he has to keep up brushing and flossing so the sugar bugs wont live in his mouth.\n\nThe dentist and the assistants were made to work with children and that made it all very relaxing and enjoyable for him.
0,"I have been to \""E\"" And Jaleo on two separate occasions and never had any issues but On Tuesday the 23rd I was in Jaleo eating dinner with my family, And we ordered a lot of food when the croquettes came out I bit into one and there was a HUGE CHICKEN BONE that stabbed me in the mouth. I let the waitress know and she said \""it happens\"" They called over the manager and she offered to call a medic. She did not however offer to compensate anything on my meal. I told her that we did not want to eat anymore and she said that she would bring me my check for the cocktails that we ordered. I would expect this from some restaurants but not one in the cosmopolitan and surly not one that I am going to drop over $400 on one meal. I understand that this happens as they said to me after I was stabbed in the mouth, but the way the staff handled it was not appropriate. I will not be coming back to Jaleo or to the cosmopolitan."
0,"David David David....Two sides to every coin.  Mr. Copperfield has acquired a lifetime of success doing \""illusions\"" or tricking people into believing one thing while he does another (I'm not terribly fond of magic, but can be entertained).  You can tell he's been doing it wayyyyyyyyyyyyy too long, he just didn't seem into it............at all.  It's as though he was on auto-pilot.  \n\nThere were a few cool tricks, especially when the car appears on the stage (sweet ride btw).  \n\nHowever, I laughed quite heartily through out the show.  He had a few parts that almost caused me to fear bladder problems.  Would I have paid for tickets if I didn't get them comped? Umm, no. \n\nBefore he 'appeared' on stage, there was a tedious \""DAVID COPPERFIELD\"" tribute video, it was cool the first few minutes...but daaaaang dude, ease up, we don't need to see every SINGLE show clip that your name was mentioned in.\n\nIt was ok.  I think he's a handsome older man, but his fake hair was awfully distracting.  Thirty minutes of the show was spent trying to figure out if it was sprayed on or astro-turf."
1,"I checked into a one bedroom suite yesterday and was blown away. The bathroom is super large, as a matter of fact there are two full baths. The decor is excellent. \nThe pool is like a garden oasis. The lifeguard was very attentive and came over and adjusted our umbrella for us. This was so nice.\nThis is a valet only property but they are pretty fast. I think they could improve by making specific lanes for valet, taxis, and shuttles. \nAlso the housekeepers need to tighten up a bit. There was an Advil on our floor when we arrived. Also a travel size bottle of something on the floor under the sink in the bathroom. Hopefully it won't be there when you check in.\nBut beyond that A++ from me.\nBest 19th anniversary ever!\nDon't believe the negative comments, they must be crazy!"
0,"I went to this nail place for the first time today because someone bought me a gift card there. The location was good & the salon looked fair clean (although a bit run down) but the staff was not friendly & did a lazy job. I went for a pedicure &  tech was so annoyed at how short I had cut my toenails. Then when I wanted a bright pink french pedicure, she didn't wait at all to apply the top coat & blurred the pink over the white, not to mention the didn't mention the $5 up charge for the (sloppy) french pedicure. Also, my feet feel scratchier than they did before. I did not enjoy this experience & will not be returning."
0,"Underwhelming in every aspect!  Service was horrible, food was under seasoned, and prices were extremely high for food quality.  I would not recommend and several other tables around us had a similar experience that evening."
1,"Three things make Geisha A Go Go my go to place in Old Town for happy hour... 3 things... and they are -\n\nTeriyaki Ribs (oh my!)\n\nHello Kitty (sake martini/cocktail of oh so yummy strawberry like goodness)\n\nand....\n(drum roll please...)\n\nAll night happy hour on Sundays from 3p til 2am. \n\nWhat kind of happy hour you ask? half off appetizers, of which the Teriyaki Ribs are part of... half of maki/house rolls and half off (insert angels singing in unison here.) half off all drinks in house. yes you heard that right, half off u-call its, specialty drinks, sake bombers, sake infusion drinks... i'm telling you it's heaven for the Sunday lush!\n\nSo, why should you go other than the three things listed above? Because when you have a hankering to end the week with good times or start the week in a drunken daze this my yelpers is the place to go. The atmosphere is great, good music, good vibes, good drinks, music videos to watch, oh and yummy teriyaki ribs to scarf down, oh and good eye candy, girls and boys alike to secretly check out. Oh, and if you have a big group make sure to reserve a table for groups 10 or more coz it's crowded by 5. and when they say the wait time is at least an hour, believe it coz no ones leaving a good happy hour at Geisha! deuces!"
1,I tried Narai when my family was in town; everyone enjoyed their meal. They have a wide variety of Thai food and sushi and a full bar. Our servers were very attentive. \n\nI had the tofu pad thai with medium spice (which is still pretty spicy). It had a nice flavor to it. and enough of a portion to take leftovers home for lunch. My sister really enjoyed her papaya salad and thai soup and my parents liked the cashew chicken - the sauce had a great flavor. \n\nThere aren't a ton of Thai restaurants in North Scottsdale... I'd say this one is a very solid pick.
1,"We went on the Nosh Las Vegas tour June 28. Joel was our tour guide, and did an awesome job. I bought the tour off of Groupon, and it was well worth the money. We went to 5 different restaurants, Beijing #9, Payard Patisserie, Homestead Steakhouse, Gordon Ramsey's pub, and the Caesar's place food court. My favorite place was the Homestead Steakhouse, a lot of history, and the New York Strip and tater tots were to die for. There were several in the group who had already been to Gordon Ramsey's Pub, and did not give it a favorable review. But, I thought the food was very good, and thoroughly enjoyed. I also like Gordon Ramsey, met him once at a Marriott in Brooklyn, NY...nice and approachable, also an avid runner. The tour was a great run down and different look at Caesar's Place. I would definitely recommend it to everyone."
0,"I ate here after a long red-eye from San Diego and before getting on a teensy commuter flight, so maybe my two-star review is due to my general long flight grumpiness and not necessarily due to Bojangles' food. But: \n\n1) The hasbrowns / tater rounds thingies were grotie, greasy, soggy and pretty tasteless, and seemed like they had applied for jobs as hash browns at Burger King and were rejected, so came to Bojangles instead.\n\n2) The \""breakfast chicken biscuit\"" - which I'm pretty sure is just the name of the chicken biscuit when served before 10am, because it's just (wait for it, big suspense here) a piece of chicken on a biscuit - was just ok.  The biscuit was fluffy but dry, and the chicken was pretty dry too.  Tasty, but dry.\n\n3) The ice tea was gooood.  So there's that."
0,"Stay away from this train wreck of a hospital , ER is very unprofessional and I can't believe they can treat people that way. Doctors don't have any idea what they are doing, but they will take your money and if you don't like the way you where treated, to bad and good luck filing a complaint or talking to any one, they are the cricket of hospitals and if you have ever had cricket and had any problems you will be familiar with the way they do things at st lukes.

1,"If you're in Las Vegas and you're as awesome as I am, please spend an evening at Insert Coins. It sure beats a night out at one of those swanky Las Vegas clubs. \n\nLet's compare and contrast the two potential experiences.\n\nThe Cover at a Swanky Vegas Club: It tends to be free if you're a girl and $20 (or more) if you're a guy. Lame. Those clubs should be paying me for my presence.\n\nThe Cover at Insert Coins: It was free for girls and $5 for guys. Sort of lame, but it could be worse. \n\nThe Winner: Insert Coins. It's the lesser of the two evils, which is why I voted for Barack Obama in 2008.\n\nThe People at a Swanky Vegas Club: The guys usually have enough gel in their hair to glue together two bowling balls. And they tend to wear tight t-shirts with metallic prints or a dress shirts with really big stripes and maybe a skull on the back. Either fashion choice shows off their steroid influence muscles and fake tans. And yeah, they will say they are 30 and look more like 44.\n\nAs for the women, you will usually see them caked with make up, Medusa like hair extensions, one size too tight dresses from Forever 21, and heels they got on sale at Macy's, but are one half size too big. They look sloppy. So they walk around in big groups so they seem more attractive. It's the Sorority Effect. Sure, they look great in a large group. But individually, no one really stands out.\n\nThe People at Insert Coints: The guys were in jeans and t-shirts. The girls were in jeans and t-shirts.  I actually felt totally comfortable wearing a Pac-Man t-shirt, jeans, and some Star Wars shoes. And I even got compliments from men and women on my attire. It's just that kind of joint.\n\nWinner: Insert Coins. I'll take a laid back setting over a the Jersey Shore. \n\nThe Entertainment at a Swanky Vegas Club: Some random DJ who is famous for playing music off his MacBook that usually consists of electronic dance music that hasn't changed much since 1995. Sigh.\n\nThe Entertainment at Insert Coins: If you're an old school gamer, hit up the old school arcades from the 70s, 80s, and 90s. I showed off my Pac-Man skills, then played some WWF wrestling game where half of the characters were currently dead, and then moved on to some Street Fighter II and Mortal Kombat.\n\nYou can also play more current video games at the bar such as Madden, FIFA Soccer, and Tekken. And they have lounge sections with an array of choices to sit back, grab some drinks, and play video games with your friends.\n\nIn the background, there was some pretty awesome late 80s and early 90s New Jack Swing type music. So people could get up and dance the night away to New Edition and their spin off acts such as Bobby Brown, Ralph Tresvant, and Bell Biv Devoe. Best advice ever: Never trust a big butt and a smile.\n\nWinner: Insert Coins. Duh.\n\nAnyway, if you're in Las Vegas and want a break from the strip, head to Insert Coins. It's the perfect place to sit back, grab a drink, and be awesome."
0,"It's been open for approximately 2 months and they have a bit more to do to impress me. Upon entering it took a few minutes of us waiting at the front to finally be acknowledged and greeted. There's a hostess area, but no hostess.\n\nWe wanted something light, easy, and fast. We ordered a pizza special that included a drink, slice of pizza, and a salad. The pizza came out re-warmed and dry. I was not happy about them passing off fresh, gourmet pizza with a re-warm in the toaster oven appeal (I've re-warmed enough pizzas in my time that I know it when I see it). I asked the server about it and he admitted that it was not fresh and that they would make us fresh slices. The new pizza came out 10-15 minutes later and it was a stark difference compared to the initial slice. The pizza was freshly baked (not freshly made by hand) and the cheese was delicious. \n\nSome helpful tips:\n1. Do us both a favor and get it right the first time. You only have one chance to make a good first impression. Unfortunately, the initial impression I have of this establishment is disappointment. If you know you were giving out old pizza, why do it? Especially when you are a new business and you are building your reputation.\n2. If you advertise \""gourmet\"" be it. The quality of the pizza was ordinary. If you were to advertise as a regular pizza joint, I would think you were great. However, since you say you are \""gourmet\"" you have missed the mark entirely. Gourmet to me is handmade and extraordinary with toppings and spices and I didn't see that.\n3. Same line of thought...if you advertise \""organic wheat crust\"" use it. My crust was an ordinary white flour crust. \n\nThe two main reasons (gourmet and organic wheat crust) I picked this restaurant instead of the one next door were the very things that I didn't end up experiencing. \n\nThe service was okay. The restaurant itself is in a great location and is decorated very nice! I think this place has great potential, it's just getting the form and function to align (be consistent in your advertising message with the product you give to your consumer)."
1,"Forget about all the ball jokes. This is one food truck that should be taken seriously because of their tasty eats. The Godfather was a hit -- 2 ground beef meat balls with fresh basil, parsley, garlic, onions, pomodoro sauce, pecorino romano, and plenty of melted mozzarella in a soft, chewy bun. The savory meatballs had plenty of depth in flavor and were perfectly tender, not mushy.\n\nThe Zorba (ground lamb, fresh mint, oregano, parsley, garlic, served with a tomato-olive spread, lettuce, feta, red onion and homemade tzatziki sauce) was decent, but the taste of the lamb wasn't overly appealing. I did enjoy the olive spread and appreciated the subtlety of the mint, but I don't think it's a sammie I'd get again.\n\nThe pricing is as follows: 1 for $5, 2 for $9, or 3 for $12. Two sandwiches should be enough for most people, but if you're really hungry, add on a side. I was starving so I got an order of skin-on fries ($2). I have no idea if they were made fresh or were frozen, but the portion size is quite large and they were crispy, light, and delicious."
1,"Great service very reasonable prices. The food was amazing. One thing I did not understand, they do not give you an itemized receipt you have to ask for it. They can charge whatever desire. The cocktails were amazing. We took our servers suggestion and ordered the bar mans special, the cocktail was very good. When I checked in on Yelp it gave a 30% off on the cocktails for locals, but surely the manager accommodated us with the 30% off on all the cocktails we had. I can say they were very nice and tasty."
1,Good addition to Mill Ave for sure.  I like that its not your typical college bro bar. Good place for day drinking and Sunday fundays.
1,"Very good (but not perfect) and very expensive.\n\nAtmosphere & Service\nGorgeous space filled with beautiful people. The best thing about sitting down in Bartolotta is the WONDERFUL smell coming from the kitchen. I would consider coming back to sit and drink at the bar just to smell the place again. Service was fantastic, of course. I felt like our waiter's recommendations were a bit off.\n\nDrinks\nI had an immaculate sidecar. I also had a perfectly wonderful glass of some sauvignon blanc blend that was VERY good with my entree.\n\nFood\nThe bread service came out and it looked lovely but it honestly wasn't that great. Bartolotta is playing the food game at a high level, but their bread service isn't up to par with the rest of what they're doing.\n\nI ordered the sheep's milk ricotta ravioli as an appetizer - it was AMAZING. It was the best dish I tasted at Bartolotta. For my entre I chose the roast chicken, which was perfectly cooked over asparagus and some other veggies. The chicken was moist and delicious, with a nice, slightly crispy skin on top - a very nice presentation of an admittedly boring menu selection. Had I no budget to think of I would have ordered the seafood stew, but i just couldn't swing it.\n\nTwo of my friends ordered a whole fish - pink snapper? I tasted some of it and wasn't too impressed. Although the fish was cooked perfectly and the table-side preparation was fun to watch, the sauce that went with it (recommended by our waiter) wasn't a good fit. It was an olive oil and tomato number that was unbalanced, the acid overpowered the delicate nature of the fish. Had I ordered this as my entree I would have been very disappointed as it was $$$$ expensive.\n\nOverall it was a very good experience, and I wouldn't hesitate to recommend it if you've got the money to blow. I'd love to try one of the chef's tasting menus but wasn't up for the $155 price tag last night."
1,"We booked a tour to Hoover Dam through this company. The experience was positive. The driver was informative and friendly. The service was good, although they do not pick up at every hotel. There were about 4-5 specified places to be picked up. We were at the Bellagio and had to walk to Ceasar's which was no big deal. On the way home the driver dropped people wherever they wanted to go along the strip. The price was reasonable and the trip was a good value."
0,"Generic breakfast menu in a generic atmosphere attempting to impersonate a French country cabin.\n\nFor breakfast, Mimi's Cafe offers what is essentially a diner menu with some upscale dishes (quiche, variety of baked goods).  Nothing's awful here, but nothing I've had off the menu is particularly inspired or interesting.  The egg dishes are well-prepared and the sausage was good enough, but there's not much seasoning--nothing to distinguish the breakfast dishes from any diner in any city.\n\nBottom line: there's a lot better breakfast in this city, but I guess you could do a lot worse."
1,"i (thankfully!) found Liz doing a google search for Brazilian blowouts...though i was initially nervous as one might be with a new stylist, Liz immediately set my fears to rest with her extraordinary knowledge and professionalism. this was my first Brazilian blowout, and Liz totally transformed my previously unruly hair into a gorgeous silken mane...I LOVE IT!!! i have been back now for several Brazilians, each one as perfect and long-lasting as the first. though i had initially intended on just the Brazilian treatment, i was so impressed with Liz that i had her cut and style my hair too...best thing i ever did! Liz is a master stylist using only the most advanced cutting techniques...all her cuts are very up to date and absolutely on-trend. now i receive compliments on my hair everywhere i go, from complete strangers!  even my teenage daughter is hooked on Liz, and won't let anyone else touch her hair! if you are considering a new stylist, or maybe just a change, you absolutely must try Liz, i guarantee you will NOT be disappointed!!!"
0,We went to this location last night for my birthday. Well it wasn't a very happy birthday. Our server was Buddy and he wasn't very friendly. He kinda just threw our stuff at us. He seemed like he didn't want to be there. His bad mood started to make me get into a bad mood. My boyfriend had mentioned to him that it was my birthday and he didn't even ask if I wanted anyone to sing and bring out a dessert. He didn't say anything about it. No happy birthday. Nothing about out costumes. We actually had another sever come up to us and talk to us about our costumes and was super friendly. I wish I had gotten his name and I wish we had him as a server. \n\nMy food was ok. My boyfriend said his pizza was terrible. \n\nOverall last night was a horrible experience. Now I know not to go to this location for a late dinner.
0,"$3 mixed drinks got us in.  The empty bar, techno music and lack of anyone else made us leave after our first drink.\n\nWalked by later.  Place was packed with girls sitting around and a bunch of dudes turning it out to Rihanna on the dance floor...not that there's anything wrong with that."
1,What a great place! I walked right in was greeted at the door. We told them it was our first time here. I was offered a beer and a seat. Their hummus was home made and awesome. Everyone here was super attentive and very nice. Just an all around good night. Will for sure be back.
0,Its just keeps getting worse. Now its not even a hand wash anymore and it seems like they are more concerned with speed than quality or customer service.
1,"I've been to a several Valley resort spas and this one doesn't disappoint.  \n\nI guess rating and reviewing spas can be a bit tricky as not only treatments depend upon the staff but expectations and use of the facilities varies from person to person.  I'm a massage fan and love to use the steam, sauna, pool, and workout facilities.  Plush lounge areas and well-stocked shower and locker rooms are pluses.\n\nThe pool and pool area at this resort spa was the biggest that I've experienced.  Plenty of lounge chairs and a swimming area larger than average.  I also enjoyed 1 of the 2 outdoor showers.  Can't explain it but you'll know what i mean when you try it.  Made me want 2 get one for my home.\n\nBut i digress, the spa also has a decent cafe overlooking the pool area and the upstairs lounge area was very comfortable.  Need to go back soon!"
0,Cute small place.  We had 8 of us thank goodness we had a reservation but the food took so long:  From appetizers to our actually meals. They forgot a lot.  Our drinks were also empty.  The servers are hit and miss:  1 server was helpful and 1 server was not happy to be there.  It was like we were bothering her.
0,"Disappointing is all I can say.  My husband and I just happened to be driving by and decided to stop in for lunch.  Decor is very bright and pleasant.  A nice salsa bar with several choices, however, the pico de gallo and mild salsa were extremely bland, no salt, tang or heat at all.  The chips were free, but almost chewy instead of crisp.\n\nMy husband ordered the ceviche tostada (good) and the pozole (passable), mine was a little worse.  I ordered the three item combo so I could sample a few things to get a better idea of the food.  The green chile and cheese tamale was flavorless, lots of thick masa with canned green chiles in the middle and no cheese I could find.  The beef taco on a hard shell was unseasoned pot roast on a soggy taco shell, and the cheese enchilada arrived cold with a very thick red sauce.  The refried beans were unpleasantly pasty instead of smooth and creamy and, again, unseasoned and the rice had no flavor or seasoning at all (there seems to be a pattern here with the cooks not seasoning or tasting the food going out)\n\nPrice for this was $20 without any drinks (water only) so not terrible price wise, but considering the poor flavor and quality it was not worth it.  Needless to say, we will not be back."
0,"Here's a place that tries to be too French even though they are not French.  By that I mean they are arrogant.  Very nice food but apparently having a reservation and being a loyal diner who recommends the place means nothing to this snobbish group.  A specific request for a table next to the fireplace was simply not granted when it was obvious it could have been.  One round table was given to a 6 while we were 5 and the other close table was set for 4 when it could have been made for a 5 just as the table offered next to the entrance of the patio entrance and main walkway in was.  They could have given us the other table and switched the 4 for  5 and visa to accommodate us but they flat out refused. A location next to their fireplace was requested days in advance and as usual it was a cold AZ night in January.  When our displeasure was indicated to them they basically said \""tough luck\"".  When I asked for the owner/chef to say something to before we left for another restaurant they acted like he was not available.  When i noticed him behind the curtain I waved to him asking to speak to him.  He did come out and when I noted our disappointment he immediately verbally attacked me for in his eyes pointing at him when I clearly waved at him to indicate I wanted to speak to him.  He is too pompous for words and this small restaurant will stay small and eventually sink into failure as many in Yelp have indicated for poor and pompous service.  If one wants to be treated to rudeness at a French restaurant try it, but for that I suggest going to France to enjoy the country as this is note that quaint a location.  With so many fine restaurant choices in Phoenix and Scottsdale why go to a place that treats you poorly even after being  there a number of times."
0,"Not good.  Minimum amount is done for the $ 19.99 wash.   Seats were not wiped down, no armor all done or rain ex for that price.  Vacuuming was also poor.  Will avoid in future. \nFor the $19.99 wash they do not amor all the tires or give it that extra clean that other car washes provide."
0,"Dont ever go there gamble.\n\nI go there for blackjack on my 21st birthday on Nov 26,2014, 11:30pm. \nThe manager looks fucking upset and ask me do not win anymore...\nfor three times... every time he pass by. \n WTFi leave immediately. \n\nFuck you.   If you cant lose, close the casino or quit your risk job. \n\nNever go back again."
0,"If I were just able to give this place a zilch (0) rating, I WOULD!\n\nWhen I was about 7 years old, my Dad cooked my sister, my brother and me some sort of eggplant dinner.  I don't know what it is about eggplant (since then and up until now) but neither three of us were able to stand the horrid/sour/bitter taste of it (kapooey).  My brother, who was six years of age back then, was forced to finish up every bite of the eggplant that was staring him down on his plate.  He took a couple of bites and then regurgitated it all up back on his plate.  My dad had fumes and steam and redness marked all over his face/neck and we knew he was thinking \""you have DISRESPECTED MY COOKING!\"" It was instantly after throwing it up that my Father told my brother to spoon up the eggplant and eat it all within 5 minutes, or ELSE! So my brother did what he was told and re-consumed every single bite  on his plate.  We were ALL traumatized by this pitiful event.  \n\nWith that said, I would rather go through that eggplant experience again and eat my own vomit than ever go back to LAX in in the Luxor, Vegas!  That place had no dancefloor, no ventilation and you can see all the smoke from cigarettes circulate the air because the venue is so damn small! Enough said.....Major NAY for LAX!"
0,"I ate at Olive's in NYC and gave it 2 stars but the LV-Olives is even worse! Our waiter was retarded: he messedup the order at least 3 times. He was so confused. We ordered the flat bread and it came with no cheese and it wasnt cooked. WTF? What a big disappointment. Once again, nice decor, okay service and good drinks = big bill. im dont like these \""new-American\"" eateries. The food is so dull every time."
0,"My husband and I really wanted to like this place since it's a Foodfight owned establishment and we love some of their other restaurants. We walked in hoping to sit outside and noticed there were two empty tables in their patio area. We were told it would probably be a 15 minute wait, no problem, so we sat at the bar. \n\nThe bar was steady but not packed - there were even some empty stools. There were two bartenders working and we noticed there were quite a few interesting microbrews on tap we wanted to try. However, we sat at the bar for almost 15 minutes and neither bartender ever even came and talked to us. We walked out.\n\nThere are a LOT of great restaurants in the Madison area, so Craftsman Table & Tap will need to step up their game big time if they want to stick around."
1,Loooove this place!  Great waffles!
0,"(I initially posted this on the wrong location.) \nI don't love these burgers. The staff was friendly enough. That's the one star.\n\nWe got here around 8pm on a Thursday. It was positively deserted, save the wax figure of The Rock accosting you upon entry. (I have no idea what that's about.)\n\nThe burgers, for the smallest one, is $5.99.  And if you want anything on it, it's a $1 per item. And if you want fries and a drink? ANOTHER $4.99!  So basically, you're paying like $12-$15 for a burger n' fries. If I'm going to spend that much, I'll blow the extra $5 and go to Holstein's. If I'm eating food out of a basket, I expect to pay under $10 for it.\n\nThe atmosphere is very \""off campus burger joint\"", not something you'd find in Town Square. But a college student couldn't afford to eat here.\n\nIt was all tables and chairs, so it didn't really seem like the kind of place you'd hang out in and drink beers at happy hour, which is something they push heavily. There's lots of ads and chalkboards for happy hour cocktails and beer bucket specials.  \n\nTheir burger options were kind of minimal, too. The turkey burger seemed to only be available if you got it with cranberries and stuffing, which defeats the purpose of a healthy turkey burger. No bun options, either, so no wheat for me.\n\nSo I got the smallest burger they offered (5 oz).  When it finally arrived (we waited quite a while), it seemed like far more than 5oz.  And it was DENSE, like a hockey puck kinda. It didn't taste bad, per se, just a bit dry and like I said, dense. It was a bit bland, as well. \n\nI asked the hostess what kind of beef they served and she proudly declared, \""100% angus beef!\"" and I said, \""can you tell me how much fat? Like is it 80/20 or 85/15?\""  I asked because usually a burger that dense and dry is rocking a 7% fat content.\n\nAfter, I swear to god, 15 minutes and lots of confusion and chicken without a head-type running around, the cook came out and told me -- get this -- \""It's 80/20, but when we're done cooking it, it's 85/15.\""\n\nThat's not quite how that works, sport, but ok.  It's one or the other, you don't have the authority to determine how much fat is in it after you've cooked it. You have to go by what's in it before.  But after all that running around and looking in the freezer, clearly, no one has any idea what they're cooking.\n\nI shan't be going back here, unfortunately.  Like I said, the staff was nice enough, but other than that, it's not my bag."
1,"It seems that most of the reviews here are very polemic, either you love or hate the place. I have to say that I lean more towards the former. I actually am a pretty big fan. I've been here 3 or 4 since it opened and have always enjoyed the cool, mature, sophisticated vibe here. I really enjoy the crowd that it draws in Lawrenceville, mostly younger professional people. The tap list here is quite extensive, and the variety and diversity of the liquor menu is incredible. You will find bourbons here that you probably can't find anywhere else in the city. I was actually here when the ball dropped on New Year's, and while the place was crazy, I still enjoyed the crowd and drinks, and the bartenders were still able to keep up (and even serve a free glass of champagne to everyone at the bar!). I have to say that I've never tried the food here, so I'm far overdue to sit down for dinner sometime. Unfortunately, it's become a madhouse on the weekends now because of novelty and word-of-mouth, so for a meal I'll definitely need to stop in sometime during the week. I love how this place has carved out its own niche at the perfect location on Butler."
0,"Been there for lunch a couple of times. The first time I was not impressed, and rather neutral about the experience. But I thought it was because I was on the phone w/ biz the entire time. \n\nWent last week w/ a few folks from my office. Omg! We were thoroughly disappointed. Let's start w/ the chips and salsa. They serve a complementary salsa trio. Red, green and pico de gallo. The traditional salsa was borderline gross! No flavor and funky texture. The salsa verde was ok but not great. I asked for hot salsa....they didn't have one. Huh??! \n\nThe food was par at best and the service was worse! The restaurant was not busy and we had to search for our server for any and everything. We had to ask for our check and 15 min later, she still hadn't come to collect the bill. Tick Tock! Tick Tock! C'mon lady....I've got stuff to do!!! I had to take the credit card to her!!! \n\nThe icing on the cake was my asking for a to-go cup for my freshly poured iced tea. She brought me a soup container!! No thanks! \n\nMeh! I'm cool on this place!"
1,"Great rooms, We had a living room and a bedroom with one and a half baths and even a TV in the master bath, we thoroughly enjoyed our stay for my boyfriends birthday.  A bit far to walk down the strip but the Mandalay Bay and the adjoining hotels have plenty to do."
0,"If you're looking for authentic mexican - this is NOT the place for you.  If you are looking for a Tex Mex BBQ joint masking as a Fine Mexican restuarant this IS the place for you.  We tried the shredded beef tacos and shredded pork burro.  The tacos were good - not as good as Los Dos Molinos or Guedo's though.  The burro had so much BBQ sauce I could only eat about 1/3 before I gave up.  The rice was delicious and the refried beans were ok - a little too much BBQ sauce again.  The chips and salsa were good.  Drinks were a little expensive - $4.25 for Dos Equis.  Service was almost too effecient.  It seemed they wanted us out of there quickly - never asked if we wanted another drink and kept coming back to clear plates.  Very nice service staff, simple atmosphere, nice patio,  prices a little too high.  Not authentic enough for me to return."
0,"Only scoring a two star because the food was edible and the vibe of the place was very cool. After spending a lot of dough on an amazing meal at STK the night before we decided on a more casual less expensive (or so we thought!) one. Todd English has gotten a lot of buzz on Top Chef so why not? Well this is why not: the food was ridiculously overpriced, carelessly made and couldn't hold a candle to any nickel and dime pub in Great Britain for a tenth of the cost. My $20 plate of corned beef was so cold I had to send it back, when it came back the flavor wasn't even up to Costco's high standard and the cioppino tasted like a pile of boiled seafood doused with a canned spaghetti sauce. I nearly spit up a gold tooth when I saw the bill was $87 before the tip!! $20 for one beer flight of four tiny tastes? Really? The only thing I enjoyed about my meal was the French onion soup but beware for $9 it'll be half the size of the one you are used to. This place is a miss for me. Not coming back unless Todd invites me to dine for free."
1,"You'll notice a huge age discrepency, really young kids and then there are the adults of all ages.  So I give credz to any insitution that tries to keep kids engaged in using their minds  vs getting their game on in the mall.\n\nI love science museums, making a point to attend in any big city I travel to.  The exhibits seem lacking (even in simple terms) of the magic behind the science... hence probably why the feedback this place is so kids orientated."
0,"I really can't add anything that hasn't already been said.  Save yourself a lot of $$ and DO NOT go here unless you already purchased a Groupon.  In that case use the Groupon and then ask for a refund because the food is THAT BAD.  The food is also way over priced.  Lethal combo in my book.  The service was OK, but not great by any means."
1,"Have to start with the white sangria....AMAZING!  My friend and I ordered a pitcher and couldn't finish the rest. Good and nice portions!  I ordered a burger with chiles. Soooo good.  Mac and Cheese was fantastic too.  I splurged a lot this evening and had the flourless chocolate cake with vanilla gelato.  The cake was good, but very rich so share! I will definitely return."
1,"Best NY style pizza you can get in the area.  Whether it's late night, or delivery, you're going to get delicious pizza, crispy but not floppy crust, and a mouthful of gooey cheese that sits well, is flavorful and doesn't drip.  People write a lot about how it's too greasy, etc etc, if that turns you off, then just go to Crust or something!  I think people who enjoy Joe's know what they're getting and are big fans of it.  \n\nGet some!!"
1,Great black bean burger on a wheat bun.  Fries are near perfect.  Price is fair.  Staff is friendly and helpful.  I've eaten at Smashburger over a dozen times and it is very consistent.
0,So came here for a friends birthday. Yes we were a larger party (15 people) however we had called ahead and told server ahead of time for the check splitting. The server was not attentive. We sat for extended periods without drinks. Our water glasses were filled though because the busser was amazing.  Half the table waited for almost 40 mins to get the checks and to pay and there was still confusion about who's check was who's.  Will think again before coming here. Over 3 hours for a dinner..no thank you.
1,"Great museum! A lot of info on native culture. If your visiting, this is a great place to visit and learn about the different tribes."
0,"I usually love Aladdin's but today it was unbelievably awful. I will go back again and hope things have changed. \nFor starters they charged me twice for tea (4.50) b/c they gave me a second tea bag. Had I known that it would cost me an additional 2.25 for a single bag of cheap tea I would not have ordered it. The least the waitress could have done is have told me that my \""free refill\"" was not, in fact, free. \nAlso, the tuna in the grilled tuna salad was disgustingly fishy and overcooked. I usually order something different (the mishwi or lamb salad) so I am unsure if this is how it usually is but also the fact that no one seemed willing to fix the issue makes it far worse. \n\nI told the waitress that she should have told me about the extra charges and her answer was that I was correct about her having to tell me but that she didn't and basically that sucks for me. No answer on the fish. \n\nI have been a long time customer and am sorely irritated that I was treated this way."
0,"Worst experience ive ever had trying to watch Monday Night Football at a restaurant/sports bar that promotes coming down to watch the big game at this Henderson location. Don't even try to get there early with a party of people to watch a game on a TV right in front of you, because they will change channnel completely for someone strolling in late at bar....right in middle of it...even after they ask you if you're watching game on a particular tv and you say \""YES\""..please dont change it. The manager changed the channel and than hid from us and sent a waiter over as \""acting supervisor\"". Ive never seen a bar allow a group of people to leave over a \""buddy\"" at the bar. Good business model. The female bartender thought it was funny too.. Oh...and expect to deal with plenty of children near the bar area too as they sat a birthday party nearby with loud children everywhere right a few feet from bar area. The biggest shame is we used to be \""regulars\"" last season that supported this local business. The food wasnt bad, but clearly its not run very well. They have lost my business for good as we will drive farther to spend lots of money elsewhere. Oh..and the waiter also collected our email and phone numbers before the game for a $100 bar tab raffle that never happened...felt like a scam. Never go back."
1,"I'm sure the lunch special has been mentioned many times in reviews, but it really can't be beat. Such a nice place to have lunch and escape the casino noise. You can enjoy 3 courses for around $23. The bread and olive oil is very good. I ordered the greek meze plate (dip trio), the Lavraki (grilled bass), and fresh fruit. I left feeling full but still light, and the service was very good. I would recommend Estiatorio Milos to anyone that wants to have a nice lunch in Vegas without breaking the bank."
1,"The brisket is the best we ever had.  Just the brisket itself would be 5 stars.\n\nParking: the parking lot is very small.  When we leave the parking lot, you have to drive to the back of the parking lot and exit onto the side street.  The side street has cars park on both sides and is only wide enough for one car to pass through.  When we were leaving, we nearly got hit by a car that was making a left turn onto the street.  Just be careful.\n\nService: great service. The hostess greeted us warmly.  Our waiter was very friendly and keep our drinks filled up.\n\nFood: Other than the brisket, I only liked the sweet potato fries.  These were the other things we ordered:\n- Pimento cheese fries: Crinkle fries tasted like the frozen kind.  It was very cheesy.  My kids absolutely loved it.  \n- Smoked wings: too much smoke flavor for me\n- BBQ Pork Sandwich: It was pretty good.  \n- Combo platter (pig out): Three of us shared this platter and we still had left over.  We picked 2 portions of combined (fat + lean) brisket, sausage and ribs.  And the side items were mac n' cheese and sweet potato fries.  Everyone loved the brisket.  The sweet potato fries were one of the best ones I had.  I didn't like the hush puppies or the mac n' cheese at all.    \n\nTwo days later, we stopped by and bought a pound of briskets (from the bulk order) to go.  The bulk order would need 24 hour advance notice.  We were lucky that they had enough for us to buy it that day.  By the time we got to our hotel, the brisket was cold.  It was still very good.\n\nIf we are in the area again, we will definitely stop by to get some brisket."
1,"Yum!!! This review is based on their milkshakes. Spiked milkshakes that is. After dinner, my friends and I went to the bar and wanted to try their milkshakes. My friend and I split the captain crunch milkshake. It is definitely better to share. It can be very heavy and they give you more than just one cup of it. They give you the left overs in another cup. You can definitely taste the alcohol in the shake, but it's not heavy enough that you will feel it unless you are low tolerance.\n\nI also got to try and grasshopper and the oreo shakes. Both of them were great as well. You can walk into the bar and seat yourself. We got there about 8:15pm and it was busy busy on a Friday night! \n\nNext time, I do want to try their food. :)"
1,"Absolutely luv this place! Tina is my go-to manicurist & she's amazing! Never have I bleed from her doing my nails, always friendly & we talk the entire time! Lol I'm glad I found this place!!"
1,"This was my first time here. I was greeted warmly by all the front office staff and offered a cold bottle of water. The person checking me in was friendly and helpful.  I hardly had to wait even though I was early.  The office itself is very nice and comfortable with plenty of magazines to read and a children's waiting area. The dental assistant that did my x-rays was very nice and friendly. The dentist, Dr Amanda, was also very friendly and gentle. She really listened to my concerns and gave me her full attention. Overall it was a great experience for someone who generally is fearful of going to the dentist. Highly recommend this office."
0,"Wow... The owner has real guts to call his restaurant as \""Indian restaurant\""... It taste nowhere close to food... Every thing is frozen... Do not recommend..."
0,Too pricey for the quality.
0,"Im giving this 1 stars because it is a very long time from the time I drop of my dog to picking up. 5 hours. also I took him before and they did an okay job not the best but i figured for the price I would give it another try. this time i took him i did not like the hair cut on my dog i asked for a lion cut, and they cut him completely down on the head and left all his hair on his right leg all the way up and his left leg was shaved down. Also his paws were completely messed up. I have included pictures. And also I got a full groom, which meant a bath included. Well my dogs ears were still dirty and it looked like they forgot to bathe him, and he smelled like he did before. And usually he smells good after a groom. Im like so mad about this. The price is good, but I don't think they will be going back after this last experience."
0,Wings were OK. Liked the Yella Pilsner draft special. Decent dive bar. Real good ranch!
1,Great service all around.  Theses guys are awesome with fades and lineups.  I have been going here for one year.  I am really picky when it comes to my fades and lineups. I would recommend this place!
1,"I LOVEDDDD Mon Ami Gabi! We went here for brunch and were able to sit outside and watch the fountains across the way at the Bellagio. I had a crab cake as an appetizer that was a little slice of heaven. The rest of our food was good as well. If your going to go here I would stay away from the ordinary club type sandwiches (turkey, cheese, bacon) they are just regular sandwiches. Go out of your box and try something different. That's what my friend and I did and we were impressed with our food. (She had a crab sandwich and I had a french crepe. Our hubbys ordered the reg. sandwiches which were nothing special)  I would definately love to go back to try the dinner menu and I'm so glad they have a Mon Ami Gabi over here in Chicago for me to go try."
1,"Food is good, nice family owned place, and I love that they have a TV!\nThe prices are decent and I like their specials.. Free or included stuff is a plus!"
1,"I am bumping them up to 4 stars b/c of the Latkes!\n\nI had Latkes for the first time here. SOOO GOOOD!!! \n\nWhat is Latkes? They are potato pancakes--shallow-fried pancakes of grated or ground potato, flour and egg,  flavored with grated onion or garlic and seasoning.\n\nOrdered:\n1) Latkes: 5/5 SO GOOD---most likely SUPER unhealthy, but who cares?! :)\n2) Chicken avocado sandwich: 3/5 Typical--good but nothing extraordinary\n3) 7 layer cake 2/5: Of course..we had to order desserts...This was actually disappointing--not as good as it looks."
1,"We were excited about this place and it didn't disappoint.  We moved 2 months ago and have been here 4 times already!  The house margarita is fantastic.  They have a lot of great options for margaritas but we just can't bring ourselves to try something different.  They offer 2 types of salsa for dipping, one is red and served warm the other green. I've never had warm salsa but it's delicious!  The food is always good.  Make sure to check out the test menu, it is at the back of the menu.  It contains items they are considering adding the menu permanently and it contains some gems you don't want to miss."
0,"I was with my sister on Mill Ave looking for some food to eat. We thought Greek would be awesome but then we saw Crave was gone and My Brg Fat Greek burned down. So we came across MedFresh and decided to give it a go. We both ordered gyros with lamb and beef and some hummus. First of all, the hummus had a strange aftertaste, I decribed it as if there was whiskey or some sort of alcohol in it. It was tolerable to eat but I wouldn't order it again. Then our gyros came out and I didn't like the flavors that came with it. It had too much stuff in it like pickles, lettuce, onions, not sure what I normally have in a gyro but it just didn't taste right. So we left and my plate had half a gyro and a lot of stale fries that I couldn't eat. The staff was very nice and attentive but the food quality will cause me to never return."
1,"It's like a portal into a chasm of anime, classics, world, documentary and varied films and cartoons. For Champaign, these guys really have an outstanding collection of rare films.\n\nWhat prevents me from giving it 5 starts is their stupid rule that you must have a special card and meet special requirements to rent a film from them, including being over 18 (for *ANY* film)"
1,"Tried this place out for the first time food was awesome! I would definitely go back the only let down was the service was kind of crummy, there server did not seem like she wanted to be there... maybe it was an off night or something"
0,I liked the atmosphere but was overall underwhelmed with the food.
0,Took a 30 dollar cab ride there for lunch feb 11 /14 got there  and there were 4 people in there got a drink went outside to sit and eat sat there over a hour never seen the girl bartender again watched lots of people come in and walk out .we decided to leave had to wait to pay our bill WORST place in vegas . went next door to hash a go go had a 145.00 lunch excellent. Took a 30.00 cab ride back to our hotel. DONT go to vamps.
1,"This is my sister's restaurant, so I am a little biased but the food is great and the owners are great!!! :) I recommend the wings, Gyro, turkey BLT, or cheese steak.  I also love the zucchini sticks."
0,"We've had their over priced food before and it was good, but not worth the money. This time we went there twice for to-go items. We tried a sandwich and salad (chicken salad sandwich is bland, get some flavorful chips to put inside it) and both were reasonable in size and price. The next day we grabbed yogurt parfaits for breakfast. They were good size and fresh but still expensive for what they were. they also dont have spoons that reach the bottom, so you have to get yogurt on your hand to get it all"
0,"The customer service is ridiculous because the server has no service skill at all. I ordered a Pho special TO-GO, the soup and the meats are cold. I called to the restaurant, the server said she though I will eat it at home, so I can microwave it. She also mentioned  most of customers would do it that way. WT Pho... \""most of \"" is not equal \""all of \"", at least she needs to ask the customer first, before she put in the order."
1,"My boyfriend said \""this is the best pizza he's ever had in his entire life\"" and I agree. It really is a secret... A waiter from a previous restaurant told us about it when we mentioned we were staying at the Cosmo. I had a vegetarian salad and it was extremely fresh. The guy at the register was super friendly and super cute which only made my experience here better:) you have to ask a security guard where it is exactly....I honestly felt cool knowing about this secret:):)"
0,"I'm sorry, what? This place was the worst! First of all, it's a major dive in a thoroughly sketchy area (shares parking lot with really gross strip club and there's another one across the street.) The food is horrible! Horrible! Thick, bland, raw flour tasting breading with not a speck of seasoning to be found. $4.35 for a bowl of bad canned clam chowder. Fries were soggy and bland. Clams were bland as well, I've had frozen that were better. Cocktail sauce was even bland. Seriously, if you like eating at convalescent homes this is your place. Otherwise, look elsewhere."
1,"This is a great neighborhood joint!  I walked in a little before 11 and a group of women were in the corner, playing scrabble or some sort of game--clearly they were regulars.  The atmosphere is bare bones, but comfortable.  for lunch I had the tuna sandwich--this was a great sandwich--the proportion of tuna to apple was just right.  I will definitely be putting Bertha's on my rotation for a great place to go for a great sandwich."
0,"I too am also a fan of other FOX concept resturaunts but Sauce was extremely disappointing. Had seen the location at the Scottsdale Water Front but never seemed enticed enough to enter until the other night. My cousin and I met up at a central location and unfortunately this seemed like the best option in the Norterra lot.\n\nHe had a pizza, which for my opinion are over-priced for their quality and size. Their menu doesn't span much taste-buds but can get any general idea of a \""classy\"" pizza across. It was burnt and too crispy, even for just a plan pepperoni and cheese, it was boring.\n\nTorn between wanting some pizza and a salad, I ordered their \""greek\""ish salad which was pretty good. Although it was delicious, the salad was way to rich to eat entirely by one's self.  \n\nI was mostly turned off by their service of wine in what appeared to be a juice cup. Maybe thats fine for my kitchen but thats at home where it doesn't cost per glass. My Mom informed me later that in a juice cup is actually how they drink it ususally across the Atlantic. hmp, didn't know that. \n\nAll in all, don't think I'll be getting sauced with Sauce again."
1,1. Great food and selection. (For a buffet).\n2. South Phoenix (my negative point)\n3. Awesome looking dessert (was too full to try)
1,"This is the only nail salon where you are guaranteed not to have to wait when you walk in with no appointment. Love, love, love this place!"
1,"Kennywood isn't a big corporate mega park. Thank god for that.\n\nWhat does Kennywood have that the corporate parks don't?\n-Affordable admissions prices\n-Quality park food and affordable prices (Potato Patch, hello?)\n-A fun atmosphere that isn't dominated by arbitrary \""rules\"" and \""policies\""\n-Classic rides that you can't find anywhere else\n\nKennywood doesn't have the most roller coasters, but who cares? The rides that the park does have are downright fun. Seriously, have you ever been on a wooden coaster at Cedar Point or Kings Island? OUCH!\n\nIf you want to pay for a close-in parking space, that's cool; if not, that's OK too. At Kennywood, you can bring your own picnic lunch INTO the park. Unlike the corporate parks, I never feel like I'm being gouged or taken advantage of while inside the gates.\n\nThis park has stood the test of time and it remains one of the best in America. I'll happily skip every Six Flags and Cedar Fair owned park on my way to get to Kennywood."
0,"Horrible first impression. Waiting in the lobby for our two bedroom suite to be finished cleaning while everyone else is checking in so easily. It's been almost 2 hours. My party is tired and exhausted. To get my room key will be the 3rd time I've had to wait in the check in line. \n\nSorry Mirage but you have left a bad taste in my mouth and my first impression of this hotel is bad. Even after the check in time, you shouldn't make guests wait no longer then an hour for their room to be ready.  \n\nI normally stay at the Venetian/Palazzo which offers excellent customer service and  never had to wait for my room to be \""ready\"". In fact, of the 10+ years of my numerous Vegas visits to other hotels had I had to wait so long for a room. \n\nEdit: after much complaining to the front desk. they finally offered another room after two and a half hours later. Their excuse? Our room was still getting cleaned and they are going to give us another room that they were holding for one of their VIP guests. \n\nIt was disappointing because this was my birthday weekend for my big 30! My party and I wanted to watch the Boys to Men concert, but by the time we finally got to our room we were exhausted and missed it! \n\nAfter speaking to about 5 different different people at the front desk, it was clear to see that they need to train some of their staff better with customer service. One of them was extremely rude to my sister, an Asian guy with a shaved head. I wish I took his name down. He was an ass to us. \n\nBesides all the drama, I absolutely love our two bedroom suite and the view it has to offer, therefore I'm giving the Mirage two stars."
0,good location in the airport but the food was sub par.... not houstons like the hillstone chain...
0,"To be honest, I found this place \""unimpressive\"". It seems to be a \""skater\"" place. The young man behind the counter seemed to be rebuilding a friends unit and didn't want to see me. When he did help, he and his friend started making off color jokes, making me a little hot under the collar. Think I'm gonna be passing on this store."
0,"This was my 2nd trip to Ibiza. It has great decor and we really like tapas, so we decided to try it again. The first time we were VERY disappointed, the waiter was not good and the food was actually bad. So thinking we must have just ordered the wrong things we went back. The waiter this time was excellent. Unfortunately the food still horrible. The best thing about the meal was the free bread. I do not recommend this place at all, it is expensive and the food is not good."
0,"Good food, but they are so slow. I think they need to realize that lunch at a counter service place needs to be served quickly. I keep coming back every few months to see if they have improved, once they do I will be eating lunch here at least every week or two."
0,"Visited during lunch, so so meal. Chickrn was alittle dry but fresh veggies/rice was perfect. Annoyed with bird flying around inside restaurant as you ate. Please remove has to be sanitary issue."
0,"Whats a terrible place to eat! Overpriced and terrible service,  how can a place like stay in business,  went to celebrate a birthday with a group of friends.  First the waitress was awful, since we were a group of people she didnt have to work too hard since the gratuity was already included in the bill. What a dump! Plus all the food that was ordered was salty!!! I rather starve."
0,"Glad I wasn't in a hurry. Took about 75 min. To get our food. The table of 8 who gave there order got food their food 30min before us. We had great view patio seat, but something not right with how kitchen is run."
1,"My awesome boyfriend bought tickets for our 5 year anniversary.  Our seats were Section 1, Row Q, Seats 9 and 10 (if you face the stage the seats are on the far right hand side). \n\nThe beginning was a tad bit slow and I even caught myself dozing off...BUT as soon as they broke into the 1st song I was hooked.  I was amazed at the amount of songs I knew and even more amazed that they were all sung by the Four Seasons (I'm horrible when it comes to naming songs and the singer or group who sang them). The guy who played Frankie Valli was awesome while the guy who played Bob Gaudio was cute.\n\nMy biggest regret about the show was not buying the Jersey Boys soundtrack in the lobby area at the end of the show  !&$#@\n\nSince watching the show if I ever hear a Four Seasons song on the radio, I crank up the volume and starting singing the words to the best of my ability!  These particular songs will always remind me of what a great night me and boyfriend had while watching the show:\n\n\""Working My Way Back to You\""\n\""Sherry\""\n\""Can't Take My Eyes Off You\""\n\""Oh What a Night\""  \n\""Walk Like a Man\""\n\nA TOTAL MUST SEE IN VEGAS!!!"
0,"BEWARE!! He's a SALESMAN, NOT AN ETHICAL DENTIST. By far the WORST dentist I have ever been to. Even though he knew I worked at a dental school, and know A LOT more than an average patient about dentistry, he still proceeded to \""diagnose\"" $5300 worth of treatment for fillings, crowns, etc. I had my x-rays looked at my 5 dentists at work in the next week. I didnt have a single cavity. I only actually needed 1 filling. If you want to go to someone who will tell you that you need restorations on every tooth, he's your man. Also, the hygienist did not display proper infection control technique. Who knows what bacteria/disease may be in that office."
0,"Dirty, dirty, dirty. The health department should close this place down. My shoes were sticking to the floor.  Worst food ever too! Save your money."
0,"If I could choose no stars for this place I would. The only thing that was decent was the waitress. She was super sweet. \nFirst, I have never had fish and chips that was not edible. Until now that is. The grease was literally pooled on my plate. Even after soaking it up with a napkin it was swimming. I cut into it and the fish wasn't even cooked. Gross\nMy friend ordered the pot roast. One bite and she was done. I think her words were something akin to \""dog food.\"" \nIf this wasn't bad enough, we actually got charged for this crap. Don't waste your time with this place. I certainly won't."
1,"I really never cared all that much for the Beatles. I'm a Kiss fan first. I guess what really never appealed to me was their lack of \""stage presence\"". It's pretty non-existent. \n\n\nEnter Vegas and 2 tickets to  The Beatles:LOVE show. Let's just say that your humble narrator barley standing before you got choked up within the first 10 minutes of the show. When \""Get Back\"" hit and the four silhouettes start jamming on the big screens--I was a goner! \n\nThe show was a bombastic visual assault on the senses! The highlights were many, which included giant waves that flow into the crowd...it must be seen to be believed.  Eleanor Rigby is also pretty great as the characters are on stage in the flesh; Father McKenzie & Eleanor Rigby, etc...\n\nAfter the show I picked up the 2 disc set of the soundtrack which rocks, and we listened to it on the way back home. The first disc is a cd and the second disc is an audio dvd--mastered in 5.1 Dolby Digital surround sound.\n\nOut of all the Cirque shows I've seen, LOVE is my favorite. I'm still high off of it. Everyone should check this out at least once. I can't wait to go back!"
0,Lady at counter says even though I declined navigation option she is going to charge me anyway. I told her I was a Gold member for 10 years and she said so what. Grrrrrr Fail
0,"Started off the morning with fresh squeezed OJ, I must point out it was the bomb! Their OJ is notably very good. My friend ordered the dulce latte, also very good. The server didn't appear to be very knowledgeable or very attentive. I ordered strawberry banana ricotta pancakes with side of HLK potatoes, 2 eggs, & sausage. My friend had the loch duarte salmon in which my friend mistakenly thought it was salmon lox. We thought we confirmed with the server that it was a lox but it turns out to be pan seared salmon oopsies! It was quite bit of surprise when the salmon came out. My eggs came out first then 6 minutes later my pancakes and sausages arrived. I guess my potatoes were never placed through. The portion sizes of everything were pretty big. The pancakes were soft and succulent complimented with coconut syrup. For a side order of sausages it came with 3!!! The salmon was decent over a bed of grilled veggies. Ultimately, the food isn't anything mind blowing, the service could definitely use improvement and delivery of time could use a little bit of help as well. I should've been advised of the chefs specials before I placed my order but I noticed on my own in the back of the restaurant on a board."
1,"Whoever said the portions here are small must eat some serious food! Yes, the portion sizes are small, but c'mon, it's an all-you-can-eat buffet! Have 10 rounds if you're that hungry. I thought the sizes were just perfect. Served in their own cute, little platters, everything they offered was so rich and savory! Here's a sampling of what I tried:\n\n-Risotto with mushroom medley\n-Collared greens and ham hocks\n-Prime rib (and they can cook it a little more if it's too raw for you\n-Custom mac and cheese bar. I had crab, mushroom, bacon and sun dried tomatoes on mine.\n-Bone marrow spread for your bread...heh, not my taste, but worth trying.\n-Truffle ravioli\n-Grilled salmon\n-Grilled shrimp on risotto\n-An assortment of dessert options (i.e. fried beignet with coffee sauce)\n\n\nVerdict? Wicked Spoon=Wicked Good! One of the best Vegas buffets I've tried, ever. There are lots of buffets worth checking out in Vegas and this one should definitely be one of them! Plus, it's an excuse to come visit one of the newer hotels on the strip, and probably one of the last ones to be built for awhile. So purrty!"
1,"I've gone a couple of times..one for brunch & one for dinner. I've been surprised both times! Going in & not knowing what to expect made it even better/easier to choose on the menu.\n\nHuge pancakes with bacon induced bloody mary is a great combination!! Be ready to saddle up to the table with their huge, tasty flapjacks! They thought of lil details and did have sugar free syrup available.\n\nDinner is another great option with various twists on their dishes. Buttermilk chicken with mashed potatoes & vegetables hits the mark pretty close for this southern raised boy! Only one suggestion...try homemade biscuits that aren't so dry, no matter how much butter you throw at them. Just a thought...\n\nOverall, our party was well taken care of on a busy night with the manager/owner even checking on guests to ensure they're enjoying themselves. Lil touches and new twists make this spot a good but unique place to grab a bite!"
1,OMG!! Best burgers joint I have found in Phx! Love that you can choose what eva style of fries that you want! I prefer the fat fries! This place is always on point and always leaves us satisfied. Best part when you leave em a tip. Dude screams out FAT TIP!!! We heart this place...
0,"09/11/14\nATTEMPTED RENTAL\n\nIf I could give them ZERO stars, I would.\n\nI have rented from Payless for years. Consistently, they've been fine.\n\nTODAY I arrived, having been driven and dropped off by my spouse, over 10 miles across Las Vegas Valley from my condo, to be told that they have a new corporate policy REQUIRING A PAYROLL STUB OR UTILITY BILL as proof of identity.\n\nWHAT?\n\nNever before have I needed either of these. MANY MANY rentals later.\n\nI had to go to Alamo and pay more.\n\nI will never rent from Payless again. \n\nAnd I will warn others to not do so."
0,"WOW. Went there for the first time Friday. Thought it was good until today when my friend sees they added 20$ onto his tab. Tipped the tender each time a drink was purchased. He has all the receipts and it was way less than what they charged him. So if you enjoy being robbed, this is the place for you! NEVER returning."
0,"While I know this applies to all stores and not just this one it's worth pointing out that the prices listed on Books-A-Million's own website are NOT the same as the prices in store and they will NOT price match their own website or other websites either. A book I recently went in to purchase was a whopping $25 more in store ($59 instead of $39). One of the empolyees bluntly informed me this was to help fund her paycheck. Sorry, I'll be helping someone at Amazon out with their paycheck instead."
1,"First carwash I've been to that vacuum the trunk. Very honest about the service. My car is super clean. Totally worth my $30, tip included.\nThis will be my carwash from now on. \nI'll bring my older black exterior car here next time for the real test."
1,Excellent Italian food and a huge wine collection.  Anytime you're in Charlotte downtown.  Stop in.  You won't be disappointed!
1,"My friends and I always start our trip to Vegas with this restaurant.  It has good food, a social crowd, and all you can drink wine.  That's right - all you can drink wine comes with the meals!\n\nHow could you not want to start off your stay in Vegas with a full belly and good, hard buzz?  And call me superstitious, but the drunken sports bets my buddies and I place after our meal always end up doing better than our sober bets...\n\nSo stop by, I recommend the Chicken Rio, and have some fun.  Oh, and if you spill some wine on the table, splash a nearby patron, and park yourself at the table for way-to-long, don't worry - it seems that everyone is used to it.  \nTrust me, I know from experience (my apologies Battista's)..."
1,"I had a lot of fun here, but I'm not really a clubby type person (why I went to Vegas, I don't know). We just ad to put our name on the list online and we got in within 15 minutes.\nThe place is full of little separate pools which sets a fun mood, but they are only open to people on certain days/nights. They had an open bar from 11pm-midnight which was lovely and the bartender was super quick about it and made sure to rotate around and serve everyone. There are  couple of bars and a dance area but most of it is just to lounge around and socialize which is nice. And the crowd that it draws is cool. Not a bunch of stuck ups, which is a plus.\n\nI do have to say it's a little over priced though. Over $50 for three drinks after open bar was over."
1,"Two words: Super Burrito. It may not be as big as your head, but its as big as your late night appetite.  I suggest the steak version without beans.  However, they're very accommodating, so have them throw in some chorizo if you're feeling wiley."
0,HORRID. I own a business and I do deposits daily. I have never seen a bank more understaffed. Clearly on pourpose because it's ALWAYS slow service. \n\n2 tellers for 15 ppl waiting while the other ppl in the office tap on their keyboard. Very frustrating place to do business with. The tellers are fine and that's the only reason it's not 1 star. The problem is getting to the tellers. Really BOFA u can't afford more help!!!!
1,"Tempe Marketplace is pretty great. There are a lot of good food options (and some laughably bad food options), a decent mix of stores and boutiques and a really nice movie theatre. I live close by so I'm around pretty often, whether it's to grab a quick bite, hit up the Target or do some shopping.\n\nIf you're expecting a mall, you'll be disappointed. It doesn't offer the department stores and options that a full fledged shopping mall does, but it has some options that you won't see at a mall (Best Buy, Pier 1, Old Navy, Cost Plus World Imports). \n\nThere are good fast and slow food options, including The Keg, Red Robin, Smashburger, Lucille's BBQ, CPK, Paradise Bakery and Chipotle. There are bad restaurants too, so there are places to avoid (Cadillac Ranch, Darcy McGee's). There's also a Dave and Busters if you have 3 hours to waste and want to play some games. \n\nIt's really nice to be able to park and walk around outside and shop when it's not too hot. You can also kill an entire day here if you want to, with lunch, shopping, a movie and then dinner. You've got options for stuff to do, and enough shopping to keep you happy."
1,Delicious food. I usually get the chicken  tikka masala with plain naan. Clean and casual. Small  quaint place to eat. Friendly staff. Good service.
1,"Always stop here for a bag each of candy-shelled chocolate-covered peanuts and chocolate-covered almonds from the bulk section.  Love the organic Mountain Fresh and Brown Cow yogurts.  As for the produce I buy here, I must first say that I triple-, sometimes quadruple-inspect my options before I purchase at any grocery I shop at, and I've only had to complain about the strawberries here at Sunflower.  All other fruits and the veggies were fine.  Wish I could say the same about the other farmer's market whose name rhymes with snouts...\n\nDon't know if this place still sells Berto's gelato and Laloo's goat milk ice cream as it's been close to a year since I last purchased, but you must check these items out as they taste out-of-this-world!  The prices are also very wallet-friendly compared to AJ's, but really, that goes without saying, doesn't it?"
1,"The show and venue are great. The performance balances well-orchestrated humor with talent. And it's delightfully random. \n\nFrom the moment he emerges, your eyes are glued to Moreno--great energy as a performer. I recommend!"
1,"One of my all time favorite burger joints! They do one thing, and they do it well! A very simple menu of just burgers, fries, shakes, & soda......period!\n\nI remember the very first time I ever walked into an In-N-Out............ordered me a hamburger, ate it............then thought..........\""is that it?\"" I was wondering what's the big deal? \nIt wasn't until one of my friends, who is an In-N-Out fanatic told me - \""NO\""..........anytime you go to an In-N-Out, you must always order the Double Double!!!\n\nSince that time...............whenever I'm on the mainland, and walk into a In-N-Out burger joint, I always order a Double Double! \n\nWhat can I say about the In-N-Out burger joint............\n\n1. I wished they would open one up in Hawaii.\n\n2. Food is cheap, only $3.20 for a Double Double, & very tasty too! Burgers are made to order on the spot, hot & fresh..........not like some other joints where they are microwaved & put under the heat lamp. \n\n3. A very simple menu. They just do burgers, fries, shakes, & soda..........keepin' it simple, & they do it well!\n\n4. Restaurant is very clean, and the service is EXCELLENT!\n\n5. Open fountain kept very clean...........McDonald's could learn a thing or to (hint: McCully McDonalds!).\n\nLots of free parking..........but the place is always crowded on matter what time you go there.........Ka CHING!\n\nI also heard from a friend to order the Double Double \""Animal Style\""...........don't know what this is...........I'll have to try it one day."
0,"Worst buffet ever made in vegas. Basically a rip off ($35 each), with just a straight line of selection. Food was not even that great, the only highlight was the steak, the creme brulee, and unlimited wine. But if you're at a buffet, you want various selection of food not just wine. \n\nI don't recommend this at all, especially if you're starving and they tell you that they're serving \""gourmet\"" food, most likely thats a lie."
0,"Horrible customer service and HORRIBLE time management.\n\nI came in this morning at 730 am, right when they opened. Only one other person here at the same time, he got here 2 mins before me. I ask for a basic oil change and tire rotation, so does the other guy. It takes them 15 mins just to get my paperwork ready and get my info. At 745am, the guy helping me says the car will be ready \""within 30 mins, 45 tops\"". It's 850 am and he's still working on the tire rotation, don't even think he's done the oil change yet. The guy who got here before me was in and out in 30 mins. There's 3 guys working here and I AM STILL WAITING FOR MY VEHICLE. Meanwhile, the guy I assume is the manager, has already taken 4 smoke breaks!!! Beyond angry. It's very simple, DO NOT QUOTE A TIME YOU CANNOT KEEP. Better yet, stop dicking around and do your job. There's 3 guys here, the shop was dead, it shouldn't take over an hour and a half to get a simple oil change and tire rotation. I am NEVER coming here again."
0,I own a property managed by Osselaer for the past 8 years now and the HOA managed areas appearance are in a state of decline while HOA fees increase every year.  \n\nMost recently I have gotten a stern weed warning even though my property has very little to no weeds and has more appeal than 80% of the other properties in the neighborhood.  \n\nI am not sure if its the lack of leadership in the HOA board or Osselaer to blame for poor pool contracting and weed fines but either way they are doing a poor job.  \n\nI would give them 1 star but have been happy that Karen typically returns my call within 24 hours.
0,"I feel badly about the two star review. Really, I do. I wanted to like this place. Really. \n\nWe were seated at 710 PM. It wasn't until 730 that we were even greeted by our server. I don't blame this on her- but rather on the overall disorganization of the place. \n\nThe drinks took forever, the first time and each subsequent order. Our appetizer was delicious- buffalo mozzarella with two Italian meats. 5 stars!  \n\nOur entrees were, overall, pretty good. I had the fried chicken with gnocchi. \n\nThe others I dined with enjoyed their meals as well. \n\nMy major disappointment was the menu- only five pasta options at an Italian restaurant.  \n\nMy advice: leave the steak to Capital Grille and make great pasta dishes."
0,"I don't know what was wrong 40 minutes waiting after we order and food never came, and waitress did not show up again neither. Of course we leave."
0,"Gimme some sugar, gimme some artificial tasting frosting and then gimme my tooth brush. \n\nSorry to be the buzz kill of the group, but I'm not loving what I had here. We ordered 3 different macarons, Nutella, Maple-Bacon and Late Night Snack. The first bite of each, all I could think of was how artificial it tasted. It tasted like someone had stuffed store bought cake frosting in between the macarons. I took a bite of each and couldn't finish any of them. \n\nThe rest of their dessert cake wasn't that appealing. They had inidividual size treats, like dirt cake and the such, but each costing around $6? Gimme (no pun intended) a break. Way overpriced on all of their desserts here. Would much rather spend my money and calories elsewhere."
0,Terrible.   When sushi smells fishy you know its not fresh. I hope I don't get food poisoning later since my stomach is upset already. Service was terrible also.   Maybe my expectations are too high dince I am Japanese and know good sushi.   Lucky for them there is not another sushi place in the area or they would be out of business.
1,Stingray is consistent in their terrific quality of food and drinks. M-F from 3-7 is a great happy hour. You can't expect things to come out in 5 minutes when the restaurant and bar are busy.  Relax and enjoy the atmosphere and music. Great people watching. Fantastic patio. Delicious drinks. Friendly (and pretty!) bartenders and servers.
0,"I don't even think this place deserves one star. We took our daughter's Ipod in here not once, not twice, but three times to get it repaired and it still isn't right. First the screen was put on incorrectly and it kept falling off. Next it was pinched down to hard so the buttons didn't work. Finally the screen kept coming off again. Now the wifi isn't working. We took it into another place this morning and learned Quick Mobile Repair CUT the wifi wire. Lovely, just lovely. Don't waste your $$$ here. We WILL BE getting our money back plus the cost of the new repairs. I can't believe how this place stays in business."
0,"If being pushed, shoved side to side, not dancing freely, waiting forever by the bar, having your feet stepped on, having people you had recently told  \""no thank you, but I don't want to dance with you\"" keep coming back to try to dance with you, having the same type of music play over and over, your idea of a good time...then this place is for you!\n\nTAO is truly one of the most overrated clubs in Vegas. It honestly is not what it tries to portray itself to be. Sure, it's lovely but that's probably it. Small and overcrowded dance floors are definitely a no go for a good time. I wonder why The Venetian ever allowed it to establish itself here. It's like it's partner, LAVO, it really is not one of the greatest spots in Vegas to go out dancing. \n\nThe good thing, for ladies, is that there is an open bar up until 10:30 pm! So, I would recommend to put yourself on the guest list, drink up, and then hit the next better clubs!"
0,"This place is a craphole. My friends and I have gone for a 2 AM breakfast a couple of times (I know that seems weird but it's cheaper than eating at the diner that caters the breakfast!) and the people working there are absolute dicks. The girl at the front door acts like she's the hottest thing since sliced bread. The girls that walk around are bit*hes unless you're throwing wads of money out. I jokingly told one of the girls that my friend wanted a lap dance and within 5 minutes he came back really mad. He said she danced and he handed her $30 and she said \""NO! It's $60!\""  That's crazy considering the girls don't even look very good! Maybe I'm biased because I'm not a strip club kind of guy but this place is a bad way to end a good night"
1,"I had a laser hair removel treatment from Tisha Sudah here.  She was AMAZING! \nShe took her time and I had no pain or discomfort at all, unlike other places/techs \nI have gone to.   I can't recommend her enough and the prices are very very reasonable.  Beats those other places that advertise just Laser Hair Removal and then give you a quote that is out of this world crazy expensive!   Thanks Tisha!"
0,"Good pastries, amazing crepes & sandwiches. HORRIBLE SERVICE! All of the cashiers/servers look like they're miserable. Like they don't want to be there. Is it too much to get a smile? They are rude & treat you like they want you to get the hell out of there. They'd rather be on their phones and lost in conversation with their \""regulars\"" than pay attention to customers. I'd choose okay food and great service over great food and okay (or in this case- horrible) service."
0,The food was at best mediocre and the service was slow even though it was completely empty.  Not recommended.  Masala Bay on Regina and Erb has much better Indian food.
0,"I remember coming here the first few days it had opened.  For a place that is called Pancit Adobo, you'd you'd think they'd at least get those two dishes right. Pancit and adobo are two signature Filipino dishes that you cannot mess up.  If you cannot master those two, I'm a bit hesitant on trying anything else.\n\nSo thank you, but no thank you..."
0,"A friend and I were traveling and wanted out first stopping point to be in Phoenix. We booked this place online. We had trouble checking into our room becaus we used her dads card (with his knowledge) and since he wasnt.there we had issues, but that was just the front desk guy doing his job. The only issue that bothered us was we were trying to figure this out and there was a drunk guy that wouldnt stop talking to all of us. The front desk guy knew we.were uncomfortable and was very discreet on all of our info. he even called and apologized, told us if we needed anything to call and there will be someone up there to answer. The room was decently cleaned and none of that bothered us. The bathroom got hot and stuff with.the light on and door closed and the sink knob was loose. Becausr we just used this room to shower, sleep, and eat a free breakfast the price was great. it is also located RIGHT next to walmart and a gas station. \n\nI recommend for a short cheap stay."
0,"Even though Los Tacos is one of my favorite taco stands in Las Vegas. I went there today at 8:10pm, waited at the drive thru menu for 10min. Thought maybe it was broke. Drove up to the window, 6 employees were standing behind the counter. I honked the horn several times and tried to waive them down. They ignored me like I didn't exist. This wasn't the first time I arrived before 9pm which is the time that's posted that they close and they closed early. They could of at least had the decency to tell me they were closed, don't ignore me when you know I'm there. Now I see why Tacos El Gordos next store remains busy. It's not just the quality of food, it's also the appreciation and respect of your loyal customers!"
0,"Very disappointed in this cultural district restaurant.  The portions were miniscule, overpriced, and of poor quality.  The quail was tough and the \""Seafood Risotto\"" consisted of 2 mussels, 2 small clams, a small, unidentifiable piece of fish served over a spoonful of too-salty risotto for $27!  There was no attempt at attractive presentation.  We left hungry with a $100 check.  It put a damper on the entire evening.  We won't be back."
0,Not sure what all the excitement is about here ... just a bunch of M&M branded junk.  Walked in and walked right back out.  LOL.
1,"Interesting menu. The wine was pretty affordable, the food was on the pricey side. I had the quinoa salad and pork tenderloin and grits. Both were excellent. Service was friendly."
1,"It's a buffet, so I'm going to be intentionally brief here. This is worth it - every time. The drive, the wait, the price - it's worth it. So, just go here if you're around and you have some time to pig out for a bit. King crab legs for dinner. Holler and a half."
0,"I had the serious DISPLEASURE of attempting to dine at La Cave in the Wynn Hotel, Las Vegas this evening. What a dark, miserable little dungeon run by trolls.\n\nI was seated by a very snotty, skank hostess who apparently had little interest in the answers to her canned hostess questions: Was I a guest here? No. How do I like staying at the hotel? Uhm, I'm not. Would I like a wine list? No, I'm not drinking tonight....still got the wine menu. Why even ask if you don't even care??? Robot in fishnet stockings that she was, I'm glad she got off her stripper pole at the gas station in North Vegas in time to come to work at La Cave and find me a wobbley little table. YIKES.\n\nAnyway, I was dining alone and sat at the table waiting for a waiter/waitress for well over 15 minutes without ANY service, water or otherwise. Waitstaff walked by constantly, still no service.\n\nSince I was on a tight schedule, I got up and tracked down a waitress in the kitchen area and politely explained to her what had happened and then handed her back my menus. No one cared and no one tried to remedy the situation.\n\nI wound up eating at another restaurant in the hotel, with great service. Sorry, La Cave. Your service was beyond rude, your hostess staff was dirty and I was happy to take my 40% tip elsewhere."
1,"Stayed here for four nights for my son's national mock trial championship so there were lots of teenagers. Even so the rooms seemed well insulated. Front desk and housekeeping service was very good. Rooms were nice and relatively large. A couple restaurants close by. Short walk to baseball and basketball venues as well as light rail.  I recommend light rail to/from airport as it is cheap. You will have to pull your bags a couple blocks though. Cab ride to airport is about $17 without tip. Area seemed safe. Mysteriously uncrowded even during the week. Really dead during the weekend and some businesses shut down completely. They charge for Internet which is never good. Overall, this is a nice business hotel that is very convenient to downtown attractions and light rail (which is quite nice)."
1,"We were walking on that area of the strip, looking for something asian, when we realize we needed something quick before our show. Then we found this place, kind of hidden. Okay price, but quite tasteful, plus, much quicker than a regular buffet place. They have the option to prepare the BBQ in the kitcken, good for lazy people like me, and who wants the meat done properly. So we were very satisfied. I think we'll visit here again next time."
0,"Wow, this has to be the worst service I have ever experienced at any restaurant, and I've been to places that no human being should ever set foot in, around the world.\n\nWe waited here for over 15 minutes, and not one person came to take our order.  That doesn't even happen in Manhattan!\n\nYou can see the workers here play favorites, though: I don't know if it was the the manager or just some worker running the show that day, but he had a long conversation in Hindi with some family with their kid, and then let them in and serve them....all the while pretending that we and some other patrons were not there.\n\nWhoever owns this place: this took place at lunch time on Veterans Day, 2013.  I think you need to fire or deport some people here.\n\nOne person who was really nice was the lady up front.  She was really kind and welcoming,  and it looked like she was angry at the servers for being slack, but they were disrespecting her.  It was sad to see.  \n\nThis place looks nice and has nice decor: but 15 minutes with no service?  Maybe they think they are in India, and patrons need to bribe the servers for service?  Seriously, do NOT go there if you are starving or on a date with someone you care about.  You will be utterly humiliated.  It's like that episode of \""Seinfeld\"" where they go to a Chinese Restaurant, but never get seated; the only difference is that you get seated, but then forgot about and left to die.  lol.\n\nWe just walked out and got great service at Mellow Mushroom a few doors down.  Great vegan pizza there.  We were visiting Charlotte and whenever we return, we won't be coming to the Blue Taj, which should be renamed the \""Ewww Taj.\"""
1,"Wasn't expecting much when I was looking at the front of the store, but when I walked inside I was blown away.  The coffee was great and fresh, sitting on top of a great atmosphere to blog, do HW, etc.  Definitely should try it if you have a chance!"
1,"DOSA!!!! that was the main reason we came to this place. I had a combo 2, that gave me the chance to try dosa and 3 more other things. Good service, nice place and friendly attention."
1,My wife and I recently spent our Honeymoon in Edinburgh and our dining experience at Castle Terrace was hands down the best dining experience we have EVER had. The service was impeccable and the food was amazing. We had ordered the food tasting with the wine pairing. It was out of this world! We were in the restaurant for over 4 hours we were having such a good time!\n\nI can not recommend this restaurant enough if you are looking to splurge and celebrate.
0,"Bottom line: ACCEPTABLE - stop here if you're on business and need an outlet.\n\nPros:\n-Quite a few seats with access to outlets\n-Good service\n\nCons:\n-Does not taste good; chicken was rubbery (I know it is airport food...still expected something slightly better)\n-No value, quality not nearly justified by price"
1,"I love that I found my go-to scottsdale spa!  Racheal does my hair (cut and highlights) and she is amazing, I wouldn't go anywhere or to anyone else.  I love that they have a ton of amenities (including a small pool!) so everytime I go, I can spend as much time as I want there.  They offer small snacks and tea/water and the staff is just so friendly and inviting.  Definitely would recommend Spa Lamar to anyone looking for a relaxing, enjoyable  spa day. Two thumbs up!!"
0,"Get your act together Gold's! I've been a member since last year. Came in for a spin class with a lot of broken bikes. When I walked out in the middle of class twice to ask the staff to have maintenance come adjust one of the bikes so the seat wouldn't buck back and forth (very dangerous and hazardous), they all looked like deers in headlights and no one knew what a Phillips head screwdriver was. I even walked out to my car to see if I had one so I could adjust it myself since apparently no one wanted to help.\nIn a full class such as cyclone, you don't have any choice of bikes if you can't move around.\nIt's bad enough when a couple month's ago, the old guy that works there (the one with the dyed hair)  interrupts class with yelling into the class and watches like a pervert to see the women doing their floor exercises. Inappropriate.\nFix your damn machines and train your staff to know how to handle basic issues! Also, get you website and app working. This is not how you should run a business."
0,"Massive Japanese buffet... Big selection, affordable... Just not very good...\n\nThe miso soup is really bland and, I think a few times I had it, they ran out of the miso... So I just ended up getting warm water...  The hot food ranges from bad to mediocre. The sushi - I'm afraid of eating buffet sushi... I've heard of too many horror stories about people getting sick from it - But, I hear that it's OK here... Nothing special... Maybe a little too much rice, but it's supposed to be fresh\n\nService is fast and efficient.  I wouldn't say that the staff is friendly... But it's not rude...\n\nThe giant octopus sculpture thing is amazing though.  +1 star for that alone."
1,"No, you're not going to find any taco specials here. But yes, you can get your polished $20 tacos and eat it in a swank dining room. \n\nHate to say it, but my expectations going in were pretty low. The chatter on Javier's was  \""over-priced\"" \""not worth it\"" \""underwhelming\"" \""not real Mexican food.\"" How else was I to feel? After eating there not just once but three times, I'm happy to say that Javier's isn't so bad.\n\nMy Mexican friends are gonna kill me, but I actually like the food here! The selection isn't unique. You've got your usual meats, tacos, enchiladas, etc. Ingredients and recipes aren't creative masterpieces but the menu is easy to navigate and won't confuse you. The food tastes cleaner here--which can be expected. Meats and other ingredients are of a higher calibre and it really shows in the flavor. I can vouch for the Carne Tampique\u00f1a and the Cabo Azul. And since everyone's #1 question is \""is the Carne Asada worth it\""... No, it isn't. Not to say it isn't delicious but like kobe beef, I'm 99.9% sure its a gimmick to add intrigue. It worked on 2 of my friends so far!\n\nTotal date spot for sure. Its got the expensive, swanky feel without being overdone. The dark woods and leathers add to the luxurious ambiance but still make it warm and comfortable. The bar is under this massive rope chandelier and be sure to check out the world's largest chainsaw sculpture. It's actually pretty cool.\n\nService is up to fine-dining expectations and the bartenders are excellent. They've got a huge selection of tequila bordering the lines of ridiculousness. Some of them go up to $2,000. Of the ones I've tried, I highly recommend the Clase Azul. Sweet, smooth, and relatively reasonably priced at $20. I don't usually get mixed drinks, but they make a mean margarita. They run around $17 (if i remember correctly). I had one with cucumber and lime which was nice & refreshing."
1,"Stopped in for lunch with M.  I got the Mahi Mahi Quesa (Oaxaca cheese, mahi mahi fish, poblano pepper, mushrooms, onion, fresh garlic and Mexican herbs) and a large rasberry lemonade.  I asked if I can have the quesa without pepper (not a big fan), they said ok.  But it still came with it.  The quesa was HUGE!  It was really good.  The total came to $10.27, a little more $$ than I thought it should be."
0,"Alright, I know this place is a local legend. I want to give it a higher rating, I really do. But Eddie's place was a big \""meh\"" in my book.\n\nFirst of all, it's trying to accomplish wayyyyy to much. Is it a southern comfort place? A breakfast place? Eclectic American? Bar food? Deli? And why the shit are there potstickers on the menu?\n\nAs for the food, I ordered the shrimp and cheese grits, which were very good. Possibly the mildest grits I'd ever had. It came with a salad that was substantial and included bacon. So far, so good. Some friends ordered the she-crab soup, which was tasty, especially with a bit of sherry.\n\nHowever, a friend ordered the potato skins, which were completely lacking for flavor. Couldn't taste cheese, potato, or even sour cream. Just grease and carbs. Another friend ordered the reuben. It did not look good: greasy, with far too little meat.\n\nThe service was friendly, but bumbling. First, the potato skins came out as potstickers. Strike one. Then they added $1.50 to my tab because I asked for spinach in my salad. Seriously? First of all, spinach is not that fucking expensive. And secondly, you couldn't even put that in the fucking menu? Or explain to me that it cost extra? I call bullshit. Bullshit x1000.\n\nPrices were high for the food they were serving. Needed to be about 20% less.\n\nThe place loaded up with people as we finished our meal, so we got out of there quickly to make way for the next party. I wanted to shake some of them on the way out and shout, \""Why are you wasting your money here?! Go someplace where you can get consistent food with competent waitstaff!\""\n\nSo, I dunno. Not my cup of tea. Maybe if you can stand dumb servers and you can distinguish between what is good and what isn't on the menu, you'll have a better time."
0,"Montreal is a great and vibrant city but PET Airport is cramped, dated, dark, and congested.  Its too bad that everyone gave up on Mirabel Airport."
1,"I'd be VERY Leery of Single-Visit, Single-Review yelps.\n\nAs an Ex-Local, Brian's Beach was and still is one of our favorite Japanese restaurants in LV.  How much do we like it?  Let's see on a recent URGENT trip to LV where we had to drive over in the morning and leave in the afternoon, the ONE place that we had to make time for in that highly compressed time frame was Brian's Beach.\n\nThe service has always been exemplary, the food has always been excellent.  Our favorites include, the seared tuna tartar, Dynamite, the grape and bree quesadilla (WTF? uhh yeah, MUST TRY) and their assorted rolls and appetizers\n\nOne great bonus about this place is that the AYCE rules aren't limited to just the rolls, but also apply to the appetizers, so if you have someone with you that doesn't dig rolls, they can stick to the great appetizer menu\n\nThe ONE thing that I personally dislike is that the Seared Tuna tartar is limited to one order per guest.  - I can't blame them for that though, it's an expensive dish and I would seriously just chow down on a dozen plates of that if I could."
0,"Decent daily HH, but food quality was lower and prices higher than expected. Service was dismal at best. Convenient to my 'hood but can't see myself returning, not sure how they have so many locations unless this was out of the norm for them.\n\nOne waitress for whole place, but only three tables. Still barely saw her and had a mistake on our order. It was fixed and she was polite but not particularly attentive. When not serving she was seated at the bar watching a screen and drinking from a mug, maybe she wasn't feeling well.\n\nMenu describes wings using the word \""giant\"" but I found them quite small- one in the bucket was literally the size of my car key. Medium buffalo sauce was spot-on, regular and curly fries are both tasty. Standard bar fare, really.\nWebsite menu lists a November special of soup and sandwich, but those specials were nowhere to be seen on in-store materials. Luckily they still had it, because the potato soup is actually really, really good!"
1,"Went to Sunday brunch at the feast buffet. They are not serving crab legs on the buffet in Dec,that doesn't  bother me I don't really eat crab legs at buffets to messy for me.   \n     The good thing about this was they charge less about $12 per person. The quality is pretty good too. Everthing I ate on the the Chinese station was tasty and fresh.   The menudo soup was very good , better then most Mexican restaurants in town, for some reason I always have to season my menudo soup at Mexican restaurants not here. The prime rib was good quality not like some other buffets where they went too a cheaper off tasting product. I can't explain it , but I know it when I taste it.   \n           I saved the best for last, the bread pudding is one of the best or the best I ever had.  When they first opened I fell in love w/ this bread pudding, There was a time I would crave it .  It is crusty on top and very moist at the bottom, it is very custard like , they also have a creme anglais( thin vanilla custard sauce) that u can put on it to make it even better. \n           Very glad that the quality has not gone down like some other station  casino buffets."
1,"Soups are all amazing .. Fresh daily from the father; sandwiches, salads and pastries from the mother to die for .. Nothing but great food from a family owned and operated business .. Tuna sandwich and cream of cauliflower soup and croissant are FAVs. Olivier could not be a more welcoming host!"
0,"OMG, this Holt is horrible ! When you're used to the Bay-Bloor one in Toronto, this one looks like a grocery store !!\nThe selection is pretty small and actually not really good either... Example; my boryfriend went there to buy a pair of Tod's shoes, they only carried 3 pairs... 3 pairs !!!! Nothing !!! \nWe waited 15 min to have a snoby, rude saleswomen finally serving us... Of course, we didn't buy anything and will not spend any penny in that Holt Renfrew, better wait and go to Toronto or in France...."
1,"I took my parents. They both seemed to like it. My mother raved about her entr\u00e9e, which I believe was beef fried rice. She also enjoyed the fried pot-stickers, though they weren't all that thoroughly fried (obviously steamed and then quickly \""fried\"" on one side). I wasn't too hungry and just had the crispy tofu, which was excellent as many others have said. Held up well the next day for lunch, too.\n\nWe ordered a mix of things from the translated menu and the \""American\"" menu. \n\nI didn't find the order process to be complex even as a first-timer. Grab a menu, find what you want, write it on a piece of paper, go up to the counter. Not rocket science. We grabbed a table first which made things a bit easier."
1,"As impressive a structural marvel as you could hope to see, The Forth Road Bridge serves a purely practical purpose but due to it's scale, history, and ubiquity with all things Scotch, is also a tourist attraction in itself. It's made all the more impressive and imposing by the neighbouring Forth Road Bridge which runs parallel.\n\nGiven that the vast majority of Scotland's population lives in the central belt, surprisingly few, including myself, have had the pleasure of actually crossing the rail bridge, and it's something I really need to get off my arse and do sooner rather or later. I just need a reason to travel to either Fife, Tayside or the North East, which unsurprisingly isn't the easiest thing to come across. I might one day just spend a fiver on a return to the grim little village of Inverkeithing which is right after the bridge. It would be worth it for the experience alone.\n\nUtterly stunning, but I'll be a bit controversial here and declare that The Tay Bridge, with it's sweeping bend and dark history, just nicks it for me as Scotland's number 1 river crossing. Take the Edinburgh to Dundee train and you'll cross both."
1,AWESOME!  Excellent prices and delicious food. I ordered Mongolian Beef minus mushrooms- my meal was superb. Best Mongolian beef I've ever had! The owner was friendly and talkative. I'll be eating here again next time I'm in Madison.
1,"Great hidden spot in Las Vegas!  I come from a Korean and Mexican background so this place was perfect for me.  The Bulgogi, marinated beef, burrito is a all time great and is an automatic go to dish for around $5 and can usually feed you for two meals.  Another recommended item is the Daegi bulgogi, spicy pork, french fries. \n\n For those of you that have hit Robertos Tacos late night and enjoyed their super carne asada fries you will love these.  They step it up every week with new specials such as calamari tacos and bulgogi gyros so you never get bored with the menu.  The Korean street tacos blend the tastyness of Korean meats with the ease  of tacos, I recommend ordering a few at the low price of $1.29.  I could go on forever on the best items on the menu so head over and decide for yourself.\n\nIf you have friends that aren't too adventurous or little kids Komex can handle that too.  They offer sliders, french fries and other basics that are just as good.  Because this place is so good and really affordable it can get busy around peak times so don't get frustrated and recognize that if there are tons of people eating there then it must be good."
1,"So so yummy.  I had the tostadas con pollo on my first visit and was amazed at the huge portion I received.  It was just supposed to be a snack but it ended up being quite a lot of stuff piled onto a perfectly crispy little tostada.\n\nThe next time I went, I had the tacos de ribeye.  Really amazing little tacos, perfectly cooked meat, and great toppings.  It's hard to find stuff this good and this cheap that has consistency and cleanliness, freshness of ingredients, and great personality.  ESPECIALLY out in the suburbs."
1,Love love love their Napoleon sheet cake. Best I've found in charlotte. It's quite large wish it was a bit smaller. For calorie purpose. Everything is quite pricey but worth it. Also tried the macaroons relish. Also a nice place to hang well if we didn't have the kids.
0,"I brought my dog here thinking it would be a better experience then at Petsmart but when I walked in, I already had a bad vibe and wish I would have just stuck to my gut instinct. When I picked him up, his nails were bleeding and I wasn't informed that he was bleeding. I didn't notice until we got home and there was blood all over the carpet and couch. His haircut looked super uneven and it was only $10 cheaper than Petsmart. I definitely recommend just spending the extra money and taking your animal to a place where you know they will take care of your dog as if he is their own. I wouldn't mind the bleeding so much if they had informed me and maybe apologized but nope...nothing."
1,Just Spoke with the New Owner's who by the way are extremely nice and was told that they will reopen December 19th 2011. As far as I'm concerned the best Beef in the Valley. There will be new menu items such as Gourmet Salads & Wraps. Be sure to stop in once they reopen.
1,"I've been to a lot of places in the Phoenix area, and this is the best overall value you can get. Tons of TVs, horse races, great food, great drinks, all at very reasonable prices. I was impressed, not only with the taste of the food, but with the presentation as well. Love this place.\n\nThe bar tenders are attentive, receptive, and personable, without being overbearing. This has become a weekly spot for my wife and I to visit, and one which we look forward to spending our money at."
0,"Overrated.\n\nI went with some friends on a Saturday night. They let in the people with tables and passes first, then any girls waiting in line started to get let in at 10 pm. Our group split up. \n\nIt was pretty much empty in the club, just a few girls and some old dudes who had bought tables. \n\nAn hour later (at 11), they still weren't letting any guys in. We waited a little longer, then got annoyed and left.\n\nThis club creates artificial lines just so they can look more exclusive. Lame.\n\nOh yeah, and the drinks I bought ($20/apiece) were poorly made. I shouldn't have left a tip."
1,"I stopped into this location a few weeks ago because I heard that my company had negotiated a better discount for employees and, obviously, I wanted to get it. They weren't busy, so I was helped immediately. When I told the salesperson my situation I proceeded to get all of the paperwork out to verify my employment. He told me to put it all away because he had everything he needed already and that he'd look through some different options to make sure I was getting the best discount. After just a few minutes he had everything sorted out, told me I was going to save an additional 10% off of my bill and sent me on my way. He did actually point me toward accessories before I left, but he prefaced it by telling me that my company gets a sweet discount on them. I declined and he thanked me for using Verizon and told me to have a good day. It was a refreshing experience, seeing that so many cell-phone stores are trying to hard-sell everybody on everything. I'll definitely be back to this location!"
0,"My food experience was just so strange and terrible at the same time. The breadsticks reminded me of Fazoli's.  Anyone remember that place?  Remember the breadsticks?  Ya, they were stale, dry, and overly absorbent of the saliva inside my mouth.  They were not, however, rock hard, so I consider the breadsticks a wash.  \nThe salad was heavy on the onions, easy on the ANYTHING ELSE.  I've never seen an onion salad before but I would imagine that Olive Garden could make one without much extra effort.  I don't understand why they don't do dressing either.  Maybe they do and there was just too little on it, but the salad was dry.  So the salad was a fail.  \nFor the soup, I went with the Chicken & Gnocchi.  By chicken they mean \""chicken broth\"" and by gnocchi they mean \""ball of flour dough\"".  This was more like wanton soup than anything else.  It didn't taste horrible, just cheap...so only a minor fail.  \nI'm still alive, so I did better than I expected.  I figured the worst thing that could happen would be if I got horribly sick and had to take paid time off for a week...that didn't happen either...so another fail.\n\nThe whole experience is what got me.  We show up to GhettroCentre with 6 people and there are at least 20 waiting around for tables.  That's fine, it is lunch time.  We got a table and our waitress was decent enough.  Group ordered some sort of appetizers (that I did not partake of).  They brought our drinks.  We ordered our meals.  They brought our salads and breadsticks.  Then they brought us one of the apps.  About 10 minutes later she comes by to check on us...and we tell her we still don't have the other app.  She disappears for a while and comes back and says \""we ran out of chicken so it's going to be a while\""... wait what?  You ran out...but you will...what?  Clone some more?  Sub something else?  What are you doing to make more chicken appear?  We decline the app since our meals are arriving any minute.  Food arrives, everything is normal, whatever.  I was only mildly distracted by the weird outdoor christmas light strings they have draped throughout the dining room.  I survived.\n\nMy question is, my soup/salad/breadstick combo was like $6.99.  Everyone else's meals come with salad and breadsticks, right?  So I could have just ordered the $5.34 soup (seriously, that is expensive soup) and noshed on salad and breadsticks without paying for them?  Right?  What is up with that?"
1,"They know how to treat you here.  Everything is top-notch. Excellent martinis, steaks, and sides (generous enough to share with several people).  For our special occasion, they threw in free desserts."
1,"its more than a casino and hotel. they have shops and restaurants inside, and club pure. serendipity is conveniently located right outside the building, so you can go downstairs and get some frozen hot chocolate!\nthe hotel is really nice inside; very spacious and classy looking. they have very comfortable mattresses and pillows so its easy to fall asleep and not miss home! pool area looks pretty too."
1,"The fella and I live near the Fort Mill location, but we're so glad they moved to Charlotte! There's so much more room at this location, and now I can actually see the menu.\n\nWe arrived 30 minutes before our Open Table reservation to have a drink at the bar, which is long and spacious and seats about 12 people; there were also a couple of high-top tables near the front window. They had all local beers on tap, but I started with the bartender's recommendation of a Fig Manhattan (cold, bourbon-y, and yummy), and the fella went straight for a Blanton's neat. Bless the bartender's heart, you could hardly see the bourbon in his glass since the pour was so tiny... the fella was not impressed and grumbled a little bit through the beginning of dinner. \n\nWe moved onto the dining room behind the bar (there's also another one to the side of the bar), and it turns out they can curtain off any of the rooms for private parties. There's also another room upstairs for that specific reason, and there's a glassed-off chef's table that looks into the kitchen and appeared to seat about 10 people. The atmosphere of the entire restaurant/bar is dark and cozy with warm lighting and dark brown wood - perfect for a winter night. Although the atmosphere is intimate and upscale, we still felt totally comfortable in jeans, which I appreciate.\n\nOur waitress, Esther, was incredibly knowledgeable about the menu and had definite recommendations when we'd need a judge's ruling. We started with the pork belly (delicious), and then I got the pork of the day as my entree, and the fella got the short ribs. Thankfully, the chef prepared my pork medium rare, so it was incredibly tender, but I think the fella may have won the night since his short ribs were delicious, and his mashed potatoes were \""like crack.\""\n\nThe staff was full of nervous excitement and chattiness, and I'm guessing that'll calm down a little once they hit a groove, but I appreciated the enthusiasm... now they just need to work on their pours. Overall, a great addition to the Elizabeth food scene!"
0,"The management is terrible and the owner is rude and unaccomodating..not really authentic Filipino food..just authentic Filipino workers...i prefer to go to Barkada's on Decatur and Sahara...main chef now works there, way better and atmosphere is always great"
1,"Stayed here last weekend. Friendly staff. Two of my colleagues needed to change rooms (one because of noisy proximity to the elevator and ice machine, and one because the internet connection in his room didn't work), and they were able to do so with no fuss. My room was fine. AC worked great, and it was a quiet place to stay."
1,"Went to BLT Burger with my mom when she came to Vegas to visit and we stayed at The Mirage. We decided to go here because we didn't feel like going to far for dinner because we were both really hungry. We decided to try out BLT Burger since it was something casual and easy. We waited in line for about twenty minutes, but it was dinner time, so I really wasn't that surprised. The restaurant has a nice environment and is decorated in a simple way. The service was okay, but the food was really good. I had the Wagyu burger with Oregon Cheddar (no bun) with fries. I can't remember which burger my mom decided to have. The burger was $17; I don't remember how much the fries were. I really don't think that it was that expensive. Most burgers on the strip are about $15, so I'm not going to complain about the price."
0,"I don't really get it. I know some people love the food here.  But I've eaten here 4/5 times now and the food is 3 star quality.  The bread doesn't taste good or fresh to me, and bread is the most important part of a quality sandwich imho.  The ingredients were good, but the dirty floors and dingy atmosphere turn me off, and I like some dingy places.  \n\nThe pot theme runs strong and I wouldn't be surprised if most of the staff is high most of the time.  \n\nThe grossest thing about this place is the grooming of the staff.  I'm not really a judgmental guy, but is it too much to ask that people at least appear to have showered this week if they are preparing my food?? I don't like my food prepared by a fat greasy lady in a shirt that shows her hairy sweaty belly.  And I'm a guy who never trusts a skinny cook :) \n\nTotally hard to eat after watching someone like that prepare my food.  Not to mention the guys with the filthy dreadlocks and yesterdays food covered beard.  \n\nI do have to mention that they rice crispy treat with peanut butter puffs and cinnamon toast crunch was fantastic though.  Stick with the munchies at this post 420 retreat."
1,"I make a stop at  Bachi Burger whenever I am in Vegas, even when it's a matter of hours and not days. I am still in love  with the Pork Belly Steamed Buns, but my go- to burger lately has been the Ronin. They renovated the inside and it looks great, much more inviting. The drinks are always interesting and delicious, it's never the standard fare here. I really appreciate that, because who wants to pay for a meal that they can make at home? I can make a cheeseburger, however an Angus Beef burger patty with Caramelized Onions, Japanese Cole Slaw, Miso Goma Dressing, Fried Egg, Katsu BBQ, and Yuzu Citrus Aioli is not as easily done. So the Ronin is a delicious meal that I highly recommend. I always leave Bachi Burger full and happy."
0,"I came here to pick up a part that I had previously called on to be put on hold.  The associate found my part after a few minutes.  He double-checked that the part ordered actually fit my car, which was a plus.  I then requested another part, which they didn't have in stock.  The associate didn't offer to look at other stores so I had to ask myself.  \""Do any of your store's have it in stock?\""  After checking the system, he found what I needed at  another Auto Zone about 15 miles away.  He told me he could order the part and it would be in the next day, but I told him I didn't mind driving there and picking it up myself.  I asked if he could call the store to verify that they indeed had the part I needed and if they could put it on hold for me.  He took down my information and told me he'd call immediately.  \n  Upon arrival to the other Auto Zone, they found no record of the part I needed.  The associate even showed me the computer screen and that it didn't have my name or request anywhere, which means no one called to place the order.  So instead of just walking in and picking up my part, I had to go through the whole process again in order to find the correct part number necessary for what I needed.  It took longer than it should of because the associate didn't put it on hold like he told he me would.  Thank goodness the part was there and it all worked out in the end.  Will I come here again?  Most likely, especially if they have the part I need.  Don't come expecting some awesome customer service though.  \n\nPros:\n *  Associate double-checked my part to assure proper fitment\n *  Auto Zone offers holding items and delivery to your store of choice\n *  Nice little clearance section in front with little trinkets (air freshners,  key chains, and a bag of rags perfect for cleaning your car).\n\nCons:\n *  They didn't offer to call other store... I had to ask.\n *  Told me they would call store to hold item, but failed to do so.\n *  bad customer service \n\nOverall:\n *  I'll come here if they have the part that I need, otherwise; I'd rather go to another Auto Zone.  Compared to other stores, this Auto Zone rates as a mediocre when it comes to customer service.\n\nTips:\n *  Ask about the Auto Zone card\n *  Battery Charge (1 hour) freee\n *  Free Resurfacing of rotors\n *  Free Alternator testing"
1,Just went in for a quick shave. Jimmy was quick and on point... Staff in there was amazing. It is an amazing establishment close to home. I will definitely keep going there Thank You for the first shave Jimmy... Much respect cheers pal...
0,"Went to Giorgio's for a family reunion type lunch- there were 12 people, and understandably, larger parties take longer to serve....however, Giorgio's took an unbelievably long time for the food to come out to us. Not only did it take long, they brought out meals for 6 us, while the other 6 had to sit and wait another 30 minutes to receive their food. There is no excuse for this. \nWaitresses and staff were nice and polite and were apologetic (they blamed the cooks). However, nothing was compensated for the horrible experience we had there. And it took another 30 minutes to get the check.....who do they have to blame here? \n\nFood was alright... Descriptions of the menu items not available in English so it was VERY unclear on what the dishes actually contained. Had some unsatisfied family members on meals they expected and what they actually received. Prices very high for what the food. ($16 for a Caesar salad?!) \n\nWe will NOT be returning to Giorgio's and I hope you will plan at least 2 hours if you plan to go there to eat...."
0,"Not to happy with these hotels, they want to charge for everything, including certain areas of the pool.  Don't come in June seems to be college students and young adults.  Annoyed with pool area they don't have enough recliners for the guests.  Can be in the pool during the day.  We werent loving our room in the pyramid, only 1 elevator and have to walk clearly around the building to get to our room, they were accommating when we requested a room in the towers!"
1,"Talk about a special occasion.  At deseos prices, we won't be back unless we win the lottery.\nThe food and service were excellent. Another plus? When so many other restaurants have tv's to distract you, you won't find any distractions here.\nWe were recommended to try the shrimp chicharonnes. It was a textural wonderland. Crunchy sweet, but creamy spice with slivered jalape\u00f1os. \nBoth my wife and I had the sea bass (not Chilean btw). Mine came with 2 large delicately cooked filets, skin on, and buttery delicious. \nWe rounded out the meal with the cigar desert and it lived up to its status.\n\nWe left feeling extremely full and satisfied. This was definitely a splurge for us, as it is not amenable on a middle class budget to eat here regularly. But service, food, and ambiance was worth it for a special occasion."
1,"There's a man who comes there every night for dinner and tells customers that if they don't like the food he'll pay for it. He hasn't had to pay for someone else food in 17 years!\n\nGreat food, generous portions, friendly people."
1,"This has been my favorite club by far in Vegas. Granted, I am NOT a club person. i usually get claustrophobic and run out. But this one was awesome.\n\n The music is excellent. I didn't get to wonder around the whole club but the VIP area was awesome and the drinks were way cheaper than Rain's VIP section. It was a little hot in there though. Lisa and I posted it by the bar the whole night and drank purple hooters till our legs started to move.\n\nThe music variation was impeccable, from rock, to rap to alternative to eighties to classic rock. Not just your run of the mill dance music. This club wants you to sing as well."
1,I wasn't sure what to expect when I got there as I have been to some pretty cheesy shows in Vegas. The tickets were reasonably priced and the theater was comfortable.  The seats are FAT FRIENDLY and it's cool (not hot)! The first act was hella funny and did some amazing juggling and balancing tricks.  VERY entertaining.  The burlesque was an interesting way to break up the show... I liked it.  2nd and 3rd acts were hiarious too!  Overall GREAT show!  I laughed so hard I had tears rolling down my face!  This is definitely a MUST see!!
0,Decent place but was disappointed. Expected belly dancers and Arabic music...Crowd was also very less...Hookah was ok not great...
0,I was not that impressed. I appreciate that they were open 24 hours and they were friendly. However they didn't want to prescribe anything because they wanted me to see my regular vet. So basically I paid $140 bucks for a supplement with the instructions to go to my regular vet in the morning and spend another $140 bucks.\n\nI went there with a cat that couldn't stop sneezing had labored breathing and was showing a third eye. \n\nI was under the impression because they are the backup for my vet and they worked together. They do not work with your vet. They are basically a urgent care. \n\nBy the time I got in there and waited my cat had calmed down so even though they agreed she needs additional antibiotic they sent me home with a supplement. I couldn't even find out what her temp was. If your pet can wait go to your regular vet.
1,"There was a little confusion getting a table. We were quoted one price but put at a table where they couldn't honor that price.  \n\nThey put us in VIP tables instead of regular tables because we are, as the manager puts it, \""very good looking and I would like you up front because you add to the sexy dynamic of the club.\""  Yes, flattery will get you everywhere. \n\n We bought a bottle in VIP, the manager apologized for the confusion and reduced the bottle minimum to only one.  Our personal server was on top of everything.  If my drink was half empty she promptly came over and asked if I needed a topper.  \n\nThe security was very pleasant and helped the girls on and off the upper wall so they could dance safely.  That is a huge plus to me.  They even walked us to the bathrooms and offered to go \""fishing\"" for us.  For the record I have never \""ordered\"" girls before so it was kinda awesome and very weird.   \n\nEduardo,  the manager promised to make sure we had a good time and to make sure we felt like our money was well spent.  He went above and beyond.  Cheers to all the workers at Haze for making our VIP visit actually feel like VIP.   It gets better.  A few weeks later I got an email from Ashley, our server at Haze (we exchanged cards) and she actually emailed.   The email thanked us for our business and once again apologized for the confusion.  She gave me her and Eduardo's contact info and invited me back next time I was in town.  \n\nFor my money you can't buy better service than what we received at Haze.  I will most certainly be going back"
0,"I have avoided this place for a long time because of price.  I always go to Hot Dog Heaven because they have the best prices on this side of town and they are always consistent.  \n\nBUT this review is not about them...I decided to try this place again last night and was very disappointed.  The service was good but here were the issues:\n\n1. Biggest issue, I was told I could not just order a hot dog by itself.  I wanted just 2 dogs by themselves.  I was FORCED to either get 2 dogs with fries or 2 dogs with a drink at a cost of over $9.00\n\n2.  The buns were not kept in a warmer so they were cold and the pickle was so cold it made the dogs cold.\n\n3.  Very little seaseme seeds only on top so the buns are not the same as a traditional dog.\n\nAt Hot Dog Heaven which I will go to today, you can get a dog for about $2.75 without being forced to purchase anything else.  At the place above I was told that a hot dog with fries which is close to $6.00 that the only thing he can do is take .50 off which still makes a dog twice as much as a dog at hot dog heaven.\n\nBeing from Chicago I really wanted this place to be successful because it is close to where I live but over the years, the prices keep going up and the frills keep going down....sorry but never again for me at this place..."
1,"This place is always packed sun, rain or snow, and rightly so, it's worth the wait and the trip to Montreal if you don't live there. \n\nIf you are going to order, you have to get the Fatty as the juices from the fat add an explosion of flavor in your mouth. \n\nI'm not even a fan of New York Style Reuben deli sandwiches but this is not a NY Deli sandwich, it's in a league of it's own."
0,"Blynk used to be the embodiment of healthy, organic eating.  Unfortunately, over the last few months, the food quality - and availabilty - has decreased.  Since the beginning of the year, I've been trying to eat healthier, and have increased my visits to Blynk accordingly.  On a nearly weekly basis, I hear someone say \""oh, you don't have [insert XYZ item] today?\""  Sometimes it's soups (none of the usually 3 varieties today), sometimes it's chips or bread to accompany the soup, sometimes it's salad toppings (I heard someone say they were out of beets & feta - plus more? - today) or dressings, sometimes it's the yogurt or beverage options that are stored in the refrigerator shelving.  I don't know who's in charge of their inventory management - perhaps no one? - but it's become a consistent problem.  Additionally, the quality of what they do offer has also decreased.  There are some definite challenges they need to quickly address to continue to thrive, but I'm hopeful they can fix them in the blynk of an eye."
1,"I have been in this shop several times and always with such great service. Today I bought a new bike and again the service was awesome. Very knowledgeable and honest.  Salesman didn't try to upsell me. When I came to pick up the bike, the young men that helped me was absolutely friendly and great to deal with. He took the time to watch me ride, got my seat set, put new pedals on and got me set up with a great front and rear light set. I highly recommend this shop!"
1,"A tad pricey, but the quality of food is worth it.  The steak kabob was tender and cooked perfectly medium rare.  However, the ground meat kabob such as the ground chicken kabob, you get twice as much meat for the price, but the spices that are used are good."

0,"We drive by this strip mall frequently so thought we'd try Tosinos.  Completely forgettable, average food that tastes like it might have been frozen.  We won't be back.  I recommend you drive up Power to McKillips and eat at Senior Tacos instead."
0,"Well if you don't want service or are not in any rush  this place is for you. \n\nIt took over 10mins just for her to come to our table to say she would be right with us.  \n\nOnce she came over for drinks and I asked if they had a specific vodka she left,  served 5 tables and returned with the answer 10 mins later.  \n\nThe happy hour is fine its a nice 2 for 1 deal on all drinks 4-7 and 9-close but with the service your lucky to get one drink in an hr.  \n\nMy husband and I ordered the beet salad and after eating it we realized they forgot to add the goat cheese to our salads.  The salad was good or it was that were were starting from waiting 45mins for food.  \n\nYou can use your total rewards card here for a discount.\n\nWe will not be coming back due to slow service."
1,I just wanted to add my personal wonderful food and drink experience. \nI went for Brunch on Saturday with my husband and we are now fans of this place. There was nothing at all to say bad about FEZ.\n\nI had the eggs benedict and a Bellini and was in heaven with every bite and every sip!! The husband had the breakfast kisra and was moaning with happiness after every bite...I tasted it too and will try this for my next brunch visit. My husband had a Bellini as well and also had a honeydew melon margarita and both were divine!!\n\nOur server  was super cute and very sweet during our visit..he also was helpful with suggestions on what to order and also enlightened up on the happy hour specials.\n\nI will be back very soon and you have not tried FEZ you are missing out on a great experience.
0,"Will was my salesman, and it was the worst experience of my life.  I understand there will be \""snags\"", however there were way too many snags.  It was the worse customer service I have ever received, and actually I am still waiting for resolution on some things.  I started this process in April, and am still not done.  I will never recommend this store to anyone."
0,"Let me start by saying that to get 1 star from me is hard.  I will give anyone a chance (or 2, off nights happen to the best of us), but I have never been so disappointed  in Mexican food as I was last night.  And this was not the first time I've been to Los Olivos.  We were regulars for a very long time (even organizing office Christmas parties there), but the quality of the food, the taste of the food, the service and the employees dedication has taken a severe nose dive over the last few years.  But having not been in about 2 years I stupidly thought I would give it another chance with the hopes that changes in staff and time would have made the experience better.\n\nFor a restaurant THAT close to a spring training facility, they should be striving to be the best and attract the clientele that will come back year after year. Word of mouth is key in Scottsdale to keeping a business going.  You can have a flashy restaurant, fancy chef, but if the food and service sucks, no one will go.\n\nI have been here MANY times over the years and last night was THE most dreadful.  To start with the guy taking names at the front was totally disinterested in being there.  I spelled my name for him and he still spelled it wrong.  When I corrected him he ignored me.  I spelled it again and he gave me a blank stare and said kind of half-assed \""sorry\"", but didn't change it and continued his riveting conversation with the bus boy that he must have felt I  interrupted.\n\n We were seated in the back room by the patio and ignored for 10 minutes (no menus, no drinks).  Our waitress was obviously slammed because we saw her running back and forth the whole time covering the inside and the patio and another dining room.\n\nThe noise level was the loudest it has ever been.  The salsa was all tomato water and no substance.  The \""fresh lime margarita\"" had almost no tequila and the strongest taste of bottled lime juice ever.\n\nThe food was awful.  We ordered a cheese crisp and my daughter took one bite and said it was gross.  I tried it and she was right.  The oil coming off the cheese was immense and the tortilla was burnt.  I brushed off the bad cheese crisp, thinking (hoping) it was just an off night, but when I got my Steak Picado, the beans and rice were the worst I've ever had.  The rice was dry, tasteless and clumped together.  The beans were crusty and had no flavor.  But they did have a huge puddle of oil forming on the top.\n\nThe steak was fine, but after having tried the rice and beans my stomach hurt and I couldn't eat.  \n\nMy husband ordered the Mexican pizza and he had the same puddle of oil on his.  He asked for no tomatoes and it was covered in tomatoes.  The meat was fine, but again the tortilla was burnt.\n\nThe friend we brought with us barely touched her burrito.  We were all unsatisfied.  I was even more upset when I got a $60+ bill after telling the waitress we were unhappy.\n\nI will never go back.  I was willing to give them another chance last night, but there are way better restaurants to choose from and spend less money at for really good food."
1,"Used to come here as a kid and had to visit again to see if it was still as good.  Seems like they've replaced the famous breadsticks with chips/salsa- but I'm not complaining- the chips were really yummy- sort of a sweet taste to them.  Wine selection was decent, waiter was a sweet heart too- he let us know pets are welcome to join you on the patio too- something about \""Paws on the Patio\"", so if you're an animal lover it's a great place to bring the puppy.  Reminded me of the smaller sidewalk places off the pier in South Bay where everyone always brought their dogs.  As for food- we had the fajitas- very good- the steak wasn't overcooked like a lot of places tend to do, word of advice though- not good as left overs so make sure you bring your appetite and finish them there!  :)  Looking forward to going again- this time for margaritas!"
0,"I have to say that I was not a big fan of this place, however I would go back and try and savory frybread dish. \n\nI had just a simpl frybread with honey. I was not a fan, that the minute they pulled the frybread out of the fryer they added the honey. It made it a conbination of hot as hell and watery because it was hot. Because it was hot and watery, all the honey ran to the dipped spots of the bread, so most of my frybread didn't have anything on it was was plain. The taste of the frybread was not a awesome either. It was kind of bland and thin so it was a little dry. I expected the bread to be thick and moist. Like I said I would go back and have a savory diswh to see if I am any more impressed."
0,Service at this location is just the worst. I don't know if they are understaffed or just non caring. Food had been super inconsistent the last 3 times I've been here. Some days the beans look like they were scooped out of a can that's been left open 3 days. The Queso Fundido Is the only reason we go back. And if you can hail down a server the $1 margaritas during happy hour are good. The last time I went the place was nearly empty and it took 40 minutes for my order to come out. And when it had it was burnt. If you want Arribas go to the ahwautuki location.
0,"Spacious, clean amenities, rooms are beyond dated and  DO NOT expect anyone who is actually working at the hotel to be of any use, in regards to room service or general questions. We were in the wedding party so staying at this hotel was not much of an option for me and my fiance. We called about 3 weeks prior to the wedding to discuss our room and rate, apparently no one working past 430pm is able to perform this duty and the woman in charge of this does not believe voice mails should be returned. Thank goodness the bride is not a bridezilla because on the day of her wedding the entire hotel staff had no comprehension of what was going on, where the bridal party was suppose to be, and shockingly they do not understand that when one pays for services for a period of time it should be honored. When we left the hotel we ended up leaving some clothes hanging in our room and we contacted the supervisor that night of what had happened. She advised us to call at 7am when housekeeping arrived to let them know and than they would ship back the clothes, and yes they wanted to charge us. When I informed the supervisor of our negative experience and asked her to put herself in my shoes she obliged to ship them back with no cost.  After 3 weeks, an average of 4 phone calls a week to the 4 supervisors working, and the general manager who works at the most invaluable hours of the day we received 2 of 4 of our pieces of clothing. At this point I am not even upset, I just want to inform anyone who appreciates good service and wishes to be treated as any paying client would, DO NOT MAKE RESERVATIONS at Cottonwood Resorts in Scottsdale! We are not experts on hotels but have stayed at various hotels throughout the country, but I can honestly state that this is by far the worst, most frustrating hotel I have ever stayed at and above all the staff is obviously not engaged and no one, I repeat no one working the day or night shift is ever able to answer questions or return phone calls in a timely manner."
1,"A great place for the family.  This place has everything.  The prices are great for a round, the range and the food.  I like taking my son to the putting course so he can get familiar and practice.  5 bucks for 9 holes on the putting course is a great way to spend an afternoon.  After you had enough on the greens, you can practice your short game without cost.  For 1o bucks, you can get a bucket of balls(100 of them) and practice your little heart out.  The par 3 course is challenging but forgiving.  One of the better par 3's in the city.  After you get your golf fix, you can enjoy a nice menu in the clubhouse or outside on the patio.    The blackened chicken sandwich is tasty.  Angel Park is a great public course."
0,"DON'T GET CENTURYLINK! GO WITH COX, period!!!!!!\n\nThe trick about their internet is VDSL2 vs ADSL2. They only have VDSL2 ONLY! Terrible! \n\nThey try to sell me their modem which is 3 times more in price, and you can't get modem from Fry's Electronics to be compatible with CenturyLink. For example, I bought TP-8817 which is a ADSL2 and is twice as fast than VDSL2 and is even compatible with CenturyLink. I was not aware that I only had VDSL2. They keep telling me to buy their modem which I would never buy it from them, because they make a huge profit. \n\nThree times I had to talk to 800# technician to speed up the internet for the price I paid for. I had technician to come out to my house and told me that I need a new modem. He said he would give me a new modem. Later, he said I couldn't but I could buy it at Fry's for much cheaper. I did so and guess what. I couldn't use the Fry's modem that has ADSL2. Now the 800# technician told me that I have to buy their modem. This is a lame!\n\nI'm going to fight out of this contract and go with Cox. I will NEVER EVER go with CenturyLink.

1,"This restaurant does not get any credit probably for it's poor location, or lack of advertisement. I literally live across from mandarin express, and have always been skeptical about giving it a try. Parents were in town and suggested Chinese food for dinner. I was extremely lazy that day and figured I should try mandarin express since it was only seconds from my house.\n  \nThe place is very small, and looked closed because they never have the doors open. Don't get discouraged, and try it! I was actually surprised at how good the food was. Since the place is not busy, they make everything fresh right after ordering. Along with great food, I found the lady there to be very nice (she's not too fluent in eng, however she was very nice).\n  Will be going here from now on to get my Chinese food."
0,Brought my boxer in a month or so ago for a bath and deshedding.  Not only did they not deshed him he was still wet!!  They also brought him out without his collar and leash. In a dog grooming shop? REALLY?? We got rhem back right away but I'm thankful that he's a good boy and listens very well because there were other dogs in the lobby that were trying to get to him and he just ignored them.. I wont be bringing him back!!!
1,"The pork (Cochata) and brisket (azteca) were both good, although the pork was a little too salty.  The salsa was good, the guacamole was made at the table, and the tortilla chips were made at the restaurant."
0,"I have been to Vegas many times and this last Labor Day Weekend I decided to pay sin city another visit. My friends and I went to several nudies while there but I had never been to the infamous Spearmint Rhino so we decided to get all dressed up and check it out on a Saturday night. We get there and there was a small line out front, get up to pay and holy Moses they wanted $25 stinking dollars just to get in. Against my better judgment I paid the cover and walked in. There were hot ass girls everywhere; I mean lined up against the walls on the stage every freaking where!!! It was also very very crowded. We had only three people in our party so we started looking for some place to sit, ya right!!! All the seating was VIP and it required bottle service prepaid at $150-200 just for a spot on a crowded velvet couch with who knows what crawling on it. The place is super small for that many dancers. I needed a drink and so we walk up to the very packed bar. I order a Long island holy shit it cost me $18 good God this is too rich for my blood. The girls dance to one song and then switch and the songs are cut down to pretty much just the chorus as to get them off your lap sooner because the dances are only $25 each which seems like a good price until you find out the song is 2minutes long, I would rather go somewhere where the girls are a 7-8 but you get treated like a 10 and this is not that place!"

0,"We eat here all the time, but will not be returning.\n\nEven before my sister found a cockroach in her iced tea, they waiter nitpicked our every requests. Requested a pickle for my niece to keep her entertained while we were waiting to order, he wouldn't bring it until we ordered. Acted as if we were trying to scam free things out of them. When my mother asked for sour cream and apple sauce for her side item potato pancake he tried to charge us for both. Only after my mother went to pay did they discount the meal. And the waiter did not even apologize for being rude.  So disappointed."
0,"Wow. Probably one of the worst breakfasts I've had in my whole life. The biscuits and gravy are like eating warm glue. The potatoes are tasteless. I'd give it a half star if I could and that would just be for the friendly staff. Definitely several steps down from Dennys. I guess if you're over 85 like everyone else here eating, it's just food. Do yourself a favor and keep driving. I expected much more from a mom and pop place."

1,"This is my favorite buffet over in the east valley.  Many buffets out there either don't have a wide variety, the food isn't very good, or they didn't have sushi.  However, this one broke the mold.  They had a very wide selection of various asian as well as some \""american\"" food selections.  The sushi here was varied and very tasty.  The only issue that my fiance and I really ran into was having a limited selection of sushi went we would go there sometimes after 8:30 pm.  However, if you go earlier than that, you shouldn't run into a problem.  This buffet had frozen yogurt and I would highly suggest topping it with the popping boba.  Those boba were amazing and it takes you back to being a kid and eating pop rocks when they pop in your mouth.  The staff was always very friendly and the place was very clean."

0,"CLOSED\n\nBut probably for good reason, the place was not well kept. I distinctly remember the carpet stains throughout. The burgers were pretty good. \n\nI recommend the closest alternate location at Tempe Marketplace, but service was not stellar on my last visit."
1,"Very good pizza, friendly and helpful staff, extensive menu.  And kosher to boot.  But I was not particularly enamored of the \""mexican\"" food served Tuesday's and Sundays.  Stick with the pizza."
0,"I must have been there on a bad night (Sunday) because there were not actually any people there. Even the free bottle of vodka did not help the situation. It did have a good view of the strip, but that only entertained me for about 3 minutes. Drank our vodka and then moved on to Lavo...THAT is where the people were."
0,"Drive thru service was horrible. \n\nWas rushed off the drive thru radio while ordering. There wasn't even any other people there. Then wen I got to the window, I didn't get a \""hi hello thank you you're welcome bye\"" at all. I just got a rude stare, even got an eye roll when I took a second paying exact amount of coins."
0,"Paid for Lunch is a perk that we have at work and we all decide on a place to eat for that day and we order. Well we have placed an order a few times with Sofias Pizza, The first time we ordered it was okay, but we decided to try it again...They take your order and get it to relatively fast but the quality of the food is not there. The pizza was border line the first time and we tried it again and it was a Grease Bucket... You know that your pizza is a little too Greasy when you eat it and all you can taste after is Grease."
0,"My boyfriend wanted KFC so I took him to this location because it was the one closest to us. Well we went through the drive thru and there was only one car ahead of us, we waited 20 minutes until the car in front finally got their food and left. I was a little pissed because we went through the drive thru for a reason, for fast service! So, when I pulled up to the window, This girl (red head) was frantically trying to get our order together and the people's behind us. I then saw another employee (dark hair) just standing there, texting on her cell phone! She was just letting this poor girl handle all the orders and food herself. I think they should fire that girl that was screwing around on her phone because there are plenty of people who need a job and will actually work too. My boyfriend yelled through the window \""get off your phone and help her\"" but the girl just looked at us, walked away and continued to use her damn phone. Not professional at all, please fire her."
1,"I like to make my review short and simple.  Get off your computer, get in your car, turn the air conditioner on, drive down (or up ) to switch and leave the rest of the work to the fabulous chef and other great people who work there.  Seriously, The lamb appetizer did this little happy dance in my mouth.  My daughter and I both enjoyed different salads.\nMy daughter had TWO Sangria's, and loved them both.  The waiter was tons of fun.  The place was moderately busy but, the one very hysterical waiter had it under control and he let us know it.  Yep, I love to switch!"
0,"Rich people must be so fecking bored to throw money at a stunt like this.  If the individual acts weren't so talented, I would have given it one star.  It felt like an episode of SNL's Stefon listing off dumb shit that eccentric millionaire weirdos need to get an erection anymore.\n\nIn a town where you can see a hundred variety acts on the Strip, this was on par with the quality of performers ... at double the price tag.  I love the Cosmo scene, I love weirdos, and I haaated this show.  C'est la vie!"
1,"I went here during the middle of the day this past weekend, NOT at night, so I can't comment on how it is as a club.  Upon entering we were given a tour of the place, which I recommend to anyone stopping by.  After being awed, we chilled at the outdoor area.\n\nIt was a great place to kick back and chill, and it had a nice view of the strip.  The drink menu was over the top, and one of my friends got really buzzed thanks to the bartender messing up the drink order and making an extra martini (I was surprised that they actually gave the extra drink to us).  However, be sure to watch your tab; they automatically tagged on a 20% tip to my friend's bill without him noticing.\n\nWe weren't here late at night or during any huge games, but I highly recommend it as a stop to kick back and enjoy a few drinks away from the smoke and flashing lights of Vegas.\n\nFor a few moments, at least."
0,"One liner:  Overpriced small bowls of Asian food.\n\nOrdered the Pad Thai. The noodles were overly cooked and completely broken.  It was a disaapointment at best.  The other thing I had issue with was the price.  Way too high for the small bowl of food I got for it. The woman at the counter was very nice and very cheerful.  If not for her, this would have gotten a 1=star."
0,"Mediocre, unsatisfying and barely average!\n\nI joined a friend recently on a Friday night and the entire meal was barely passable. The calamari was uninspired and bland, just sauteed with a thin red sauce and a few frozen peas. Hardly inspiring. The 4 bruschetta were good, with interesting touches like honey and chicken liver, but another tasted like it had plain old strawberry jam on top of mascarpone cheese? \nThe fettucini carbonara was exceptionally bland and lacked the classic ingredients in abundance like it should including peas. Did they end up in the calamari by mistake ?  \n\nThe house recommended fresh tagliatelle with bolognese sauce was sad and uninspired and poorly prepared and presented. Really, as a Chef, I found the dish lacking any depth, including the unseasoned meat sauce (6 different meats in the sauce according to the owner, but still lacking any depth, flavor or significant interest). The sauce was mixed into the noodles already and looked very amateurish and very cafeteria-like. A real disappointment overall.   \n\nThe prices are actually a bit expensive for a strip mall and poor quality. Plastic cups for water, paper napkins for dinner service and piccolo pours of a limited wine selection only added to the lack of value. \n\nWill definitely not return. A disappointing experience that needs attention and correction."
0,"The Pizza was delicious, however ordered delivery and after 1 hour and NO SHOW, I called and they said they had delivered it to me already, NOT. After the second hour I got my Pizza. \n\nDidn't appreciate them accusing me of telling a lie to get a free pizza. The nerve. When the delivery guy finally showed up he admitted to me that he gave my Pizza to the wrong address but they paid for it?? Nobody from NYPD called to apologize for the mix up and calling me a liar. \n\nThe person on the phone said and I quote, \""we have to look out for people that lie to get free pizzas\"" BTW, I paid for my Pizza (gladly) and so did the person who got my first order.\n\nDon't order delivery and you will be just fine.Maybe they should get GPS instead of upsetting customers.   Does that sound like good business?"
1,So I was rather surprised on the fish sandwich. It was actually really good and it appeared that they do their batter for the fish! However the onion rings sucked hardcore! They tasted like straight up vegetable oil!\n\nSo in the end I love this place but I do not recommend the onion rings.\n\nAlso the servers are hit or miss when it comes to their looks.
0,"Old Decor. Service from servers who are...weird. The owner did a table touch to see how everything was. We hadn't even gotten our appetizer. The Shrimp Cocktail was large, cold and fresh. The steak that my brother in law had was very large and cooked properly. I had the pasta trio. The gnocchi was good. The other two pastas were below average and I suspect made from a canned pasta sauce. There were 5 of us dining. Some were happy with the experience. Others simply tolerated it. We dined for a special occasion, Father's Day. Avanti had been on our list of \""To-Try\"" restaurants. Been there. Done that. Won't do it again. Once you've seen one pink-walled, Zebra coated restaurant, you've seen 'em all. This place is past it's prime."
1,Awesome place to go with my family we get\nPizza and it is always good. Good costumer service. But it always smells like smoke I thought that was from the bar. Other than that it is a good place to eat at!!!
1,"I could not have asked for more than AHR Mechanical provided:  Promptness, honesty and value.  Our AC went out on a Sunday.  I called Mike and a technician (Darold)  was at my house in one hour.  Darold was friendly and only sold me what I needed to get the AC running again.  He even commented that he was surprised to see a 12-year-old AC unit running as smoothly as it was!  Clearly, he was not going to try to upsell me like many other companies have.  Darold worked quietly and had the AC working in under 30 minutes.  While the cost of AC repair is ubiquitously exorbitant, AHR offered many discounts.  They also offered a one year warranty on the part they replaced.  I would confidently call them for any other AC repairs we may need and I'd recommend you do the same."
0,Nothing to write home about! Poor service and the herb fried rice was just ok. Will not recommend this place. There may be other better options...
1,Of course this place is very fancy and very expensive but the food is amazing with a capital A. The lobster wantons were especially good as was the rice pudding with ginger icecream desert. I'm pretty sure everything on the menu is great. The waiter tried to upsell us on everything so we ended up paying for a bottle of Voss water but oh well. I knew it going in but this place is Dark and Loud! So if you're looking for a quiet meal this place is not for you.
0,"What a difference a year makes, from attending the opening last October to our experience last night. To put it kindly it was disappointing. From an overtly apathetic server to the mediocre food it was \""no bueno\"" all round. Specifically it started out with no one there to greet us and eventually a server telling us to sit wherever we like, so we found our own way to a patio table that was gritty with wind-blown silt. We ordered with no assist or any server alliteration of the menu then wine. We noticed a Malbec favorite of ours was no longer in the wine list so we asked the server about it and his only comment was we changed the wine list. Our red wine order arrived chilled and tasted like the bottle had been open for some time. Our food order arrived with no ceremony at all, simple set on the table and away the server went, only to return basically at the end of our meal. We paid and left, no thank you nada! The Sushi Room has fallen into a Robert Irvine abyss, so sad so soon."
1,"Convenient and delicious. Slightly higher price than other 'drive-thrus' but the portion size is relative. Even at the drive through I wait a little while, but honestly- it's worth it - which says alot!\n\nI will definitely keep going back."
0,"This review is for dinner only: We went for dinner mid-week. It was my first time here, and I found the ambiance cold (literally & figuratively). Waiter and manager were both very friendly and attentive. We were pleased to see they now offer breakfast all day long (always a plus when it's fresh and tasty). \n\nHowever, we were sad to see their dinner & lunch menu seemed a bit watered down. This is clearly a great place for breakfast, brunch & lunch - dinner, not so much. I'm told they used to have a delicious pork chop entree - but it's completely gone from the menu and the kitchen (we asked). I ordered the soup of the day (basil tomato) which was really great! I also got the chicken salad with a \""large scoop\"" of the chicken salad on top of the sweet salad. Large scoop? I don't think so, it was a very small amount of chicken salad and it was basically a little white meat chicken, with bland mayonnaise and a few small pieces of pineapple. Boring, small and disappointing. We also were expecting some kind of bread or role with dinner that was supposedly really good and typically provided. It never came at all. \n\nMy friend ordered the chicken & grits which is 'normally amazing.' Instead, it was greasy (a burgundy colored ring and pools of grease with seasoning pooled her dish), and she had one huge glop of melted cheese - it was actually impressive, but not in a good way. My other friend ordered the crab cake BLT, which was fairly tasty in reality. It had a horseradish flavor throughout, so if you don't like that, beware. Desert time came, and we were ready for our peanut butter pie! They were looking forward to it all week. We ordered it, and the waiter joked, \""Great, where's the peanut butter pie coming from?\"" \n\nWe thought he was teasing us, but we learned they keep changing the menu and completely did away with the peanut butter pie. Saddened, we skipped desert and paid. Food was OK at best, but amid their seeming transformation at the moment, they're a bit lost. We probably won't return to this frigid (temperature), drab (ambiance) and lackluster menu. Staff was good, but the food was a miss. Not bad, but not as good as it should have been. Seems they're trying to figure out who they are as a restaurant outside of breakfast... hope they figure it out."
1,"Great, friendly service (always same two ladies).  Fast and fresh sushi. Prices are pretty decent.  I always leave happy."
0,"I'm done with Morgan's.\n\nSure they have a good selection of shoes but I hate to feel like wanting to be treated respectfully is an imposition.\n\nI went there Monday evening found a pair of expensive sandals I liked and tried to make  contact with a salesperson. No luck so I sat down.\nThen a salesperson approached--and asked me to move!\nI got up and started to walk out. Then, she said if I wanted shoes I needed to take a ticket!\n\nI found their inability to set expectation and make some contact unprofessional and was put very far off when I was asked to move rather than a smile and \""we'll be right with you after I help this customer\"" or some such. Only when I left did a salesperson shout after me. \nI bought a pair of shoes there several months ago and it was equally curt but efficient at least.\n\nSo yesterday I drove to The Shoebox in Black Earth where I was greeting QUICKLY by a very friendly salesperson who then spent a great deal of time with me.\nI left with three pairs of shoes and spent $250.\n\nThe Shoebox has a huge selection but importantly the service was so far ahead of Morgan's that I have no doubt where I'll shop from now on.\n\nJeff"
0,"My boyfriend bought me a bracelet from another location, went here today to get my bracelet resized.  After pulling up my boyfriend's info, the salesman tells me I have to buy another warranty to get it resized even though  in the computer that there were 2 transactions that my boyfriend made (1 for the bracelet and another for the warranty). And even after I told them that's not what he was told when be purchased the bracelet, he still insisted I buy the warranty. When I called the Kay customer Service, they confirmed that I have the warranty needed. DON'T ever come here. They'll lie and cheat just to get some sale. I've been a Zales customer for at least 5 years now, I've never had any inconvenience with them. going back to the store where my boyfriend got my bracelet to return this. I refuse to support businesses that don't care for their customers, and just focused on sales."
0,"We haven't had dinner at the Courtyard Caf\u00e9 at the Orleans since the Boyd Group took over a few years ago. We used to visit regularly as the food was fresh and tasty. \n\nWell, that was then. We had dinner there tonight after a movie and couldn't believe the drop in quality of everything from the food to the service.  I had the chicken fajita salad and my friend had the Kung Pao Chinese dinner.  The chicken was so salty I could feel my blood pressure rising with each bite I took. I could identify the salad and tomatoes, but the grilled stuff that they mixed into it was unidentifiable. I believe it was supposed to be green pepper and onions. It just looked like mush.\n\nMy friend's Kung Pao dinner had \""salty\"" chicken also. It actually looked similar to what I was served. It just lacked the lettuce, tomato, and bits of corn.  Mine was a hodgepodge of food thrown together. Both dinners were disgusting as the food looked more than 1 day old and soggy.\n\nThere was a guy at the table next to us who had ordered the $6.99 spaghetti plate. As we were leaving, we saw the waiter pick up the bowl of almost untouched spaghetti when he left.  Just hope they weren't planning on just touching it up and serving it again because that's what our food looked like.  \n\nThe food was tired and so was the waitress. She looked haggard and could barely get the food on the table let alone drag herself back to refill our water glasses (which never happened).  \n\nThere are too, too many other great restaurants in Las Vegas.  For these 2 bad meals with just water to drink, the cost was $30.00.  Costly bad food!  You can bet that won't happen again!  Goodbye Orleans!"
0,"I've lived in Vegas for over 25 years and this place by far is the most underwhelming restaurant on the strip I've ever been too. Not to mention when the menus were slapped down on the table it left some piece of food smashed on it. Really yummy. Chunks of food under our table. The backs of the chairs had all sorts of splatter marks of food or who knows what. Yummy. Believe me, I'm all about making money and I'll spend money on food but to charge $5 for a fountain drink is offensive! I will never be back and I am so glad I didn't bring an out of town guest here or I would have been embarrassed."
1,"Downside\n- They're closed on Mondays\n- They don't have a drive thru\n- parking can be a pain\n\nOtherwise it's a nice branch, everything is self service and checkout but there are employees in case you need to ask questions."
1,Good food. I love the turkey w/ sprouts!!!
1,I have counted on Susan to work out all the kinks and manage my stress with twice monthly 90 min massages for several years now.  She does it just the way I ask for it and I especially appreciate the time and attention she spends on my feet!\n\nHer prices are very reasonable and I like her soothing off-strip office.   Plan to continue having Susan keep me in top condition until she decides to retire...
1,"I'm not really sure how this place only has a 3 & a half star. This place was amazing!!!!\n\nI've stayed at so many hotels in Vegas when I come. Each one is usually just ehh... I found a groupon for this place and it was a really good deal. Even when I saw the pictures I thought it looked really nice. We got an amazing suite with a balcony. I've never even stayed at a hotel with a balcony before.The room comes with 3 tvs. Even one in the bathroom! The bathroom was so beautiful as well. It comes with one of those dual shower heads, one of them was that rainforest shower head thing. There's also a separate tub with jets in there. There's also a sofabed, full stocked kitchen, stove, dishwasher, the works.. The entire room was amazing and the hotel is very modern. I wish it wasn't so cold because I really would've wanted to check out their pool.\n\nThis place was great. I pretty much would like to stay here every time I come. lol. The service was amazing and everyone was extremely friendly. We even got a view of the strip for free when we should've gotten charged for it. They also have a free shuttle to take you to the strip, it drops you off at Caesar's Palace. Oh ask for the Asian guy bellhop. I wish I would've remembered his name. =P You definitely wouldn't be disappointed staying here. =)"
0,"So after getting a flier on my door for this place.... loaded with large print coupons for enormous amounts of food for next to nothing prices, I had to try it.\n\nI ordered a 18inch 2 topping pizza and 20 wings for $13.  Sounds great right?  Came out to $15 with tax.  I thought to myself, swell deal, better than any pizza place I've ordered from.\n\nWhen the guy came to the door he said it was $24.  I figured he got my order wrong.  Nope, I was wrong... THERE WAS A $8 DELIVERY FEE!!!!!  What!  I called the place back and told them no one told me this and the flier left on my door step made no mention of this.  The manager told me he meant to call me back to tell me and I should just pay for it.  I told him he was crazy.  I gave the delivery guy a $5 tip and told him I'll never be calling back.\n\nThe pizza was horrible.  Tasteless!  The wings were disgusting.  \n\nI'll never order again.  I think my point is clear.  DO NOT ORDER FOOD FROM HERE!!!! STAY FAR FAR AWAY!!!!"
0,"Worst customer service I have ever received. I rented a beat up UHAUL truck from them, and when I returned it they accused me of \""backing into a tree.\"" Nick, the immature hothead that I was dealing with, never bothered to walk me outside and show me the damage in question. Just throws accusations at me without even asking me about it. I then wait at the counter for about 30 minutes (after I had spent the past 6 hours MOVING) for him to type some numbers on his computer. He basically ignores everything that I'm saying to him and stares at his computer. When he does reply to my questions or comments, he was rude and extremely unprofessional. After all this,  he casually gives me a bill for over $360 in damages. I immediately ask to speak with the manager, Dale, who did absolutely nothing to rectify the situation. He said that I would have to \""take it up with UHAUL.\"" He doesn't bother to ask me my side of the story or how he can help. Thankfully another employee was able to confirm that the scratch that they were trying to get me to pay $360 for was damage caused by a previous customer. It took over an hour to resolve all of this.You really shouldn't offer UHAUL rental if you are unwilling to deal with the problems that occur from your own incompetence, Dale. They also haven't responded to any of my emails asking for some sort of consolation and/or explanation. I guess they really don't care about their honest customers and their concerns. Pretty sad, considering that they're labeled as a \""family owned business.\"" My family and I will take our business elsewhere. And Nick, I pray to the heavens above that you find some inner peace and stop taking your frustrations out on honest, hard-working people. God Bless."
0,"I set up a Yelp account with the intent to only to write positive reviews, but this is going to be an exception for me. Though I haven't been to The Chuck Box for several years, I recently brought a friend who is new to town here after raving about the experience. The atmosphere is fun, the food is tasty...but I was shocked by the RUDENESS we were received with by the staff! We had barely walked in the door when the man behind the counter was already (rather impatiently) barking at us to order...yes, barking is the best way to describe it.  As we tried to advise him that we had JUST walked in and were trying to look at the menu, he continued to interrupt us and demand that we place our order.  I understand if we had been standing there taking our sweet time, but it was rather off-putting to be pressured into ordering like that, and sort of embarrassing to be addressed with that attitude in front of the other customers. Of course by the time I got my food I realized I didn't even get to order what I had wanted. There was no one in line behind us, so I did not understand why he couldn't afford us a few seconds to read the small menu. I was going to let it slip, but when the man behind the register also gave us attitude (I still don't understand why?), I had to write a review. I'd understand some curtness on their end if we were a group of loud, obnoxious students who weren't paying attention, but we were a small group of professionals who went out of our way to give this restaurant our business on our lunch break. We were very polite with them in spite of how they spoke to us, so it was all-in-all frankly uncalled for. I'm not sure if any of us will be returning...I recommend Ted's Dogs instead for your charcoal broiled cravings. It's three times as busy (because it's that good), yet the staff are just as friendly as ever."
1,"Oh. My. God.\n\nNow, I'll admit that my experience here may be different than other people's.\n\nI was in Vegas for my cousin's wedding. I arrive at the hotel, call to see where the rest of the troops are, and she calls me with this message: We're down at XYZ place in the casino. Meet us in 10 minutes, dress fancy. \n\nNow, it's going to take us at least 10 minutes just to get down there, and we just got off a plane. But, we hurry, get ready, and go down to the casino to meet the rest of the group. There were about 20 of us.\n\nSomeone that we're with knows someone, and we get a personal escort up to Mix. We all walk right in, oh, and there's a couch for us to hang at, awesome. I didn't pay for any of my drinks (someone else in the group was paying), so I can't even say anything about the prices.\n\nThe view is absolutely spectacular. This has got to be the best view that you can possibly have of the strip.\n\nAnd so we're sitting having drinks, and someone comes back from the bathroom, and all they say is, make sure you go before we leave. So I do. Umm, floor to ceiling windows in my stall? Totally strange and yet very cool all at the same time. \n\nSo, to recap:\n\nPersonal escort for entry into Mix - Free\nDrinks paid for by someone else - Free\nFloor to ceiling window in bathroom stall - Cool\nView of the strip - Spectacular\n\nHaving this experience at Mix be your first taste of Vegas - Priceless"
0,"We are on Vegas for a Dj Tour. Yesterday we discovered this amazing place!! The food is delicious! Yesterday Judy actually walked outside & told us the food was great and to try it out. We came in not knowing who she was. It wasn't till later that the waitress told us who she was. By the way our waitress was amazing. Her & Judy are the reason we came back.\n\nToday however I'm extremely upset. My appetite went away. Our waitress Toni, I asked her name so I'm hoping she didn't lie. She was extremely rude & NOT helpful. The $50 of food we ordered came, we asked for sides of ranch & BBQ and she charges us, we were not charged yesterday. I asked why the wings are dry and she had the nerve to say \""I didn't cook it\"" really? So I asked \""if you can't ask the cook I definitely don't mind asking\"" she rolled her eyes and asked of extra sides were okay.  I'm sorry but I thought I was paying for food & service? \n\nI'm never coming here again & better believe this waitress got NO TIP. We took all our food to go. \n\nSad that I didn't have time to leave a review yesterday. And upset that this poorly educated waitress ruined my experience at Radio City Pizza.\n\nSorry Jodi. Place is great. Food is delicious. However customer service can make or break an experience. Toni should be behind a cash register or washing dishes not ruining people's lunch with her attitude."
0,"My experience was similar to many others that are listed below.  I rented a Jeep because of the pricing, but was upcharged at every turn, and even threatened that I would have to pay nearly $100 if I didn't put the top back up.  The double bus situation sucked where you have to take a bus out of the airport, then transfer to a separate one.  The entire process felt slimy, but I guess that's how they make their money.  At the end of the entire ordeal I ended up paying about the same amount as I would have if I went to a dealer that had a better reputation, so there is no reason for me to continue dealing with Fox.  I've been in and out of Las Vegas several more times since then, and each time had a much better experience at other dealers."
0,"Very beautiful! was such a gorgeous place the view was a widescreen HD version of Pittsburgh point with the ducky in the river at the time I went. There was live pianist and singer that was just great. It was so pretty and formal like something right out of the titanic. I was pretty on edge I suspected my BF would purpose to me on this night at this restaurant which later I found to be pretty cookie cutter for Pittsburgh and lacking originality. It was really a great time but I haven't gone back we have since split and it taints the place for me unfortunately because my other half knows as do I that I got engaged here lol. \n\nOther then the obvious reason for not returning lets point out the positives. Great lighting. Nice wait staff, clean presentable and possibly the best view of Pittsburgh EVER. I got a Caesar salad which the waiter made table side and I got to ask questions about anchovies paste and what he was adding in our dressing. The salad had an acquired taste but still pretty good. I got a filet with mash and carrots. The meal was great is wasn't super over flavored which allowed me to taste the quality of the beef. The meat was much better then other places in the burgh and its wasn't too expensive. The night ending bill for apps, salads, diner and dessert was only near 100 and in the end they served me with a plate, plated with a diamond ring strawberry syrup in the shape of a question mark. They were really helpful helping the ex plan and definitely could tell it was something they were used to doing but i couldn't help but feel i was just another piece of meat on their engagement assembly line. I wish the location hadn't been tainted with a failed engagement cause they are a decently priced night out for any occasion or celebration, im not saying its cheap enough to invite other guest but i would definitely recommend this place for quiet romantic dates especially at night. Just if you plan to propose do it else where, I found when i was telling my engagement story to those who asked I heard comments such as how cliche, or how original, or gee-sh who hasn't got engaged there? Don't get me wrong it was great but give your gal a creative and love felt engagement stay away from going with the grain. MAKE IT SPECIAL. Make this the anniversary spot instead lol. I do agree that below food is kinda bland and mediocre for the price."
1,"If revolving doors are a gateway into a building then revolving sushi bars are the gateway to heaven. This place has plenty to devour off of a conveyor belt and a decent sized menu to accompany said belt o' grub. Saki? Yes. Selection? Yes. Will they call you a cab? Probably, I walked. \nGood stuff, man. I recommend going in groups. Just do it."
0,"Much hype for the chocolate man. Although I'm not a big chocolate person, I figured... I was in Vegas! I'll give it a shot.\n\nBecause I was unwilling to spend too much money for the food, I chose to get 2 small sliders. I don't remember what they were, but they were just generic sliders. Nothing spectacular.\n\nI tried the waffle smothered in chocolate and chocolate bits and ice cream. Syrup Desserts in DTLA is way, way better. All I tasted was chocolate, but no real flavor. The waffle was... bland and lacking."
0,"I'm not one to write a bad yelp normally as I understand how damaging they can be. My negative review of the budget rent a car at the Phoenix airport is mainly about the rudest individual working there that I have ever come in contact with. We picked up our car at 145pm on Friday, November 7, 2014.  I made our reservation through costco travel as I do most times when we go somewhere as their rates are the best. I had my confirmation loaded in my trip it App on my phone. Their system at this location of taking a number and being seated to wait your turn was great! No standing in line, instead comfortably seated in the waiting area waiting for your number to be called. This took about 15 minutes. Not horrible. Unfortunately my pleasant experience ended there. I was asked to go to a window where agent Barb was to help me. She was unable to locate our reservation. I showed her my confirmation on my phone and she immediately told me it was not their confirmation number. I advised that I had booked through costco to which she rudely responded, \""we aren't the only company they use, try next door\"". I assured her the reservation was with budget but she insisted I was mistaken and again suggested I go next door. I began looking through my emails to find the confirmation to see if it included budgets confirmation number. When I found the email, I handed over my phone to her. She scrolled through it then shoved my phone in my face and said, look, this is OUR confirmation number not the other one you gave me. What difference does it make? Do you have a reservation or not? She was now able to locate the reservation and proceeded. Never was there an apology or explanation. Next I had to endure what can not be described as anything other than badgering me into additional insurance. I understand they encourage their workers to do this and may even bonus them on their success in some way. I get that. But when I say no thank you six times, I truly don't want it! She went on to make me feel like a degenerate for not taking it as it could cost tens of thousands of dollars if something were to happen. This is easily at least the hundredth car I've rented over the years and I'm very clear on the risk of using my own insurance over theirs. I didn't need schooling from this rude individual. I would definitely rent from budget again as everything other than barb was terrific. Just a heads up if you find yourself at this location standing in front of barb, I'd suggest passing your turn and waiting for the next agent!"
0,Worst wait ever. Longer wait than a doctor's office just to return some equipment.  This store needs to hire more people.
0,"After reading all the hype I decided to check this place out.  I checked out their online menu and the lobster in black bean garlic sauce caught my eye so I headed out the door with my wife and son and went for dinner.  I did not order the stir fry.  I arrived at the location and was greeted by an older asian woman who sat us and got our beverages.  I ordered shrimp fried rice, lobster in black bean garlic sauce, pot stickers and my wife ordered the peking beef.  The food arrived and as soon as I saw the lobster I knew we had a problem.  The plate itself looked messy and unappealing.  The lobster was way overcooked and hard, I did not consume half of the dish.  The taste was very lacking and the sauce was very bland.  The shrimp fry rice was basic with peas and carrots in the dish.  The pot stickers were delicious.  The peking beef was okay.  Needless to say I will not be returning to this place and would not recommend it to anyone else. I did communicate my dislike to someone who looked like the owner or manager."
1,My husband spent several years of his life in the Grainger Engineering Library. This place is probably a second home to half of the EE/CS students at the U of I. Grainger is conveniently located in the heart of the Engineering Quad and has plenty of solo and group studying areas.
1,"Tried this restaurant per living social app and was surprisingly pleased by the food that they serve. The taste was splendid, original Thai food that really rare to find in the valley. Their Thai ice tea was perfect! Crispy tofu with peanut Thai sauce as appetizer was melting in my mouth! And my favorite Pad See Ew with beef was taste so good that I'm craving for more. They also were very generous in their portion. Overall I'm pretty sure I'll be back in this place for more Pad See Ew!"
1,I have been here a couple times now.  The breakfast croissants are amazing!  If i lived closer I would be there probably too often.
0,"I really want to like this place. The people who work here are great, but it has been so hit and miss throughout the years. During busy times (like lunch), they've given the sandwich I've ordered away more times than I can count. \n\nBut my biggest complaint is that, if you order an unwitch, they only put use one measly piece of lettuce. This is supposed to replace the bread, folks! I've never been to a Jimmy John's that does such a terrible job with their unwitches. It's so frustrating, because it's such an easy fix. Please, add more lettuce to your unwitches and figure out a system (like giving each customer a number) so that you don't give away people's sandwiches!!!"
0,"We won't stay here again.\n\nTo be fair, when we arrived, things looked promising.  The gentleman at the front desk was friendly and helpful and put us on the 55th floor, which had a great view.  When we walked into the room, the window shades somehow knew we were there and raised on their own.  I thought that was pretty cool and was in the mood to like this place.  The room had a really nice look.\n\nBut then we tried to go to bed.  \n\nFirst, they don't have comfy hotel beds.  The beds were as hard as rocks.  And the pillows are so cheap and uncomfortable, my neck was actually sore the next day.  Bed = a cheap roadside motel. I called housekeeping to see if they had another pillow option (which it said they did in their little guide) and was told that they did not have anything else.  She kind of snapped the answer without checking, so I'm guessing she gets this a lot. \n\nBut the real problem was the thin walls.  I've never stayed in a hotel with such crappy construction.  Did they not realize that in Vegas, some people might want to party and other people might want to relax?  The first night, we heard squealing girls through the connecting door and just decided we should try to stay out late enough and hope they were passed out when we got home.  But the second night, we were tired, my guy wasn't feeling well, and we decided to go to bed early so we could hit the outlets early the next day.  But the frat party on the other side of us would not let that happen.  I called security SIX times and the front desk twice.  You would not believe this Mickey Mouse operation.  Wilson from security kept making excuses about how they couldn't FIND the party and it must not be that loud and we'd need to get up and get dressed and let the security guard into OUR room so they could see if it was really that loud.  When I got his supervisor, Mark, on the line and he heard the party THROUGH THE PHONE, he promised to take care of it.  Perhaps an hour later, I called again and was told they'd have to warn the party TWICE more before they'd clear the room.  Then I spoke to the night manager of the hotel, Greg, and he was totally incompetent.  He didn't offer to move us to a different room or give us a later checkout time or anything.  When I said we'd been calling over and over for two hours, he said that the hotel policy is that people are allowed to be as loud as they want in their rooms until midnight and he \""wasn't going to compensate us.\""\n\nAlso, be aware that the valet will almost certainly be \""full\"" and even as hotel guests, you'll have to self-park far away.  This was their policy all weekend and I have to say I've never encountered that at any other hotel in Vegas--they always have room for their guest's cars. Apparently they only provide valet service to owners of the condos.  Maybe they're hoping that will make you want to buy one of their poorly-constructed condos.  And be forewarned, every time you walk through the lobby, you WILL be assaulted by insane condo salesmen.  These people are desperately trying to get you to book a tour and  I'm not at all surprised they're having such trouble moving these things.  The only people I can imagine actually wanting to own here are the frat boys who were staying in Room 5506."
0,"My two friends and I tried this place for breakfast one morning.  I have to say it has a nice atmosphere with the open windows and pretty fish tank above the bar.  I liked the look of the place but that was all I was going to get that day.\n\nOnce we were seated it took forever for our very unenthusiastic server to acknowledge us.  Drinks came 10 minutes later.  I cant forget to mention that they served the creamer to our coffee in a gravy boat...HAHA, really?\n\nAll I can say is the food is not worth the wait.  There was nothing wrong with it for us....it just took an hour to actually get to us.  Mind you, the restaurant was half empty.  Not once did the server check on us...he actually disappeared for a bit.  Someone else was nice enough to refill our water and coffee.  \n\nAnd after we sat at an empty table for 20 minutes, asked a bus boy, asked a server, and asked our own server twice did we actually get a check. \n\nNot impressed with this Vegas breakfast at all - room service would have been better..."
0,Underwhelming. This is coming from a New York girl who came thinking she would finally indulge in some great southern cooking. Boy was I underwhelmed. This place was packed and I could not understand why. The portions were extremely small. The Mac and cheese was extremely bland. The catfish was extremely cheap and from the frozen food aisle of your local grocery. I don't recommend this place for any reason. Not one thing about this restaurant is good. \n\nI had better southern cuisine in my beloved New York City. :(
0,"For the life of me I don't understand why this place is so popular, or how could it be possibly anything \""best.\""\nIt's a block away from my work, and I came here once in 2 years because I lost my mind that one day (no, because my lunch mate wanted to eat there and I was being a nice friend armed with a coupon... paying full price for this place should be a crime).\nIt's so packed on any given day, thus it's not per se the best \""quick bite\"" option. Because it is so packed, service isn't stellar either (granted the waitress I had was sweet and nice hence I gave 2 instead of 1 star). So in order for it to be \""best lunch\"" you would think the food is out of this world?! NOPE. I had a French Dip, and the best part was the au jus. It's a sandwich shop and the sandwich wasn't good. Roast beef (on menu it said it was home roasted) was dry and plain. And for the crazy amount of money you're paying for the sandwich/wrap, you get a bag of chips and a cup of soup if you dine in. \nMaybe someone can explain to me the appeal of this place, but seriously, go to Harris Teeter and get a sub, it's better, cheaper, faster and more."
1,"50's - 60's diner style with lots of period memorabilia & knickknacks (some for sale!). Great food & nice ambiance, but very slow service. Don't be in a rush & you'll enjoy it!"
0,"This review is based mostly on the price vs other Vegas buffets.  Bacchanal charges a lot more than any of the other buffets in Vegas.  I went for a weekday lunch and the price was $33, ouch!!  This is compared to $25 at the Wynn.  I really like the Wynn a lot, so I was expecting a lot more at this place.  Unfortunately, nothing excited me at this buffet.  Maybe it was just a bad day for them, but pretty much everything was underwhelming that day.  A lot of the food did not get refilled in a timely manner and a lot of the signs were not in front of the food, so you did not know what some things were.\n\nIn terms of the food, I guess I got used to the Wynn, Wicked Spoon and the Bellagio.  Most of the food here was cheapie food, not that there is anything wrong with that, as I love cheapie food.  Its just when I go to one of these buffets, I expect to try high end dishes I do not usually eat on a regular basis.  They had street tacos, bbq meats, chinese food and noodles like pho, udon and ramen.  I would much rather get these types of foods in hole in the wall restaurants and they are much better at those places.  The food overall was ok, but if you are going to charge the highest price for a buffet on the strip, I think the food should be much better than just ok."
1,I signed up for a Groupon for 4 hours of cleaning. I had scheduled an appointment and the first girl couldn't make it. Handy was great and scheduled someone else asap! Ava came the next week to clean ( which was the day I chose). She was awesome! Cleaned everything I asked for and more. I would recommend and I'm even thinking of starting monthly service with Ava.
0,"This place is a new restaurant Hong Kong style,but the food is no really good like everybody talking about..we order the curry fish ball.,they just put the curry sauce on the fish ball,the fish ball it taste nothing...and we ask for the desert on the menu.,,they don't have ..,if you don't have any desert,why you put on your menu??"
0,"I just don't get it.  Reviewers seem to really like this place but the steak I had this past Friday evening was so not worth the $65 price tag. I had the 35 day dry aged bone in ribeye. It was chewy, fatty and not very flavorful.  There was an overpowering rosemary flavor.  While I enjoy the herb it was a flavor mismatch, in my opinion.  The steak was over cooked slightly but I dealt with it. \n\nEarlier in the week, I ate at Stripsteak in Mandalay Bay and for $5 more, I had a American Wagyu ribeye cap that ranks in my top three steaks of all time.  Plus they give you duck fat fries. \n\nSkip this pedestrian steakhouse and go directly to Stripsteak."
0,"DO NOT GO HERE! Had my oil changed on 12/2/14. As I left the lot I pulled out onto University Ave and my car immediately died. I turned around and headed back to Jiffy Lube to see what the problem could be as my car was fine prior to the oil change. They took my car and \""said\"" they ran a complete diagnostic test and said that my spark plugs needed to be changed and that my battery was bad. They immediately said \""we have a guy, would you like us to call him?\"" I felt like I was being scammed, how can my car be completely fine prior to the oil change and then after the oil change I now need new spark plugs and possibly a new battery? I declined their offer to \""call their guy\"" and decided to take the chance and drive home. \n\nOnce home, i took my car to my local garage, which I should have done in the first place, and they informed me that Jiffy Lube failed to put the air filter on correctly after they changed my oil. Considering all Jiffy Lube does is change oil, I feel placing the air filter on correctly is something they do in their sleep. So, the so called diagnostic test that they ran was probably a load of BS and all they wanted to do was scam me into having \""their guy\"" fix my unbroken car, which probably would have cost me an arm and leg. Shame on you Jiffy Lube! Just remember, someone is more likely to share a bad customer service experience than a good one, you can bet I will be sharing this bad one!"
1,It was our first dining experience at Kaily's Diner and we were not disappointed.  We were immediately greeted and was given a warm welcome.  The food we ordered was great.  We all loved the garlic fries especially.   The owners were very friendly and made us feel like we want to come back.  It was our first time there but definitely not our last.
0,"BIG NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO! I prefer EZ RENTAL way better! Payless CHARGED me the $3 a day roadside and that was not quoted on my online reservation. They kept asking if I wanted insurance and insisted I got it and I kept saying no. ALSO they charge a  $11.50  FEE just to extend the rental car for any extra day.. with EZ RENTAL, they dont even charge me a fee to extend it. Also, I had the mid size car on my online quote they tried giving me a green ugly ford fiesta car which the lighter outlet didnt even work and I made them give me a Nissan Versa instead. GO WITH EZ RENTAL they are so simple and dont charge hidden fees."
1,"I know, I know, another rave review for St. Francis. \nWhy bother, you might wonder?\nBecause St. Francis is worth another 5 star review. And I'm sure they'll get many more.\nThe restaurant is great inside, exposed brick, stainless steel tables, outside bar and dining as well as the inside dining room and the upstairs loft style area.\nThe staff is genuinely friendly and helps keep the place from going from hip to pretentious, clad in their white t-shirts and jeans.\nThe food. Oh, the food. St. Francis must be the patron saint of deliciousness, the best food you might have ever had.\nThe menu is sparse and simple, A couple chicken, beef, fish, vegetarian options. But once you experience the food you realize there is no need to be any more elaborate. So many adjectives come to mind, exquisite, phenomenal, amazing, and they're all accurate.\nSo do yourself a favor. Don't take it from me and the all the other yelpers, go to St. Francis and experience the immaculate mastication. After all, eating is believing."
1,"My husband and I love Wang & King Asian Cafe. Although, we have never actually been to the restaurant, their delivery service is great! They always come on time. In my opinion they have the best chinese around the area. There is so many things to select from, whether you want sushi and miso soup or chicken and broccoli and wonton soup - the lettuce wraps are really good too!!"
1,"This is a happenin' place! I often feel rushed when I get in line to order because they have a person carrying a notepad or something taking our order as we stand in line, so I don't really get to peruse the menu to see what I want - an option is to get out of line to read the menu, but considering how busy it is, you need to stand in line, get your order and hope to get a table to sit at.  I'm not a HUGE hot dog fan, so I usually just order the \""hot dog\"". It comes with everything including: mustard, relish, freshly chopped onions, sliced red ripe tomatoes, kosher pickle and sport peppers piled onto a perfectly steamed poppy seed bun.  The best part is the poppy seed bun. So soft and warm!  They also have crinkle fries that are also really good.  I'd definitely keep coming back to this place as there are many other things on the menu that I want to try."
1,"it's almost been a year since my first visit to hash house. i have to say i've had a change of heart and i actually dig this hot breakfast joint now. \n\nto be honest, i've been back at least 3 times between this location and the new location in the M resort and have left each experience super happy and wanting more. i found a way to combat the massive servings, SHARE! ;)\n\nmy fav dish is simple and delicious. egg white and spinach scramble with country potatoes. \n\nfor the portions one gets, it's really affordable. this is the first change of heart i've had. i'm open to more. =)"
1,"The portions are huge and the wait time is rather long.  It's always an annoying comfort when you have to wait a hour to get seated.  It means you've chosen the right place to eat and that seemingly everyone else in the city has chosen the same place.\n\nThe food isn't exactly unique, but the price is definitely a steal.  My Western omelette lasted me 3 consecutive meals.  Their hash brown mash must have an addictive additive mixed in with it's goodness because I can't seem to stop scooping those potatoes into my mouth.\n\nGo, my fellow Charlotteans!  It'll be worth the wait and kind to your wallets."
0,"We've been using Elite Pest Control (apparently they'll wash your windows too! THATS COMFORTING...) since we moved into our house about a year and half ago. The main reason is because our property backs up to land under control of the county called \""BLM\"" (the Bureau of Land Management). We have a nasty bee problem with a hive or more than just one hive on that land and apparently this is the only company that BLM \""trusts\"". \n\nWe've called for them to come and spray around our house and yard several times over the past year and a half and have requested again and again, finally demanding that they work with BLM to fix the problem with the bees. They have come out to us once. And I truly believe it was BLM that forced them to and they're no picnic to deal with either. \n\nI scheduled an appointment for today for which I was under the assumption would be between noon and 2:30pm. That's not an unreasonable window of time in my opinion even though I may have other things to do during the day than sit around my house and wait for no phone calls. At 2pm I decided to call their office just to be sure the appointment was correct. A very nice lady answered and confirmed that I had an appointment but it was from 2-3pm. Oh that's fine, I can wait a little longer, must have been miscommunication on my part, so sorry for inconveniencing you! Not at all sir, have a wonderful day! Thank you! You do the same! \n\n3pm came and went. I called back. Straight to voicemail. Called again. Voicemail. I called 6 times. Voicemail every time. In an office. At 3pm on a WEDNESDAY. There's no excuse for that. It is now 6pm, they're closed unless they all decided to leave at 3 anyway, I mean, WHY NOT!? I've been waiting at my home all day. I think this is the straw to break the camels back. \n\nI'm trying this new thing called \""looking on the bright side\"" and this stupid company is making that really difficult for me. I don't know, the idea of sitting inside on a beautiful 70 degree autumn afternoon on my day off with the combination of bees and crickets and ants and scorpions and spiders and grasshoppers and roaches having a fuckin party outside and no \""ELITE\"" pest control (AND WINDOW WASHING TOO!!!) to perform the duties that their service suggests they might do... But only if they feel like it... I don't think I'm so crazy after all for saying that this company is a complete joke. They're a waste of time. They're pitiful and I truly hope they all wake up one day and realize that their lives are pathetic and worthless. \n\nELITE Pest Control. HA! There is NOTHING elite about them. Unless they want to eliminate their own pest problems!! Or if they need a window washed.... Stupid company."
1,The food is always fresh and the owners are nice people. The kalbi short ribs are a must. The beef and chicken bulgogi are always on point.
0,"I've been here several times in the past few months while in Madison on business and it was, well, good enough in many ways to return to. What's turned me off the place is what I've heard coming from the kitchen on my last two visits. I don't know who it is, but there's been loud language in a not-friendly tone (someone definitely being yelled at) being broadcast from back there. It's not professional and suddenly the food's not so good. I won't be returning. Two stars instead of one because of their past good food."
0,"Probably a decent Korean restaurant in Las Vegas, but a sad comparison to what you can get in NYC or in the Valley.\n\nTheir selection and quality of bukchon seems lacking.  In most Korean restaurants, we typically would ask for refill of at least one or several bukchons.  This time, we didn't.\n\nHate to continue with our rant, but my partner had a few bites of their Jap Chae, and asked me if we can leave.  It lacked flavor, and was very soggy.\n\nMaybe I am spoiled, or maybe this place is tailored for the drunken tourists.  What I am certain is that I probably will not re-visit."
1,Good chorizo. Not a fan of the salsa they bring out or the yellow cheesethey sprinkle on the dishes but everything else is good.
0,"Just blah. We went down here one night late for something to eat, weren't overly hungry. My boyfriend jut ordered dessert, the krispy kreme ice cream sandwich, who could not love this? That got two thumbs up. I ordered the corn soup which was actually not half bad, spicy and creamy, but the deep fried pickles....oh dear. They were gross and greasy. Limp and slimy, I peeled off all the \""breading\"" patted down the pickles with a napkin and ate them like that. Overall, for $32 with tax and tip it was totally not worth it. Could be just the late night hour, but the other reviews for this place don't seem like anyone else has overly enjoyed it. I'd say save your money and find some yummy place on the strip to eat."
0,Awful service. The halibut tasted like it was a warmed up frozen dinner.
0,Worst customer service ever. Waited 45 minutes with an appointment and walked out dissatisfied for the second time. Why don't i stop their service?  Because they'll charge me $700 for a phone I had for a month. I wanted to just give it back but they said that's fine it'll cost you $700.
0,"The Good: I could state a few mediocre points, such as that the office was clean, but they aren't really of any great import.\n\nThe Bad:  The doctor only addressed part of my concerns, as I was very interested in seeking help on 2 different-but-related medical issues. Most of his focus was on one issue, with the other being set aside for another time. Though the first visit wasn't rushed, the second appointment did not feel the same. \n\nThe doctor seemed eager to use scare tactics during our two conversations, focusing on the possible lethality of a condition, ignoring questions of severity or likelihood. He comes across as patronizing behind a slightly jovial veneer and attempting to scare someone as part of pushing a treatment plan is unprofessional in the extreme.\n\nThe doctor suggested I obtain a basic blood test, which could be done via a blood draw at his office. I asked how much the testing would cost (I don't have insurance yet) and was told it would be between $100-200. The doctor was horribly wrong, as the bill was slightly under $500. Though his office did pay part of the bill and help reduce the total cost to me (after I complained), I still paid over $150 more than I had been led to expect.\n\nThe Ugly: During my first visit to the office I handed the receptionist my driver's license to be photocopied. It wasn't until 3pm the next afternoon that I realized she'd never given it back to me. When I called back to see if I'd left it there her response was, \""Oh yes! We have it right here for you in the desk drawer.\"" Glad it wasn't lost, but if you'd had my card sitting around all day and you HAVE MY PHONE NUMBER, I believe a call back to me would be in order. \n\nIn summary Dr. Marks is not a bad guy, but is not a doctor I intend on seeing again. I would not recommend him for your use as a general practice DO."
1,"Great food and awesome service!\n\nWalked in, although I recommend reservations, for our 4 year anniversary and were greeted and sat promptly. Hostess made certain to advise those whom were assisting us as well as the manager of our reason for dining. Most definitely made the evening that much more special.\n\nWe had the pleasure of being assisted by TJ...ask for him if you decide to dine!\n\nWe ordered:\n\nLump crab cakes\nPeppercorn steak with the diablo shrimp\nChipotle macaroni and cheese\nMolten lava cake\n\nAll of which were made to perfection and served with great presentation."
1,"Awesome place to grab a beer after work! I have had several of their craft beers and the servers made great recommendations each time. I enjoy sitting on the patio and hanging out  when I'm there. Also, the owner Mat is very friendly and does a GREAT job making this a fun place to have a brew"
1,"I'm fairly new to Pittsburgh and was glad to find Commonplace. A great place to buy beans, and friendly, knowledgeable staff."
0,"This rating is no reflection on the friendly staff, they were wonderful and courteous.  The reason behind the two stars is the food.  I was not impressed and, moreover, a little disappointed.  \n\nI ordered a three meat combo with sliced hotlinks, pork ribs, and brisket.  The sauce was a little much on the hotlinks, the pork ribs were dry and seemed like they had been sitting for a few hours, and the brisket did not have any smoke flavor.  \n\nThe portion of side orders were more than adequate, but one really does not come to a bar-b-que place for the sides, does one?"
0,"This is my second visit in a week.  I discovered that they served the infamous kronut here and have been wanting to try it.  I found out the first time that they only serve them on weekends and was warned to come early.  The first time I came, I had my eye on the custard raisin roll.  There was only one left and the lady in front of me ordered it.  Apparently, what you see is all they have.  \n\nSo I came back again today (Saturday) at 9 am hoping for a wider selection.  I ordered everything I wanted: kronut, custard raisin roll, and a guava croissant.  Note! There were 3 raisin rolls when I placed my order.  Anyway, I ordered a sit-down meal and they brought me my kronuts to the table (I wanted all the pastries to go).  Then they brought out the meal I ordered.  I advised the waitress that I didn't receive my raisin roll or croissant.  She took my receipt and came back letting me know they sold all the raisin rolls.  WTF! Now I'm pissed.  She tells me she'll go see what they can do and assured me she'd make it right.  Another girl came back to me and apologized letting me know they sold them all and offered to replace it with another pastry.  I ORDERED EVERYTHING I WANTED! Anyway... I requested a refund and left.  \n\nMake sure they package your pastry when you place your order! I am upset but the staff was pleasant for both visits. They just need to work on their operation side of things."

0,Decided to stay here in Vegas for a staycation we chose the Aria Hotel and Casino because of $100 dining credit that came with the two nights during Christmas.  Upon check-in they told me I didn't have any $100 credit voucher when I clearly booked for one.  After telling them how I booked and how it was all over the internet when I booked the hotel manager on duty still did not honor my credit.  He told me I could cancel my reservation if I wanted to.  How rude?  Really??? I am already to check in and he tells me to cancel.  I was already upset upon checking in so I knew it wasn't going to be a great experience after 45 min. of trying to argue for my credit.  Oh well...I checked in to the rooms anyway because I wont let this incident ruin my stay.  After checking in they did call to say they honor it but I was already upset and so was my wife.  Definitely not 5 star service.  \nValet was awful as well since they didn't open the doors for my wife and family and just threw the keys on the seats.  I felt like they just want the tip and not give a real experience.  Overall I think the property was beautiful but the customer here sucks!!!\nI will definitely not be returning here for future stay.
0,"eh, no thanks!\n\nIt is just american-ized Mexican food and there is something in their cooking (spice/oils) that tends to not agree with me later so we have stopped going."

1,"Decided to go to Beckett's Table because of Yelp's reviews.  It was exactly as described.  We had to try the cheddar bacon biscuits and glad we did.  They were flaky, tasty and no butter needed.  And yes, we did the macaroni and cheese as well.  Listen, if were going to Beckett's table we were going to try it all!  The mac & cheese was a unique blend but it worked.  We also had the short rib dish.  The meat just fell apart.  The yukon mashed potatoes were creamy and delicious.  We may have overdone it but it was well worth it.  Plenty more to try next time.  Oh, and try an Arnold Palmer...mmm mmm!  Cool ambiance too!  Beautiful presentation & great service.  A nice surprise for the location.  Great place, give it a try!"
0,"THERE ARE NOT ENOUGH BOOBIES OR BUTTS....\nin the world, to save this horrific update of the iconic show.  I have seen Jubilee four or five times before the remake.  I couldn't agree more the music desperately needed updating.   Frank Gatson should return every penny he was paid to remake the show.  It is now disjointed, has added really poor choreography, poorly danced!  There was one thing you could say about the previous version, there were few if any missteps in the performances i saw.  In this recent performance i saw missteps and some really poor execution of song and voice over.  The \""story\"", make no sense, and only provides an annoying distraction.\n\nThe costumes remain amazing, the set pieces impressive, but it felt tired instead of new."

1,"I'm surprised that this isn't one of the highest-rated sushi places in Vegas because as an Asian foodie who often overspends on sushi, I was utterly amazed by the quality of sushi and culinary creativity at Sushi Roku. We had the sushi sampler for $65 and when it came, I saw some unusual combinations and thought to myself, \""Oh no, this had better not be some kind of Americanized sushi like Californian rolls...\"" Well, it wasn't. The truffle addition truly worked, bravo. We also like the bartender and the friendly atmosphere. The only thing that I didn't like was the noodles; after all, this place is where you go for sushi, not ramen."
1,Always fresh and hot. Service is good . This is our favorite pizza location. What's not to love???
0,"The best part of my experience here was the capriana. It was sweet and delicious. The server was pretty good and very friendly. \n\nI ordered the Jerk Prawns (which cost $14.50) and I received 5 medium sized prawns on a skewer. Not only was I disappointed in the lack of prawns, they were terribly overdone. Very dry. The flavoring was pretty ok, but couldn't make up for the dryness.  It also came with coleslaw, grilled pineapple and corn and festival bread which wasn't bad. I sampled my friends tropical salad ($7.50) which had yummy dressing and seemed more filling than my pricier meal.\n\nI was pretty hungry and I left the restaurant feeling like I needed to have a snack. I don't mind small portions if the food is really good, but this place just didn't have it. \n\nI might consider coming back here for yummy drinks, but it's doubtful that would be enough motivation to bring me back in."
1,"there is a pretty petite girl that works here and she is AWESOME. super friendly, super helpful, super non pushy, super nice and upbeat and basically the best asset to fresh EVER. i promise- i'm not her sister or friend. i live in la, and she in vegas. but the two times i visited this place she was always consistently fabby! she has a short blonde bob and is thin and petite with glasses. YOU ROCK! thank you for making my visit to fresh so memorable and wonderful!"
1,"I had the mellow mushroom burger and it was so flavorful! It also came with a ton of food.  The burger and fries were terrific, and if you get anything there, you MUST get it with the icy lemonade. You get one free refill of the icy lemonade and it is fantastic! Well worth the money and its atmosphere reflects the vibe of \""two hippies\"" having a \""beach house.'"
0,"We stayed here while in town for a business trip with my husband. The room/apartment was great, and the full kitchen was wonderful considering we had our child with us and were stuck in Las Vegas for a week.  However, the promise of a wonderful rooftop pool is lacking as the \""Skybar\"" area was filthy, the bar was closed, and the pool is the size of a postage stamp. Hopefully the 4th floor pool will remedy the empty promise of a relaxing pool and service area.  \n\nAdditionally, there was one employee who was INCREDIBLY rude on two occasions to both myself, my husband, and daughter...which is saying a lot considering our daughter is 2. She obviously dislikes children, so maybe the hospitality industry is not an appropriate career choice for her.  I do not recall her name, but she is a medium build African-American woman with shoulder length curly hair and glasses.  She  made it very clear that she did not want children in her hotel, and our child is incredibly well-behaved as we travel at least 12 weeks out of the year. I feel bad for anyone else who has had to deal with this woman with a child who was actually making noise or (gasp) actually enjoying the property outside of their room. Apparently we are not allowed to sit in the lobby with our toddler (who was quietly watching a movie on our iPad), or bring her upstairs when she is sleeping at 1:30 in the afternoon without BOTH of us showing ID (not just one of us, both..thus having to rummage through my bag and wake my sleeping toddler after a visit to the museum).  She is loud, rude, and hateful to children.  Then again, I also saw her roll her eyes and do nothing to assist an older gentleman that had stumbled, so maybe she is just overall a miserable human being. The attitude of this individual made us sure that we will not be staying at this property again.\n\nOtherwise, the room was cleaned beautifully each day, the rest of the staff kind, and the location wonderful. The complimentary valet is a godsend, and the little market is helpful, though their Starbucks is incredibly overpriced, even compared to other Marriott properties (I suggest making coffee in room...or there is a Coffee Bean across the street in the Miracle Mile Shops, and a fabulous Starbucks in Crystals).  There is an easy \""off the strip\"" walk from the property that takes you straight into the MGM as well, which was where our convention was taking place...so nice to stay in a non-gaming, quiet space to get away from the smoke and craziness of Vegas each evening.\n\nIt is just too bad one horrible employee ruined the experience."
1,"My favorite place to grab a gourmet burger in Phoenix/Scottsdale. No doubt about it, Hopdoddy is tough to beat.\n\nAt first, the setup is strange, but the more I thought about it it makes sense. You are required to stand in line to order your food, all the while standing by the bar and beer taps. At first awkward, however, the move is genius. For all of us beer fiends out there, this is your perfect chance to order a brew and sip on it in line while cashing out at the bar.\n\nSecondly, while you're in line they bring around samples of their milkshakes. \""Do you want a free sample of our vanilla bean milkshake?\"" Uhhh, yes I do, thank you very much. \n\nThird, the burgers are awesome. Perfectly sized and cooked just right, they come a-la-carte and you're going to have to order your fries separately, but they're large enough to share. My go-to when I'm at Hopdoddy is the Goodnight Burger (add bacon and make it a \""Great\""night), with the truffle fries. Do yourself a favor and pick up some of their homemade BBQ sauce for dipping, its delicious. Don't forget to follow everything up with their salted caramel milkshake. They give you an extra large straw so you're almost guaranteed to get a brain freeze - totally worth it.\n\nThe great thing about the madness of ordering through the line when you first arrive is that you get a \""server\"" to take care of you once you've sat down and when you're done eating you've already paid (unless you got dessert or another beer - womp womp)! You can wipe the burger off your face and peace out whenever you like, no waiting on a check.\n\nI highly, highly recommend Hopdoddy Burger Bar when you're looking for some bomb burgers to stuff in your face."
1,"I was there this week....the food was amazing!!! Very nice atmosphere ... Nice music , defiantly be a regular spot!!!\nMust visit."
1,"This hotel is not very expensive and all in all it's OK. Nice for kids, pool is OK, we've been treated well, just minus 1 because the non-smoking room still smelled (ex smoking room i suppose). \nTip: there is a very good mexican reastaurant just around the corner, the El Dorado Cantina"
1,"All these poor souls had to wait hours to get in only to be turned back due to their poor choice of attire.  Dirty shoes, collared shirt, etc.  I got there a bit early at 9:30 pm and was the first to walk through the doors with my t shirt and blazer and nice kenneth cole shoes.  \n\nThe club was everything i expected!  HOT HOT women with a very diverse crowd.  Everyone was dressed well and friendly.  Drinks were strong and the bartenders kept it flowing!!  I'd definitely go here again!"
0,"I went to the Mint with my family when they were visiting from NY.  We thought that it would be a really fun place to go.  We went around 6pm (right in time for happy hour) and we were the ONLY people in the whole place.  My mom had purchased 2 Travelzoo certificates and asked the server if we could use both - it did say on the certificates that we could not - but she asked anyway.  The server asked the manager and he was nice and did point out that we couldnt.  Understood.  Rules are rules.  Well, during our stay - the man who I am assuming was the manager, was sitting at the bar with a big bandage across his nose.  EIther he had just had a nose job or had gotten into a fight the night before.  Not sure which.  We sat outside and had a clear view of him sitting at the bar trying to talk, eat, and drink with this nasty bandage on his nose.  Sometimes its just better to take a day off then to come into work and gross out the only customers there.  The food and drink was great.  We were waiting for our check, then we hear this hysterical crying and screaming inside.  Some girl was sobbing and ran to the bandaged manager.  All of the servers gathered around.  It was totally unprofessional.  This went on for over 10 minutes while we sat there and waited for our check.  On our way out the front door, the bandaged manager and the sobbing girl were sitting on the front stairs.  We actually had to walk around them to get out to the car.  My mom even asked if she was ok.  Not something you want to see while you are eating, drinking and visiting with family at all."
1,"Nice food, nice staff, nice ambience.\n\nI come here because of a monthly meet up and it's a good place to be.  Because of the time, it's handy to order dinner whilst doing some stitches and having a banter with the rest of the group.\n\nI had a burger with add ons of bacon and blue cheese.  It was good and the bun was good too.  It also came with slaw which was good but difficult to get and stay on the plate and skinny fries.  i asked for mayo on the side and no problem, as it was there in secs.\n\nThis is my second trip to Hemma and both times staff have been friendly and food good.  There is no bother settling up you're part of the bill separately either."
0,"In my previous review, I made the argument for Charcos in how they avoided the dreaded \""drama plate\"". I ordered something interesting and it managed to taste great without any sort of micro-management.\n\nAlas, I must step down a few paces from my previous praise, because the drama has creeped back in. What used to be gourmet chicken on a budget is now a roll of the dice.\n\nThe confidence from my first visit seems gone. Employees seem confused; not sure whether to charge up front or when the food is done. Or what goes on a particular sandwich. The wait time has doubled. The \""wraps\"" sometimes use burger buns instead of pitas. The fries sometimes come without that seasoning that worked so well. It's like a roll of the dice with your twenty dollar bill on the line.\n\nWhere is that Charcos we were first enthralled with? I hope it comes back soon, because I'm not sure it's worth being burned a third or fourth time by something on the production line."
1,"Its an awesome bar with a lot of potential. Could easily be the best local bar in Vegas if the poeple that manage it were not complete idiots. The bartenders are nice and the slots are pretty good. The drinks are a little pricey compared to other local spots and they do not have any drink specials or happy hours.They also dont serve real food just crappy bar food but there is a Robertos attached. It is however a great place to have a party cause the bar is huge then there is a seperate area with 2 pool tables, darts, golden tee and bcuk hunter.  There is a \""VIP\"" room and a circle lounge area, then another full bar with a dance floor and stage, then there is an outside bar/ Beach area. Overall on a good night this place is a lot of fun."
1,"Great find! \n\nWe were hoping to hit up Firefly in the same center, but @ 9pm on a Saturday evening without reservations, it was 1 1/2 hour wait for a table of 4 and we had later plans to get to. \n\nNow what? Check Yelp! \n\nWe did, and this place looked like a good shot. \n\nOur server told us it was 50% Thai, 30% Malaysian and 20% Chinese (yes, I can do the math :-) We had a selection of lamb curry, bbq pork, spicy beef satay and the basil chicken, along with every type of rice (jasmine, brown, coconut - coconut being my fave). All dishes were exactly the spice level we ordered - go for a 9! The flavours were vibrant and plentiful - great to sweat that 110 degree weather out :-) \n\nService was very kind and the best thing about this cuisine is the wait time for dinner = nearly 0. Perfect! \n\nOk, so the ambiance isn't your typical \""Vegas\""; rather subdued (they really do need to throw in a bit of music in the background or something). But it was nice to be in there, they have air conditioning, Singha, good food and great prices. \n\nWe left full and happy :-)"
1,"I am removing one star from this place because of the extremely slow service. This is an order at the counter place, so you expect it to be a little bit faster. But that's not the case. You actually wait longer than a sit down restaurant. I would subtract more stars due to the frustration every time I visit, but the food is just that good! This is still a must try place. But if you are in a rush or have children with you, you might want to pass. Or call your order in so it's ready for pick-up."
1,The Burgers taste like in and out burgers and tehy are just as good. Great service and great attutude from everyone. Cheap to eat here with a good portion of what ever you order.
1,"I just went back and had the Kal Bi (marinated flanken style beef ribs) bento lunch box.  It was very good, so I'm upgrading my rating to four stars."
0,"Oh, why do I keep coming back here? I know it's close, but it's really just not that good. I still think it tastes like food I can easily cook myself but I'm downgrading a star because the service is sooooo slow...At least when I'm cooking for myself I can clear my dishes as fast as I want. This place would be a great candidate for the TV show that pimps out sad, sorry places and makes them cool again."
1,"great place if you love wine.\n\nneat place to go to--the food is pretty good, the atmosphere is fun--somewhat on the noisy side, but it is worth the wait.\n\nand the wine--red or white----or both if you must.\nand it keeps on coming and coming.\n\nbest to have a cab or a designated driver if you like wine."
0,"Went on a Thursday night. We sat outside and the service was good. Our waitress was really cool and was great about checking up on us.\nHOWWWever, a friend of mine and i shared the Buffalo Chicken dip and we both got violently ill. When we first got the dip, we were both a little hesitant because it didn't look great. We went ahead and tried it and it tasted alright. I'm really regretting that decision though seeing as we have both been sick all day!! Don't get the Buffalo Chicken Dip - trust me."
0,I've been to Max's many times over the years. I've always had their club sandwich which never disappointed me. Last Friday my wife and I tried the fish fry and we were very disappointed! We received one and a half pieces of fish. Who ever heard of half a piece? The fish wasn't that great either and the cole slaw was even worse! Last time for us!!!  :-(
1,"Seated quickly, order handled efficiently. Staff brisk but moving many people through! Would eat here again! Pot stickers homemade and grilled to perfection."
1,"For years I had always thought the best gelato/ sorbet was found in the Bellagio Gelato near their swimming pool. Now I can say that this place has now won number one in my book for Strip sorbet. Located near the casinos in the Paulazzo, you usually have to wait in long lines but let me tell you it is worth it. The Prince of Taiwan is lactose intolerant so I only tried their sorbet. Got the mango and pineapple, and dear Buddha , it was as if I was eating the fruit, just softer and more cold. It was heaven on earth for me that day, and even all the big breasted cougars roaming the casinos looking for cubs could not detract me from having a love affair with my sorbet at this wonderful little gem."
0,We had bad experience. The burritos were cold on the inside and the soda machine was not calibrated correctly. I would skip this one.
1,"I love,love,love this place. They have organic and gluten free items. The all you can eat salad bar is my favorite. The Salmon Sandwich on gluten free bread is incredible and hits the hunger spot. I love that they are a true healthy restaurant. The staff is usually always friendly. I knew someone who worked for Jasons deli for a long time and I can attest that they take pride in making their customers happy, and the place extremely clean. I wish the environment was a little more welcoming and cozy, but since the food is delicious and at the right price, Ill let the environmental feel slide."
0,"Hate to say it, but this was the only place I didn't enjoy while in Montreal.  I ordered an omelette with cheese, bacon, tomato (they offered a make your own omelette with 3 ingredients).  What I got was a tomato and bacon omelette that was over cooked and then covered in melted cheese.  I\""m sure I'm not the first person to order this item so i'ts not possible they didn't know how to make it, right?  And this was a French Bistro, right?  To be fair, my companion enjoyed his eggs florentine, and they did look delicious.  Maybe I just got the cook on a bad morning."
0,over priced and over rated.
0,"Ate at the bar and Rick the bartender was the most miserable guy ever... Food was ok just but lacks imagination. Fish platter has the same coating on the scallops, fish and prawns ... Zzzzz,! \n\nNot worth the money even with the 2 for 1 entree voucher.\n\nMai Tai cocktail using Cabo Tequila was good ... That was 5* but Rick and the food -4* \n\nNot coming back"
1,Really good deal if you buy a meal then you get free drink with that which is really awesome. The teri beef and teri chicken combo is good. This location is hidden inside a citi bank plaza.
0,This was my second visit to this location. I received a lot of food for my money but the food is just okay... I love Mexican food and this place is just cranking it out without any real quality. The service was fine and I did not think it took long to wait for my food. I'm passing on this one.
1,"I keep meaning to ask if they do gift registries at this store.  Because my friends say I'm hard to buy for, and I just don't get it.  Go to Made.  Apply blindfold.  Spin.  Stop.  Walk forward.  Buy what you touch.  Unless it's baby clothes.  It's that easy.\n\nI really love this place.  I make people go here.  I got a rockin' ring here.  Some cool books. Of course a few magnets.  Recent purchase was a baby t-shirt (for friend) that said angel on the front and had a pic of wings on the back.  Aw....  And the selection is often changing as artists create new things. \n\nYou should go.  You need to go.  Just go."
0,"this is located in what used to be a pretty happening strip mall because there was one of the only movie theaters around there.\nthen a new googaplex opened and the whole area kind of dwindled. \nwings are good, i attest to that. but... random shooting where a person dies and four others have to go to the hospital? not really my idea of good time."
0,Have visited the wash a few times with better than average results. Vacuums are powerful and towels provided to wipe off vehicle are a nice touch. Decided to sign up for the monthly pass at $19.99 and proceeded to cancel the auto renew so they wouldn't charge me for infinity months. Entered the wash and had the passenger side mirror ripped off my truck mid wash. Upon exiting I was instructed to fill out a loss form and they would take care of me. They have not. After several trips back they are claiming my mirror was defective from FORD. They canceled my monthly package and refused to refund my money. The pass was cancelled too. Attorney contacted. Beware of this organization and any car wash they own!
1,"Food is really good. Service is terrific. The bartenders are fantastic. Try the shrimp fajitas. They offer other Mexican dishes in addition to fajitas. If you like frozen margaritas order them with Cuervo Gold...don't use the pre-mix frozen unless you get a shot of tequilla added to it. Also, they cook everything right there in the open. Be prepared to smell like a delicious fiesta after you leave."
0,"This place is hit or miss.  The 1st time I went, it was a great experience.  I was able to walk in (without an appointment) and get a gel manicure and a pedicure.  Libby was my technican, and she was fabulous. 5 stars!!!!  The manicure was great, and lasted the full two week as promised (would have lasted longer but it grew out too much and I started picking at it.)  My pedicure is still going strong after two weeks and looks great.\n\nSo I went back. And I had a different person (I don't know her name.)  Well, let's just say that my hands still hurt a day later!  She cut my nails unevenly (some are rounded, some are squared), and the polish is uneven as well and poorly applied at the edges.  My cuticles hurt to high heaven, and my nails are too short. 1 star!!!  \n\nI'm only going back only if I can get an appointment with Libby.   \n\n5 stars for Libby, but overall 2 stars, because I think that a salon should be able to provide consistent service."
1,"What a goddamn bummer this gym has permanently closed.  For all the griping about \""old equipment\"" it really was the only serious spacious hardcore bodybuilder gym near the Strip, with the same feel as Golds in Venice.  Tourists could even hop one city bus down Flamingo to go grab a quick workout.  Sure there are other Golds in Vegas but even with a rental car they are all on the suburban outskirts, beaucoup miles away. This joint at Flamingo & Sandhill had been here for years and I'm sure I'm not the only one sorry to see it gone."

0,The service was abominable.   Didn't have what I ordered and didn't reimburse my credit card.  Food was aweful.  Don't fall for the picture menu. Doesnt look anything like the pictures hinted.  I hardly give any reviews but felt compelled to do so for this horrible establishment.  You have been warned. Avoid at any cost
1,"My new favorite breakfast place...of all time and everywhere!\n\nLove the central location, love the cute decor (especially all the letters and envelops under the table glass, with the adorable mason jars with candy canes on them.) I liked the order process as well (sounds silly I know) but I like how you walk in and the counter to order is right there, you quick look at the menu, and you order and pay all at once. \n\nI ended up getting a Mimosa, and the Breakfast Burrito. Both so fantastic. The Mimosa was the perfect blend of Orange Juice and Champagne...I downed it pretty fast. And the burrito was pretty good, came with Guac, sour cream, hot sauce, and your choice of Potatoes, Toast, or a tossed greens. I wish I had opted out of the potatoes, and went with the toast. Just wasn't a huge fan of them I guess.  \n\nOver all pretty great experience at Short Stack, loved how open it was, and how sweet the staff all were, and the great food as well. Trying out the breakfast sandwich or Pancakes next time though! :)"
0,the service was slow as can be!! we had to wait an hour to be seated and about 45 mins for our food to come out. i ordered a medium well steak and it was chewy and burnt! my root beer taste like syrup so i asked for water and that took about 20 minutes! every time we needed our waitress we had to flag her down. we added crab legs to our meal for only 8 bucks and they were delicious! although they were dangerous!! they has HUGE SHARP points on them which dug into your hands and made them nearly impossible to crack open! i will NOT return!!
0,"This is a chain-franchise-knock-off. It's not good, it's not bad. It has the same value as fast food, but a little nice and therefore you will pay more. It's a place I visited while moving. I chose it because I could see it from the Elliot Street. The service was ok, but the food was far from impressing. I ordered the waitress corporate predetermined recommendation - and it wasn't good. It tasted like anything you can buy in the frozen meals section from the grocery store, prepared well. I will not be coming back.  \n.. und das ist was es ist"
1,"Milissa you don't look to high roller yourself, why are you going to roadside motels.  Anyway i have been to vegas 6 times and am going to be their this month.  2 trips ago i stayed at the statosphere and it was a nice stay.  I won 2500$ on a elvis slot, the dealers were nice and had a good time here.  The room was clean and the place was out of date but not dirty.  What the fuck you want for 50 bucks a night.  I stayed at the MGM and the pool was the thing i liked better, but i don;t come here to swim, its to party and gamble.  Both start at the stratosphere, i would not hang out here after 10pm but will stay here any day."
1,"The MOST beautiful hotel.  Maybe ever.  Staying anywhere else just isn't as fun.\n\nLa Bette (yuck!) has been redone as Tryst, and is quite lovely.\n\nSplurge on a cabana.  Don't miss the \""adult pool\""... it's hiding on the other side of the casino cabana, if you're lost.  Why every pool in Vegas isn't topless-optional is a complete mystery to me."
0,"2 stars for the awesome food. All that we ordered tasted good. But the service was below par. Especially this one server,  Arshad. He threw too much attitude!  Customer service is a very basic necessity when you decide to run a restaurant. The minimum one can do is be polite while taking orders, you needn't smile, needn't go out of the way to help customers. But you CANNOT be rude and outright snappy! We were there for a family get together and he began by not helping to seat us, not getting silverware, and when we tried to place orders for some bottled beverages, he refused to get them saying \""kitchen is closed\""! Couple of other families had bad experiences with the service too. But 2 other servers were the saving grace of our evening.  Overall, good food, bad service."
1,"We had a drink at the bar, then dinner for my fiancee's birthday. The drinks were great, and the bartender was efficient and personable. Dinner was awesome, we had the teriyaki steak lettuce wraps for an appetizer and steaks for dinner. The food was fantastic, service was a little slow. However it was a Saturday night and busy, so that's probably why. We liked it overall, and would eat there again."
0,"Cons:\n- Complete dump\n- Cockroach motel\n- Insanely hot with the A/C units blasting into the non-existent hallways (you walk outdoors to get to your room)\n- Very confusing venue to find your room\n- Room is small and dirty\n- Bathroom has stains\n\nPros: \n- BEST LOCATION on the strip for the price\n- Right across from Caesar's Palace\n- Relatively Cheap\n\nOverall: If you're going with fraternity boys, this place is the best location to stay for the price. Do NOT go here if you're trying to impress your loved one or with your spouse. It will be an absolute disaster."
1,"If you are still celebrating your 40 something bday, more than 10 years later...I absolutely reccomend Fascinations!  I visit Scottsdale once a month and finally got up the nerve to investigate Fasinations!  I was nervous and aprehensive.... I remember my first experince years ago.. at a \""toy\"" store... It was creepy and uncomfortable, I wanted to ask questions, but I wanted to leave more!   This was like a dream come true...the store is very upscale, the products are well displayed its clean its neat, and the best part was the help I received.  I wasnt sure I needed help, just kinda wanted to check things out...which they let me do for a while.  The sales girl, Tianna was wonderful!.  She didnt push or prod, but asked some general questions and then began my education!  I couldnt have imagined what a \""much younger' gal could share with me...but I came away with knowledge and appreciation...(she was funny and made me feel very comfortable, like we were old friends....) oh, and several new toys.  I really enjoyed myself and I will definitely be visiting each month when I travel to Scottsdale...I hope Tianna is there and I cant wait to see what's new!  Thanks!  I'll see you next month!"
0,"If you like a lot of cheese this is your kind of pizza place. \n\nScratch that. I like the right cheese to crust ratio. I also like my cheese more than just melted.\n\nAmalfi has all the right tools but can't build my kind of pizza.\n\nThey have a real oven with a stone deck. If I ever see one of those Domino or Papa John type of pizza ovens I walk out. That's why no Spinattos or Rush St Pizza for me.\n\nThey have a good crust and a good sauce. Even the pepperoni is good. \n\nBut with the pounds of cheese they put on a pizza, it just can't cook to the right texture in a brick oven at a super high heat. It just melts into a big mess.\n\nSad to say but for the price I would rather go to Papa Murphy and take and bake.\n\nBut that's just me. If you like your pizza swimming in cheese, so much so that if you tilt the pizza slightly it will all pool to me side then this is your place."
1,"Food is good, beer selection is good, and the service is good!"
0,"After hearing so much about this restaurant, we left here terribly disappointed. Gyros were cold and tasteless, the salad with the gyro platter was watered down and soggy, and the service was uncoordinated and sporadic. \n\nDessert was the best part of this meal, and that isn't saying much. Probably will not return."
1,"Latte and muffins were good; latte could have been stronger. The service was friendly and the space was very cozy. But it wasn't so good that I need to run back, or chose this coffee house over one with a drive thru."
1,"Every time my fRiend and I have gone here it has been quite good.  We usually would take lunch at her lunch hour, which is 11.  This is about the time they open up.  This means we were the first to be served whatever they had (read: fresh) and without much of a wait.\n\nThe food here is fairly good, comparable to many of the other thai restaurants in town.  I am addicted to Tom Ka Gai soup and they have an excellent soup here that I almost could have without ordering anything else.\n\nI do not like that they serve soda in cans.  However, the overall price of most items here including drinks is very affordable.  It is a very small restaurant so I wouldn't recommend much more than bringing a few people here.  \n\nHrmm...think I'm going there for lunch...writing this is making me crave..."
1,This is one of the best hamburger establishment I've ever gone too! They make an amazing burger! I am gluten free so I don't have many options out there. They sure do provide many choices for me. I highly recommend!

1,"Depending on your style or clothing preference, this outlet may be or may not be for you.  If you're more in to the higher type class clothing I suggest you head out to the premium outlet near downtown vegas but if you're in to surfing brands, good kicks, and skinny jeans, this place is for you.\n\nLevis is always having great discounts on their jeans so before you go paying for it full priced at the near by Town Square, this place is just about 5 min drive away and if you want to save, why not check it out.\n\nQuicksilver, Hurley, Billabong, and even Oneil are all here, so duuude come on braaaah, check these places out for totally awesome sales duuude.  \n\nNow for the kicks....Nike, Adidas, Converse and other great brand names are here too.  Im not really knowledgeable when it comes to how much these shoes should be compared to whats out there because all I buy are chucks so I can't really tell you whether the deals here are great or not.  \n\nThis place isn't as nice or as big as the Premium but its really close to where I live and has all the stores I prefer and this is the reason for my 4 star."
0,"How the hell can you claim to have all you can eat sushi when you damn selection is only the 10 basic rolls you can get an any other sushi restaurant for nearly the same cost as buying them individually?\n\nI really want to give this place 1 star but I'm pretty much ranting on the AYCE sushi aspect of this restaurant.  I only came here because it was the closest sushi place from my buddies house and to be honest, I was PUMPED to come here since I was starving for AYCE sushi and wanted to try some new stuff.\n\nThe building is aesthetically pleasing and it does have a warm/cozy feel to it.  But the service was lacking (mainly since the waitress seemed to forget that I existed). \n\nAnyways, I look at all the stuff on the menu then come to find out every single thing I planned on ordering from the AYCE sushi was not on the AYCE sushi menu.\n\nFuck.That.Noise\n\nI have never been so tilted after eating sushi, it fucking defies the laws of physics.\n\n#Hungry\n#Ripoff\n#HorribleSelection\n#WelcomeToSheetySushi"
1,"Amazing. Amazing. Amazing. Thanks Yelp! Just searched and saw amazing reviews and took a leap of faith & found a gem! \n\nAn overall great experience from the moment we arrived. First off, this place is a very small restaurant. When we walked in they asked if we made reservations. Of course we didn't because we were first timers. But luckily there was seating outside and Mother Nature was being kind that day. \n\nSomeone automatically brought out our Lemon & Cucumber infused water. Fancy? The best water I ever had in a restaurant. Did NOT taste like tap water like most restaurants. I pay attention to the waters! I can't stand when waters taste like unfiltered tap water. \n\nOur waitress, Devynn, was amazing. She gave us great suggestions on what to order. \n\nWorld Famous Spinach Salad $11- this is a tempura spinach salad with a lime dressing that has ground chicken, onion, cashews, and carrots. This is probably the most unique dish I have ever ate in my life. You can either toss the salad with the dressing OR eat it like chips and salsa. We went with the chips and salsa method so we didn't drown the spinach tempura. It is a MUST GET. They are famous for this! I ordered it and the beau finished it! Lol that's how delicious it was. \n\nBeef Jerky $8- bomb! It actually wasn't too jerky if that makes sense. You were able to chew it and not struggle. It came with a roasted chili sauce that added the right kick. \n\nShrimp puffs $8- they were like wontons that had shrimp, cream cheese & curry mixed inside. This was probably my least favorite in the meal we ordered BUT still had a good taste to it. I honestly could not taste the shrimp.. \n\nChicken Pad Thai $16- BEST PAD THAI in town, hands down. They have really good spices so we ordered it as a level 2 and oh wow it was amazing. Spicy but not too spicy. It was a large portion which was appreciated. The noodles were cooked perfect. Everything about this dish was perfect. \n\nThe presentation of the dishes were beautiful too. They added an Orchid to each plate. How did they know that Orchids were my favorite!?\n\nHighly recommend this place if you are in the summerlin area!"
1,"This is one of the prettiest places to dine in the Phoenix Metropolitan area.\nSomeone once told me that historically the place had been a brothel in the 1920's. It has kind of a Shangrila Hacienda feel to it. There is a little pond in the walled courtyard/outide dining area stocked with waterfowl, and on several occasions I have seen a wild Great Blue Heron inside!\nWhen my parents came to visit from Massachusetts I chose a hotel destination close to this place because I think it really feels like a vacation in here!\nThe food is pretty good. They have this deep fried Machacca and grilled green onion thing that they serve with warm melted cheese and hot tortillas which is kind of fun for a group.\nI like the Rellenos here. They have picadillo in them.\nThe bar area is large with a nice fireplace and well stocked with a good roasted tasting salsa and chips, as well as plenty of icewater pitchers while you sometimes have to wait for your table.\nVery picturesque and great for photo-ops or possibly a wedding party or something.\nNot the most incredible food on earth, but neither is it ever disappointing, and the view here at sunset is like magic."
1,"My friend is amazing and got us in for free!  I have to admit, they have some cool sea creatures, but I'm not sure I'd pay $18 for admission.  Though, maybe I would if I had to entertain kids..."
0,"Went there with my husband for the first time a few months ago. When we walked in, it's like everyone knew we've never been there but we decided to try it since we had a Restaurant.com coupon.  The place wasn't busy with 3 other people dining at the bar.  It took over 30 minutes for the waitress to even come around to get our drink orders and when we wanted a few more minutes, that took even longer! The food took long as heck to be delivered and it was okay. It wasn't good but it wasn't the worst food.  I believe the waitress was being fake towards us because it was like she was trying to be nice but you could tell she wasn't happy we were there with our coupon...and she over charged us but my husband just wanted to leave.  We will never, ever come here again."
0,"A while ago I had a bad experience w/ Pita Jungle at Arrowhead and after that experience I decided to lay off of Pita Jungle for a while until I discovered the downtown location. I figured, a new location for me will do. Today was my third time visiting with my girlfriends and I ordered my usual, a falafel wrap. Three bites into it, it was good, as usual. Before I can continue eating, I removed the foil wrap and there was piece of chicken on the side of my pita bread. I totally lost my appetite since I haven't had meat in 10+ years. I made the waitress aware and she offered to bring out another one. I had already lost my appetite so I did not want it. She brought out the bill to me and said that the manager wouldn't charge me for my meal, well, I hope not since I didn't get to eat it. I was paying for my friends because we were celebrating a birthday so when I paid I informed the waitress that there should be a bigger discount because it's not just about me loosing my appetite it's about the fact that I sat there while my friends ate and at one point they didn't feel comfortable either and felt bad. She informed me she would ask her manager. She came back, dropped off my copy of the receipt, and walked away. Not saying anything at all. I opened the bill and the manager didn't take any additional discount or anything. What a shame. This is the second bad experience and after this I DEFINITELY won't be giving Pita Jungle a THIRD try!"
1,"Love the food alot ex. SIsig,sinigang, lechon and crispy pata yummm :) . But dont go here when ur extremely hungry coz it takes a long wait for ur food to be serve :) servers are sweet and polite. Nice and clean place. Overall  i love this place."
0,"Made the mistake of eating here twice. Once, because I thought it would be good based on what others had told me, and once because someone else insisted we go. (They were sure it would be a much better experience my second time around.)\n\nHere's a tip for the owner/manager:\n\nHire wait staff whose first language is ENGLISH or who speak it FLUENTLY\nHire wait staff who are friendly and efficient\nHire wait staff who act like they really care if I return\nHire wait staff who really want me to tip them\nTAKE CREDIT/DEBIT CARDS; This is 2012, nearly 2013. The IRS must love you because you don't pay taxes on what you actually make. (Cash only means you only report what you want to, not what you actually rake in. How clever)\n\nThe bacon, the pancakes, and fresh squeezed orange juice were great. The negatives above don't make it worth the extensive wait for a table. This place is over priced, doesn't take plastic, and the wait staff need a huge improvement. \n\nI'll take IHOP any day of the week over this silly place. You do remember you're in Scottsdale, right?"
1,"Okay this is an update to a previous review.  I so would've given this place a 5 star, but some of the workers are super stuck up!!  Get an attitude check on your employees and this place would def be a 5 star !\n\nPros:\n  All you can drink option\n  beer pong, beer bong, and shots off an ice sculpture\n  interactive atmosphere\n\nCons:\n  Attitude-induced female workers\n  Crowds aren't too friendly\n  All you can drink option isn't too great.\n  Small dance floor\n  Electronic Dartboard, but no one could tell me where to get darts!\n\nVerdict:\n  Despite the attitudes I encountered. there was a plethora of games and things to do....Still a good place to go with a few friends and get drunk for a decent price.  I think the bracelet is $35 for mens and $25 for women.  Don't quote me on that though.  I won a free  all you can eat pass so I didn't pay anything.  Just tipped my way to a drunken-stupper.  \n\nInfo/ Tips:\n  Just so it's not a surprise.. the AYCD bracelet gives you the following-  Whisky, Vodka, and Gin as a mixer option.  No this is not brand names, but I must say that Whiskey could of passed for Jack Daniels... then again how do I know... I was drunk!\n\n  Get a game of beer pong going.  Just get enough beers to start the game.  Plenty of tables, free cups, and pingpong balls available\n\n  There is a 4-hosed beer bong, but the thing was getting no action and the bartender couldn't give me a price so I just passed and downed some Jager off the ice sculpture that catapulted a large dose of licorice flavored courage down my throat.\n\n  The dance floor is small but  large enough to hold 20 plus people.  \n\n  Very interactive...listen to the DJs cues for giveaways and prizes throughout the night.  \n\n  There's a bar at the far north corner of the bar... go here to avoid crowds.\n\n  Try your hand at the boxing game.  900 is a perfect score.  Hit it!!"
0,"this hotel should be closed.  THE PICTURES BELOW ARE NOT ACCURATE.\nthe carpets are stained, the ceilings cracked and stained, cigarette burns \nin bathroom,  no railing on bath tub to hold on to, chairs dirty, things on the floor, you could not and would not want to walk around barefoot at all, VENDING machines snacks were stale, the bed was bad i was in pain and still am, dogs are allowed in rooms, so you do not know what the stains were, also, feces outside and smells, there were bugs constantly coming in to the room, hotel has nothing to keep bugs away.\n\nHOTEL SHOULD BE TORN DOWN AND CONDEMED."
0,"The service here has really gone downhill.\nI love the concept of Whole Foods and the range of options given. Being a vegetarian/vegan, this is one of the few places that you can come for a whole range of options. The produce here is always great. Plus,I also enjoy the smoothie bar and the pizza that they will put in a to-go box for you.\n\nHowever, there have been 2 times now where I have had lackluster service, sometimes even downright rude. I have come to expect this at lesser stores but not at Whole Foods. One male cashier that we had did not even acknowledge us the entire time he was scanning our items, but instead told awkward inside jokes to his friend who was bagging our groceries. He didn't talk with us through the whole transaction and after the bags made their way into the cart, he shouted \""Later!\"" like a surfer dude and resumed chatting with his BFF. This is no way to treat the customers of your store, especially when we drive WAY out of our way to come here.\n\nYes, I returned even after the aforementioned experience, thinking it must be a fluke.\n\nSo...yesterday we went and AGAIN were treated rudely, by guess what? The SAME GUY. This time he was bagging the groceries and did such a poor job that my husband had to stop and re-do it himself on our way out. He was in such a rush that he couldn't bag our groceries properly.\n\nIt's too bad. Please fire this man. (Curly, blonde hair). He is terrible and gives Whole Foods a bad name. I will be going to the new one on Camelback from now on."
1,"I actually found this place.. through a menu left on my door. Usually I throw those away on the spot.. but I do have an interest in different Asian Style foods. So i gave it a try. I was very please with what I ordered the first time.. which was duck wraps and curry noodles. I didn't know what to get so I went with what I like and I was pleased. Since then I have ordered from this place a couple more times. I have tried a few different dishes.. the delivery of the food is always hot and comes in about 30 minutes for me.. \n\nUpon reading other reviews I will be ordering again and trying the recommended dishes. Give it a shot. Its good stuff. \n\nP.S. I was a bit more than slightly impressed with the fact that they remembered that I am one of only 2 people in my housing area that orders from them.. it was nice for the recognition. The young lady that answers teh phone is very cordial and helpful. I'm just saying.. it's nice to get good service, even on a take-out order!"
1,"*4.5 stars* (because I was hung over the entire weekend)\n\nThis is the place that did me in during my bachelorette weekend in Vegas...  why why why did I have to take that last shot???  (OK, my fault but still!)\n\nHot vibe, expensive drinks, fun times and a fantastic view of Vegas, baby!"
0,"This place should be ashamed of itself.  When it was the Red White And Blue, we liked it, people were nice, food decent.  This place is what I would have to call \""abusive\"".  Abuses your wallet, abuses your body.  The other restaurants at Mandalay are ok, this one is NOT.  Since Vegas has cleverly crafted itself for the new economy I suspect Citizens is top of its class.  They know people need breakfast and lunch, and this is the ONLY reason the place has customers.  Their profits come from over charging for low quality food to a crowd that has no where else to go.\n\nTo sum it up:\n\n- Grossly overpriced.\n- Hash browns = tater tots smashed into a mash.  Good job chef, your the best !\n- Overall food quality low.\n- Your treated like cattle.\n\nWill never return.  Drive to whole foods and stock up if you need a quickie snack or brunch during the day."
1,I love this store for quick visits to stock up on some things I need like produce.  I don't like to shop here for all of my grocery needs though.  Their prices are fair and they have a good selection of meats and produce.  They also have alot of ready to cook meals which are great for if you are in a hurry.  I just wish that they were a little healthier.
0,"So, yeah, the Imperial Palace is inexpensive and it's right on the strip, but nowadays, the other hotels have reasonable prices too.  Get slot cards from all places and USE THEM...  They'll get you good deals too.  But if you don't gamble, and just want a cheap place to stay then Imperial it is."
1,"I'm simple to please. The Jacobs slamming platter is awesome, the omelettes are HUGE, and the majority of the time I order the classic breakfast. The has browns never disappoint, the eggs are average, and the bacon is always crispy (that would be a good thing in my opinion). The service is great, the coffee cup is always full, and the portions are perfect. For me it's nice to see Bible verses around the kitchen and a smile on the face of those who work there. That would be why I keep coming back time and time again. Support this local business and check them out! They will beat any chain hands down."
0,"We went in for what we thought was going to be some good Italian, wrong! I had Speight and Meatballs, It was like being in High School, HORRIBLE! My date had Pork Chop Milanese, dry overcooked and not sure what the spice was but good god BAD!!! The Manager was watching TV doing nothing, going outside? Another bad Italian restaurant! I thought with a name like Mancuso behind it, well you get the picture. I hate to say it but Olive Garden was better, now that's scary!"
1,"Awesome. Just downright awesome.\n\nApparently there can be a huge line here, but we lucked out. We arrived at 9PM on a Thursday evening, and we sat right down.\n\nThis place is a counter where they shuck the oysters right in front of you and cook everything right in front of you with really awesome, high powered steam cookers. The prices are fantastic for Vegas too - $17 for a dozen oysters - NICE!\n\nStarting with the service, Sandra was our waitress, and she was fabulous. She had plenty of suggestions about what to get. We already knew we wanted a dozen oysters, but we weren't sure what to follow that up with. She suggested the combo roast, and we went for it. FREAKING DELICIOUS. In fact, if you're going as a twosome, I think a dozen oysters, a couple beers, and a combo roast is a great meal to share for the two of you.\n\nApparently this place has been around for 19 years.\n\nDo you really need my review to convince you? There are well over 200 reviews of this place, and the average score is 4.5 stars. I think if we would have waited two hours, my review would have only been four stars, but considering that we had no wait, five stars all the way.\n\nNext time I'm in town, this place is HIGH on my list!"
0,"I came into a wealth of free bagel & cream cheese bagel coupons, so I finally got a chance to check this place out.  I'm usually not big on chain bagels, but I'm not going to turn down a free meal either.  I tried to go once before but they close at 5pm on Sundays.  The sign on the door is lightly confusing since it used to read 6 but the bottom left-hand corner of the 6 was obfuscated in order to make it appear as though it was a 5. \n\nI finally made it last week and had a whole wheat bagel with jalapeno cream cheese.  The bagel was on par with the standard bagel you can get out of a bag at the supermarket.  The jalapeno cheese was delicious and the highpoint of the meal. The people working there were friendly and accommodating.  The main hangup was that the worker didn't offer to toast my bagel and, me thinking this would be standard didn't ask, left me with a pretty difficult to eat bagel.  After I took one bite I really needed my water to wash down the dense bagel.  In NYC you could probably eat untoasted bagels since they are really light and fluffy, but this one was a bit tough to swallow.\n\nI feel a conflict of interest when giving them only 2 stars since my bagel was free, but it'll have to remain at 2 until I get my next bagel (also gratis) before the coupon expires."
0,Breakfast did not come out of the kitchen for 25 min. What the F! They do not have the capacity or bandwidth to handle multiple orders. \n\nHere's a tip: Walk to the Aria and eat at the buffet.
0,"I walked into this restaurant at 1pm Sunday 10/27/13. The parking lot was pretty empty and from what I could see there was probably 5 tables occupied. We were greeted promptly by the hostess and taken to our seats immediately. That was the only good part of this visit.  We then opened our dirty menus and my children stated that the restaurant has an odor. I agreed it was a musty smell. We were beginning to be alarmed.  We then sat for owner 15 minutes and watched several  staff members walk by us. I was now losing my patience the restaurant was practically empty. A waitress then stopped at the table behind us and asked them was everything ok with their meal and began to walk pass out table. I attempted to get her attention but failed. About 3 minutes later she was back at the behind us by now we are gathering our things to leave because obviously we wore our invisible suits to dinner.  As my husband is standing she walks over like we were bothering here and states # what do you want to drink?\""  I am livid by now and state absolutely nothing we are leaving to which she shrugs her shoulders and says ok and walks away. As we are leaving the hostess ask if we were leaving my husband responds yes and she ask why he tells her and she apologized and stated she would go get the server if I wanted to which I raised an eyebrow. She then pointed out the manager and I realized he was the guy that had been leaning on the counter in the window the whole time. So he had a perfect view of us and never acknowledged that we were there so I declined. I will never step into their establishment again and from what I saw many others have made the same choice.. It was a ghost town."
1,"We did NOT have dinner here, so I can't comment on that. However, we did stop by here for drinks. We had friends eating dinner here, so just wanted to say hello. I'm so glad we did. The vibe here is amazing. Plenty of attractive people...women dressed up to perfection. It's loud, but not too loud. There isn't actually that much room to grab a drink and hang out without being in the way. However, none of the waiters/waitresses have an attitude about passing through. They very politely ask you to move with an \""excuse me\"".\n\nThe music was bumpin, and some diners even got up and started dancing in the open areas or, like one woman, on the table behind her booth. I was even more impressed with that. Security was on the scene, but just monitored to make sure she was okay. It wasn't like bouncers in the club who get upset and yell at you to sit down. They assessed the situation, saw that she was in control, and let her (and everyone else) enjoy her dance. Again...customer service goes a long way, and they did it right. \n\nOnly minus is that drinks are ridiculously expensive here. I bought a round for 4 people, nothing fancy, and it was about $80. So be prepared, but you'll be sure to have a good time here."
0,Probably the worst nights sleep I have had. The room was nice and clean. A little pricy for a HIX but worst of all was the noise from water pipes (or something) all night long. On and off like the tank on the toilet bowl refilling. Ours did it and above or below was doing it as well. I usually have better results and never have to worry. Unfortunately this stay wasn't as pleasurable.
0,Overpriced and small portions.
0,Alamo is f****** stupid.  I booked a car for Las Vegas to drive back home. But they only accept major credit cards for dropping off at another location.  And because I didn't check THEIR debit card policy on THEIR website (booked through Expedia) they just kept saying I should have looked at their website or I should've booked directly with them.  Well shouldn't you make sure your third party booking sites are giving people all relevant information.  Now I'm in line somewhere else because I didn't bring any of my credit cards.  What a complete waste of my time on my super short trip.  And thanks Alamo employees for standing there and being completely incompetent and pretty much telling me it's my fault for booking through a through Expedia.  You suck.  You too Expedia.
0,"I stop at this location when visiting family in Charlotte. They are zero for two with getting my order correct. \n\nAt other locations, when I have gotten what I have ordered, the food is great.\n\nIf management could get the employees here to pay more attention to detail......."
0,"Well our experience here last night really managed to ruin our week long plans to go there and bowl. The poor service started when I called early in the day to make reservations for a bowling lane. For some reason they don't take reservations, although I am sure many people like myself would happily pay more for the convenience of this service.  However, we continued with our plan to bowl at Dave & Busters. \n\nWe arrived with a group of 7 adults.  After enjoying a wonderful meal elsewhere at The Keg.  One, single member of our group had over indulged and I do not dispute that fact. He was that way before meeting up with us, and the other 6 hardworking members of my group should not have been punished for the one out of control individual. \n\nWe were told that it would be an hour wait, although there were 5 open, unused lanes. We agreed to wait, and grabbed a table at the bar area. Our drunk friend should have been asked to leave upon arrival, and would have been a favor to the rest of us. However, after serving all 7 of us. Yes, that's right, even the obviously intoxicated person, a manger came over and told us that all 3 of the males in my group were cut off. \n\nNow in between my husband had inquired as to how long we were going to wait seeing how there were 5 lanes not in use. Maybe they just don't like their inefficiencies pointed out. Because shortly thereafter the manger came up and made her announcement to our group. \n\nI had listened to her, and when she left I asked the other ladies in my group if I heard her correctly. I could completely see cutting off this one person, but my husband and other friend were not intoxicated or out of control. \n\nI approached the manager and asked for clarification.  She proceeded to use rather insulting descriptions of my husband and friends and told me they were all swaying around and falling down. Again, I agree with one, but I would love to see what she thinks she saw regarding the others.  I requested a refund on all out drinks as we did not get to finish them.  After a prolonged episode she refunded us about $25 for the 5 drinks on our tab which does not seem adequate since at least 2 of those were premium alcohol. At that point I was tired of talking to the unattractive troll (I hate to name call but based on her description of my husband it seems fair) and took my group elsewhere. \n\nWe looked forward to bowling with friends for a week. I regret the invitation to one specific person but I can't take that back. However, I find the treatment of our entire group outrageous and uncalled for. I will NEVER return to another Dave & Busters. I have enjoyed many prior visits but the treatment we received last night terminated any chance of future spending from my family."
0,"huh..... Not the L&L I'm use to in Cali or Phoenix. Maybe it was because of the conditions the employees were in (sadly, their A/C went out) that made their food not quite as good as I expect all L&L places to be. Ordered the same: Kalbi and chicken katsu. Took it to go, obviously hehe. You really cant mess up chicken katsu, which they didnt, phew. Kalbi was not as flavorful nor well done to my desire. Macaroni salad was not as garlicy but yummy nonetheless. Ordered Spam Musubi and there was only one and the spam was more thinly sliced than what I'm use to.They didn't even have the thick teriyaki sauce :( nor the garlic chili sriracha/simbal. Sad to say, I brought my wife to this L&L, her first hawaiian bbq experience and she was not impressed :("
1,Absolutely fantastic product; the grapefruit is amazing. Exceptional good service every time I've been there too.
1,"Came here for dinner on Thursday night at 6:45. Although we had reservations for 5 people, we still waited a good 15 mind for our table. \nAmbience: this place was happening. The vibe is nice, especially on the patio. Clientele appeared more business oriented. Older crowd by far. \nService: mostly it was really good. Out waiter was on top of things. They did recommend a veggie dish that turned out to have meat. That was corrected right away. Water was constantly refilled. Food came out at a decent pace. The waiters recommendation was good. My only issue was that the rib eye special ran out by our 7pm slot.\nFood: overall food was good. I wasnt impressed with the bread (cold and hard). The beef carpaccio was really good. It is def meant to share and came out like a salad. Very good flavor. You wouldnt even know you were eating raw beef. My main entree (since they ran out of the rib eye) was the lamb pops. I asked them if they can have the same accompaniment as the rib eye (lobster mac n cheese and bacon brussel sprouts). The lamb was good and cooked well but only had 3 pieces. I would have liked four for my main entree. The mac n cheese was disappointing. It was mixed in with the brussels sprouts and i couldnt even locate the lobster. The Brussels sprouts were ok. Maybe i should have opted for the sea bass. That got rave reviews. \nVegas has a ton of great restaurants. I would prob opt to try a different one. Its not bad but nothing that stands out."
1,"AMAZING! I had a friend that had a professional bra fitting and told me it would change your life! I made an appointment and she was right! I was wearing a totally different bra size then I measured in the store.  The owner was totally relaxed and friendly.  I'm not very self-conscious, so I wasn't worried about the actual fitting part, but low key.  The store is beautiful! You can really tell Katherine loves what she is doing.  She spent over one hour with me trying on several bra styles.  I purchased three and it was so well worth the money! I feel great and cannot believe I walked around for all these years wearing the wrong size bra.  I would recommend this place to anyone!"
1,"I never knew it was right around the corner, thanks Yelp! My first visit was excellent. The food was fresh and delicious. I had quite an appetite so the three tacos were not enough. Luckily, my wife could not finish her burrito. I am sure we will be returning."
1,"I'm only reviewing the Pets Hotel here, just to be clear. I take my dog here probably 1-3 times a week for daycare and have since she was old enough to go. The staff there is great. They have gotten to know my dog really well and they take great care of her anytime she is there. I never have to worry when I drop her off there-I know Lissie, Cheyennea, and everyone else will take great care of her."

0,"UPDATE! So I received a harassing message from the owner accusing me of working for Yelp, that I should not say anything and not to come back if I don't like them. \n\nMy original review was 3 stars, but as a result, they've been downgraded. Just a few thoughts:\n\n1. OK, I will never come back. Done!\n\n2. If you are really that thin-skinned about a 3 star review where I do say the donuts are decent, but the Thai iced tea was too sweet, maybe you shouldn't be in the business of serving the masses. Hmm?

And, may I assume that this person owns Boston Donuts, given the first (And only) to review, and the 5 star rating?\n\nAnd last but not least,\n\nYes, I am the Yelpy evil donut fairy, traipsing around with my magic wand of misfortune cursing those poor, unfortunate donut shop owners with my 3 star reviews! Muhahaha!\n\nBut really folks, if you don't want to get harassed, go to Bosa or Welcome Chicken + Donuts instead. You will thank me, the evil donut fairy!"
1,"Piestewa (formerly known as Squaw) Peak is an amazing workout. I'll admit it, it kicks my butt a little. But that I like to blame on asthma and the terrible pollution in this city. But seriously, it's a great way to get your tush movin'.\n\nIt's crazy-out-of-control busy on weekends when the weather is nice. Parking is an absolute nightmare. Expect to park a ways away, unless of course you're like me and stalk people with your car...... \n\nAlso, if the sun is up, expect to fry like an egg on hot pavement. Wear sunblock!! As well as hats and/or sunglasses. I've made the mistake of not wearing sunblock and yeah...not good!! But I guess if you live in Phoenix that's a must anyway. Just remember!\n\nIf you're not up for the summit, there are tons of back trails to hike throughout the park. They're easier and usually less crowded. Bring your kids, too, I saw more than several little ones practically running to the top no problem. If only I could do that...."

Called after 20 minutes and was told that 2 shuttles had already been dispatched, and another would be there in a few minutes.  No shuttle arrived.  We ended up paying another shuttle company to drive us to the airport.  My advice?  Don't buy a round-trip ticket!"
1,"Surprisingly nice hotel near Sky Harbor Airport. Sort of reminds me of an upscale European styled hostel with its common couch areas surrounding the lobby, free wifi, kitchen style snack bar where you can pick up breakfast and a fancy coffee maker that does coffee and hot chocolate. There is also a box of varied tea bags. \n\nRooms are spartan but very nicely laid out. A lot of physical and visual textures on the walls, floors and furniture. Very well laid out rooms, sorta like a hostel/ikea/hipster hotel mashup. Everything you need and packaged very comfortably. \n\nTip: When you book, there are special rates found on their website where you can get free breakfast, I would recommend that one. Airport shuttle every 30 minutes.\n\nNOTE: Iron and board are tucked away in a cubbie to the right of the bed if you are facing the bed from the foot."
0,"Not impressed at all.  Went there yesterday (a Friday) with my wife and some friends of hers from work.  The placed wasn't packed yet at all as it was only 5:00 when we all got there.\n\nService was very slow for getting drinks but reasonable for food that was ordered.  \n\nMany apps were ordered including wings, mushrooms, zucchini, chicken strips and the reuben dip.  Reuben dip was pretty good.\n\nMy wife ordered the fish and chips which was good.\n\nReason I gave this two stars is because I ordered the one thing that should be perfect in ANY Irish place.  The Shepard's Pie.  Hands down the WORST I've ever had.  Can't believe a chef in an Irish restaurant would send that out."
1,"I took my 5 year old son here and this place is awesome!! I got a vanilla iced coffee and it was delicious. I am very picky about the quality of iced coffee drinks. This passed with flying colors. I also ordered a buttermilk donut, which was like a little pound cake/slice of heaven. My son enjoyed a chocolate frosted glazed with sprinkles and orange juice. We will definitely be coming back!"
0,"First off, they frisk you for weapons so you know the place is ghetto. Secondly, fat chicks everywhere. Thirdly, bouncers are incredibly rude and power hungry mongers. Fourthly they charge a cover when at midnight on a friday in the middle of summer nobody is even there. Fifthly, parking is $8 dollars. Sixth, there are 3 bars right next door for the same price (cover). Seventh, bathrooms are disgustingly unsanitary. Eighth, there are more cops in the bar than there are patrons. Ninth, there are a lot of creepy old guys, and tenth, again, nothing but fat ugly chicks everywhere.  Overall a terrible experience, will never go back."
1,"We took the ride inside the grand canal we are staying at the Venetain and recieved 50% off  the ride and it was very nice and relaxing, we got to sing that's Amore with out Gandola driver. You must be 52 inches or taller to ride and wear seat belts."
1,"I really like this place. It's convenient, the people are friendly, and the food is delicious. \nWhen I visited Hawaii I noticed that all of the grocery stores that were nearby had poke in the seafood section, and that was awesome. I thought to myself that it's too bad that they don't have that here. \nWell sure enough they do have that here, and it's at poke express. The selection is good, the flavors are good, and if they are out of something they make it for you on the spot."
0,A/C stopped working so I took it in; I don't usually use Sun Devil but they were convenient and I've had a fair enough experience in the past.  They said I needed a new compressor and clutch for just under $900.  I took it to my regular mechanic who said I needed a $5 bolt.\n\nThat's class.
0,"What a sad excuse for a chain that touts its football games and specials on Sunday. I walk into this place about 1:30pm on Sunday and the hostess has no idea who is playing or what is TV. The bar has one person and one table filled. Meanwhile, there are football banners and pennants everywhere promoting the NFL, but they apparently don't carry the NFL package because only the nationally televised game was on their five TV's. Even the staff is wearing football jersey's - well there was a reason it was empty right smack in the middle of an NFL Sunday. What a pretender."
1,"One of the best meals I've ever had!  My friend recommended Craftsteak and I'm so glad that I listen to him.  I ordered the \""surf and turf\"" and the price turned out to be reasonable.  The filet mignon was heaven and all the side dishes were excellent.  The meat was really juicy and tasty.  The service was impeccable and I loved the modern/grand ambiance."
0,"Came here twice. The first time was not bad. Since we were the only customer, we did not really notice the speed of the service, even though it was not very attentive, we figured it was kind of the attitude of the place. Food was great though.\n\nThe second time we came back, thinking it is a decent place to get a bite and recommended to our friends to come here for lunch, was a mistake.\n\nThere was a swing dance type event, however, most people seemed to be ordering drinks. And there were lots of empty tables. So we figured that there should not be too long of a wait because we were all pretty hungry.\n\nIt took 20-30 minutes just to get someone to attend to us and take our orders at the bar. The staff taking our orders were constantly distracted and very slow.\n\nWe waited for 45 min then found out we had to go to the bar and ask for our drinks. None of them were made or served without us continuously asking about whether our order was getting made or not. \n\nAfter we finally got our drinks, we entertained ourselves at the play area that has a ping pong table and couple of other games, but after another hour, we were running out of patience.\n\nWe waited 2 hours for our food, and the last person that ordered waited 2.5 hours, which is after everyone had already finished eating. Again, the food was great, but the service was not very attentive. It did seem like they were a little under staffed for the crowd, but still... there was not a real good system for getting your food or drinks after you have ordered, especially when the music is blaring. Your \""nick name\"" was called over the muffled speaker for you to either pick up or someone from the staff \""might\"" bring it to you, if they know where or who you are. I'd recommend checking periodically to make sure you did not miss it if you go.\n\nThe food got 4 stars, when we finally got them but the service was so bad that I had to take two stars off. And the food was not really worth the 2-hour wait, especially when the service was really little to none during the wait. \n\nIt really was sucky for us because we paid upfront when we ordered and even tipped, and finding out later that we weren't really going to get much service at all, we regretted that we included the tip.\n\nMy advice for this place, make sure they are not busy before you decide to go there hungry... or if you have hours to kill and not super hungry, not a bad place to hangout if you do not expect to be serviced.\n\nI want to like this place~ Unfortunately, given this place two tries, we will not return again, due to lack of service."
1,Great stone crabs in dinner buffet. Great selection. Great apple cooler. Try the salmon. Bad pasta and pizza. Bad sushi.
1,"I originally came for the pizza, which is excellent, but I keep coming back for the Italian dishes. O am glad I went out on a limb one night and ordered something other than the great pizza. Now I usually just order the evenings special with confidence that it will be great.\nDon't miss out on the homemade cannoli. They are addictive!"
1,"This was alot of fun and a great way for me to check out many places in Old Town that I have never been. Lindsey had us partake in a scavenger hunt armed with a map and clues to find various places. I love that she started us at Orange Table (I had a mimosa) and end at 5th and Wine. \n\nMy personal favorites that I visited (and had never been) were Fashion by Robert Black (the most incredible vintage finds), Outrageous Olive Oils (still thinking about the truffle oil), Art of Merlot (bought a gift certificate to return) and 5th and Wine. \n\nThe only reason I rated this 4 stars is that I felt like there were too many places to find if you wanted to win a prize. In a period of 2.5 to 3 hours, Dolores G and I went to so many places and were exhausted! And then we didn't even come close to winning! lol. I don't care about that but I would have LOVED more time to spend in the various business without feeling rushed to compete. But.....I do feel like this shopping crawl introduced me to some new places that I really like. I would do again, all day long, but probably not be compelled to compete for a prize and rather leisurely explore."
1,We drive all the way from Summerlin to see movies in style here. \n\nThe Luxury+ seats are comfortable and take the stress out of finding a good seat and getting there early. \n\nThe popcorn quality here is MEH.  The dining options around in The casino is MEH.  (Not at fault to this movie theater - restaurants close at 9PM.)\n\nThe comfortable seats and reserved seating are worth it. Ticket prices are less expensive as well and much appreciated. \n\nThis is the future of movie theaters. The competition should be taking notes.
0,"Short and sweet : \nService was fine WHEN the did come around.\n\ncoffee was luke warm at best.\nMy thai salad was soggy and had the heat level of a lighting bolt being shoved in my mouth.\nMy wifes \""hard poached\"" eggs were harder and dryer then hard boiled eggs. \n\nThere was only a few customers in there but the food took so long you would have thought they were slammed. \n\nMy recommendation would be to go to the buffet. Or the little caf\u00e9 across the casino floor from it."
1,"A ton more low key then the firefly on paradise, but the food is just as good, the drinks are just as good, and the prices as always are the best, its just a much more toned down crowed, so If you want the up beat aura then hit up paradise, but if you want to sit back, have some good food, and make fun of your friend for totally striking out with the hot hostess, then try this firefly"
0,"Had the absolute worst service here today.  Straight from the Amy's Baking Co handbook.  As a former regular we will never go back.  Our entire table was flabbergasted at the treatment we received, it was embarrassing.  There are plenty of decent breakfast places with great service in the area that will gladly get our business in the future.  Not this place!"
1,"Brought the kiddos here to check it out and found that they really had a wide variety of activities. My daughter loved the art area, the big climbing tower and the little pretend area (store, ice cream stand and kitchen). My son enjoyed the toddler room and the shopping area (mainly pushing the carts!). Facilities were nice and clean and it wasn't super crowded. I felt it was a bit pricey ($11 per person) especially since there was no adult vs. child rate as I've seen in other children's museums."
0,Worst Wendy's ever.
1,"A note to the owners of Cupcrazed: Your staff are overriding the brilliance of your product. For a company that has something great to brag about as this place does, the employees seem dis-interested and completely unmotivated. \n\nHaving arrived two hours before closing, and similar to other reports, the chairs were upside down on the tables sending a clear message that closing can't come fast enough for the employees. There was no ambiance as there was no music at all. I am only giving four stars because of the product, but the customer service and atmosphere is completely lacking. \n\nThis establishment has SO MUCH POTENTIAL which is a shame when they have credentials that other establishments could only dream about (winning the Food Network's Cupcake Wars: \n\nhttp://clclt.com/theclog/archives/2011/09/12/cupcrazed-cakery-in-fort-mill-sc-wins-food-networks-cupcake-wars\n\nIf this place is to thrive and if it's going to win my loyalty, it must treat their customers better and provide an experience that matches the notoriety of their product."
1,"Great food, but the place is freezing cold, and no one seems to be able to change the temperature.  Nice waitresses and waiters too!\n\nPresentation can be improved particularly on salads.........stop taking a small piece of salmon and cutting it in thirds!!!\n\nClean the window ledges when you clean the tables.  Don't just toss debris on the ledges!"
1,"I recently stopped at this location to get some work done on my car before an 800 mile road trip. I had a pretty unique problem with my air filter and I have to say I am extremely satisfied with the service I was given by Jason and Brian. They came up with a solution to my problem, and gave me a full inspection on my car pre-roadtrip (which turned up a nail in one of my tires). What they charged me was quite reasonable and if I ever need car service in Las Vegas again I will definitely be back."
1,I love this place. I've eaten here 4 times now and it is very good every time. They have a huge selection of drinks and a crazy amount of things to put on hot dogs. I love the family feel in this place. Definitely the best place to stop for lunch for a hot dog.
0,I had the Pollo fundido ... The chicken dry as the desert sand and had a similar texture. The beans were nasty and the rice way over cooked and mushy. This was a sad state of affairs..
1,"10.16.10\n\nIndoor dining with outdoor feel.  Located inside the Forum Shops at Ceasar's, Trevi was a pleasant surprise.\n\nYou know the deal.  You partied hard the night before.  You lounged by the pool a bit when you woke up.  You walked around the strip.  Now you're finally realizing you hadn't really eaten anything all day, and you're ravenous.\n\nTrevi to the rescue.  With hearty carbs, you're sure to curb your appetite.\n\nI had the margherita pizza ($12.95).  Thin crusted, cheesy, melt in your mouth delicious.\n\nLike!"
0,"The chile relleno--the standard by which all Mexican food restaurants should judged due to the difficulty in preparation--was soggy with a bland ranchero sauce and stuffed with cheese that quickly solidified into a chewy slug. Stick to the tasty mole sauce, which covered some dry chicken stuffed enchiladas."
0,"Was really excited to try this place out. The decor was adorable and the service was pretty good, but found their food to be just okay. I tried two different tacos, one was okay, but the jerk chicken was awful. I even asked the waitress if it was in fact jerk chicken and she said it was and I told her I didn't like it at all. I didn't even it and mind you one taco with nothing else is $5. She didn't take it off the bill, which shows me they aren't interested in customer service."
1,"I like this place. It is quite authentic and I know authentic, trust me.\n\nOkay, they have some of the funky things fo the Western palate, but they have geat Clams, steamed fish, ox tail soup, and fried frog legs. You gotta be geat to have this stuff, and this place is one of my favorites to go to when I can't make it downtown.\n\nLots of Asians dine here, which means it is good."
1,"First of all, you have to go to this restaurant for the entertainment factor.  Nobody goes to Disneyland for the great hot dogs right?  You go to this restaurant for the fun factor.  \n\nThe food is a bit expensive for what you get, but considering the experience I'd honestly pay double.  They only accept cash, they offer wine in an IV bag and cheap beer straight from the 24 ounce can!  The food is very basic: hamburgers, hot dogs, milk shakes, fries, beer, and cheap wine.  If you weigh 350 pounds or more, you get your hamburger and fries for free.  When you walk in the door, you are \""checked in\"" to the hospital with a hospital admission wrist band and a hospital gown.  All of the staff are very pretty women dressed as sexy nurses.  The sexy isn't over the top, so there were a lot of kids there.  You're seated, place your order, then your food arrives pretty quickly.   We ordered two of their standard hamburgers (one way bypass) with fries and a PBR.  I think our bill was around $30.  You'll be plenty full after your meal because everything is made without worrying about calories.  If you don't finish your food, your waitress will ask you to move to the center of the restaurant for a spanking in front of everyone with a wooden paddle.  Of course, you can decline.  The waitress prepared to paddle my wife and I yelled \""spank her hard!\""  She was spanked normally just like everyone else.  When it was my turn, the waitress insisted on spanking me 3 times.  I'm certain that our waitress played softball or tennis because she damn near broke the paddle on my butt. \n\nThe manager (I think her name is Tracy) was so nice to us, and chatted with us during our entire meal.  We had a terrific time and we'll certainly go back next time we are in Vegas.\n\nBy the way, this is Vegas.  If you are in Vegas, I hope you have a sense of humor.  It's a town where trucks with billboards drive up and down the strip offering \""girls to your room tonight,\"" the casinos are filled with smoke, and people hemorrhage their life savings every day.  Heart Attack Grill is a nice break from all of that.  It's just basic American greasy food served by sexy nurses who spank you with a wooden paddle if you don't finish your meal.  So, go to the Heart Attack Grill- and ask for Tracie.  Tell her that you want one of her special pina colada jello shots.  Trust me, you'll laugh until you cry.  Get a burger, try to finish it... or don't try, if you're into that."
0,"Don't come here if you have any sort of time constraints. The only reason I'm not giving this place 1 star is because I didn't actually get to taste the food. I came here for lunch knowing that there would probably be a wait. But, I was craving some chicago style pizza, and I had an hour so I thought I'd be fine.\n\nI walk in and stare at the 2 workers in the place for 5 minutes. Finally he asks \""Can I help you?\"" Something about the way he said it just rubbed me the wrong way. It felt like he thought I was intruding upon his precious time. Granted, the restaurant was pretty full, and they seemed understaffed so I just asked for a table. He told me to \""sit tight\"", which I did. I sat tight for at least 15 minutes without anyone paying any more attention to me. An update on time would have been really nice. Even just saying a word to remind me that I hadn't become invisible would have been appreciated. Of course they were too busy running past me to say anything though. After wasting 20 minutes of my lunch break, I gave up and left.\n\nHopefully I can come back and actually try the food. But, the service here is really poor from what I can tell. The pizza better be amazing; otherwise, I don't think I'll be tempted to come back here."
0,"Bad customer service.\n\nServer forget my napkin, he didn't come back to even ask me how's my food. I have to asked the hostess for my check. \n\nNot coming bank and won't recommend to my friends."
1,"Stayed here this past Saturday night for a Steelers game.  I was fearing the worst from the reviews, maybe setting low expectations improved the experience.\n\nThe hotel was great.  Clean, comfortable, decent price, friendly people, free shuttle to and from the game, and quiet at night.  No complaints, i'd stay here again if I was in town for a Steelers game."
1,"This restaurant was suggested to us by the gal at the Roaring Fork, as they were not open for lunch. I had the turkey sandwich, it was like having Thanksgiving between two slices of bread! It was awesome! The staff was engaging, not taking offense to our preoccupation with trying to figure out why some people got white napkins and some got black napkins. Turns out their white napkins are \""linty\"" and they have had people complain, so they give out black napkins to anyone with dark pants on. Why anyone would complain to a restaurant  about lint on their trousers is an entirely different question. This place has great ambiance too. Check it out!"
0,"We had originally made a reservation at Thrifty, but when we got there and were in the process of paying for the car, the agent started rolling off her confusing spiel about how if anything happens to the car, we could be stuck with paying for not only the damage, but the time the car is out of commission, yada, yada, yada, and the insurance to cover this was $17 and change.  She couldn't even explain whether or not we'd still owe anything if there was an accident.  And she wasn't even nice about it.  After my husband signed everything, he saw that the bill went from $259 to nearly $400!  When I pointed out that $259 + $17 does not equal nearly $400, she said that it was $17 A DAY!  Truly, she acted as though theirs was the only game in town and it didn't make any difference to her whether we rented from them or not.  We canceled out the transaction - for which she flat out refused to give us any type of receipt - and then we started looking at the other companies.  We tried Dollar, but then found out it was also owned by Hertz (as is Thrifty), so the deal would be exactly the same.  Then we saw Advantage and decided to give it a try.  For about $100 less than what we would have paid at Thrifty or Dollar, we got a full-sized car which was automatically covered 100% by their Loss Damage Waiver.  Plus the agent at Advantage was so much more pleasant and friendly than that person at Thrifty.  For us, Advantage is the way to go from now on any time it is an option."
1,Great guacamole and salsa. The tacos were great. So much better than La fiesta. Fast and Friendly service. They also have a tortilla maker as well. Pretty neat.
0,"Slowest place ever!!! Had 3 waiters walk by and stare at us without even smiling or greeting us. Took them about 10-15min to come to us. We ordered two drinks and that alone took almost 10 min. We closed out and left. Get it together, that was some BS.\nThey knew we were upset when we left and got stares and no apology. \n\nWill never go back."
0,"Personally I love Red Lobster and have usually had very good experiences or at least at the one in Flint, MI!  My husband and I were so excited that a Red Lobster was going to be right down the road from us.\n\nWe quickly found out that this place had a lot to learn!  The staff was not very friendly and more concerned with socializing than checking on their tables.  Our waitress messed up simple things with our order, did not check on us to see how the food was, and did not refill our drinks.\n\nAs for the meal, the biscuits were dry and old tasting.  I ordered the salmon with a lemon garlic sauce, however I did not know that my fish would be swimming in the sauce.  I was highly disappointed and will not be returning to this location!"
0,I kinda been hating my last experiences here with my child.  Specially when certain employees seem rude and unhappy of working there. Sad to say that it's a certain manager. The salad  bar is pricey for its quality of vegetables. I get a dry bad tasting lettuce every time I go but then request it to be refreshed.  The games almost never work completely but I had no idea they were so old. I'm thinking they don't want to invest in it anymore. Even the smell of this place is kind of odd. I wonder how often the carpet gets washed. To the other pizza place here I come (except for the salad cause it's bad tasting too)!
0,"I hesitated to write this review, but after the past 3 weeks of run-around, all due to Best Buy, I had to share my tale and caution others to go elsewhere to upgrade their cell phone.  \n\nI've purchased many, many things from Best Buy; I'm going to focus on my experience with their cellular/mobile electronics section.\n\nMy iPhone 4 was in need of an upgrade; Best Buy had the iPhone 5 on sale for $50 less than anyone else.  As fate would have it, they even had a few in stock, so I zipped over to Best Buy on 12/26 to upgrade my phone.\n\nI made it abundantly clear to the gentleman who \""helped\"" me that I didn't want to change anything on my service.  All that I wanted was to upgrade the phone, renew my contract with AT&T (ugh, ick, horrible - like dealing with the devil), and keep everything exactly the same as it was.\n\nHe was extremely casual about the event - too casual, in fact, as he spent the majority of his time texting someone from his own phone.  He went about setting up the new phone, clicked away with his mouse, and at every opportunity was using his own phone to text someone.\n\nHe proclaimed the new phone was set-up, and that I'd get a \""welcome\"" e-mail from AT&T.  I asked if I could confirm that my account was left \""as is\"" - he said that he didn't have any way to provide it to me, other than by e-mail.  I asked directly if my call plan, data plan, text plan, and discount were still in-tact, and he said, \""Yeah, man - don't worry, it's all there.\""\n\nI left with my new iPhone 5, and went about my business.\n\n5 days later, I received a text notice from AT&T stating that I had exceeded more than $100 in texting fees.  \""Impossible!\"" I proclaimed, \""I have unlimited texting!\""\n\nThen it dawned on me that I never received the e-mail as promised from the distracted gentleman who assisted me at BB.\n\nI drove over to the AT&T store on the West Side and inquired about my plan.  The person who assisted me there indicated that Best Buy had not carried over my unlimited texting plan.  He also indicated that Best Buy had dropped my voice plan to a lower level plan.  The AT&T store corrected these items and I went on my way.\n\nFast forward a few weeks, and I realized that I wasn't receiving any visual voicemail services.  iPhone users know what I'm talking about - the little push notifications that show as \""badges\"" when you have an unheard voicemail.\n\nI went back to the AT&T store and asked them to check on the issue.  Once again, Best Buy was the culprit - they had dropped visual voicemail service from my plan at the time of the upgrade.  They clearly showed me on the screen that the changes had taken place on 12/26 - the same day that I upgraded my phone with Best Buy.\n\nThe final straw came when I received my bill, and noticed that my affiliation discount was missing.  I called AT&T, and guess what?  The discount was dropped on 12/26.\n\nSo... if you need to upgrade your phone, I'd urge you to do it elsewhere.  In talking with the AT&T store staff, they all shared horror stories from Best Buy customers.  One person at the west side store said, \""We spend a disproportionate amount of our time fixing problems initiated by Best Buy.\""\n\nBest Buy = 0 stars - FAIL"
0,"WORST nail salon I've EVER been to (and believe me, I've been to ALL kinds)!\n\nLas Vegas native now in NY, have gotten nails done all over the US and other countries and I have definitely been to GheTTo ones but this one beats them all!\n\nPlace is unsanitary.

1,"the clarendon has one of the best happy hour restaurants we've eaten in. great fish tacos!\n\nwe spent our new years eve hosted by the clarendon. it was very inexpensive, at only 25 bucks. they hosted a Gatsby theme and luckily, most everyone showed up dressed to the 9's!\n\nthe party was held at their pool lounge area which had plenty of heat lamps and lots of room to move. or you could head up to their roof top patio which has amazing city views. there were heat lamps also. \n\ncash bar and a DJ for the party. it was nice to be able to move about so freely without constantly bumping into other party goers. \n\na couple of things to consider: the rooftop patio is floored with wooden planks with gaps in them. didn't bother me, but i noticed several women in their high heels get caught up several times in the gaps. \nthe DJ was ok i guess, but i did not care for his music. only towards midnight did people start dancing and he didn't interact with the crowd at all. all of a sudden, we just hear \""10, 9, 8,....\"" and that was it. \nlastly, the wine pours. very inconsistent. i believe a drink is 5oz, but the bartender only served us 3oz. later that night, i got a completely full glass. good for me?\n\nbut that's nitpicking. fun night and lots of taxis lined up outside to take you home!"
1,"Dieu du Ciel is my favorite brew pub in Montreal. The beer is amazing and there are always different choices of seasonal beers. The place has its own vibe, noisy crowds and good service. If you need a snack try the Quebec cheese and meet platters."
1,"Have you seen the movie, \""Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story?\"" If you have, then you know what Globo Gym is. This LVAC is the what they would have based Globo Gym after.\n\nLVAC is large and is a beauitful, clean, and well maintained gym. Classes are tought throughout the day (From 5 AM to 9 PM). They're open 24/7-365. There's a lap pool, co-ed steam room, sauna, and jacuzzi. There is an Advanced Training Room (The Beefcake Room as I like to call it). Upstairs there is an indoor running track, about 15 rows of cardio machines (from stairmasters, treadmills, bikes, elipticals, and other machines to get your heart pounding).  There is a seperate co-ed weight room (downstairs there is the Women's Only Gym) and two large class rooms.\n\nThere are personal trainers around the gym (in yellow shirts) that will tell you how to use the equipment and let you know if you are using the equipment properly.\n\nLVAC is awesome and my favorite athletic club in the valley. Definitely come in and try it for a day (which is free)."
1,The revamped peanut butter pie is amazing !!
0,"Mediocre food for the price.  The decontructed tuna roll was good but other than that, I wasn't extremely impressed with the food or the service.  I wouldn't classify this restaurant as a seafood restaurant... it has a little bit of everything in it's menu."
1,"Cool, relaxed, good drinks, expensive.\n\nCool little lobby bar in the Encore with tons of drinks featuring loads of vodkas.  A few beers for the guys offer another choice.  I had a strong stout bottle of craft beer.\nA great spot for before/after dinner drink with a date id you don't want loud music.\n\nThe bar has a cool ice rail that stays frosted for cooling your drink."
1,"came here for lunch. when i entered the rest. i was greeted. the place was pretty large and  busy from about 1-2 pm. i ask for a to go menu. after looking through the menu they have a very large selection from japanese, thai, hawaiian, and chinese food. umm i didnt know how to think about that. i decided to go with the meat jun. which is a thin slice of steak battered with egg. its like an omelet ish. with its sauce. it came with rice and salad for about $7-$8 bucks. Price were not that bad. all about under $10. the food was really good. the staff was also nice too. would def be back !"
1,"Stumbled into this place over Labor Day 2013. Went in around 10:30 PM, it was dead dead dead. Like 15 people & mostly women there.  Having been hand stamped, we left to SKY for about an hour and cheap ($2) cocktails. Then returned to Apollon around 11:30. It was crowded and the DJ was live. Great music (Club / House) - great lighting, thanks to the DJ's \""laser props\"". Cocktails are more typically priced @ $7.  Cute Go-Go boys also. Women were very outnumbered also - mostly all men at that hour. PS - not against women at the Gay clubs, just tire of the \""bachelorette parties\""  showing up at the Gay clubs to make a fool of themselves & fawn over the gay boys. (Yes, they were here - complete with the wedding veil !)\n\nFun place, but don't get there much before 11:30 ..."
1,What a nice piano bar!! Prices are pretty good for drinks and you get to listen to live music..they will also play any song on request!!!!
1,"If you like Filipino food you should try this place.  I ate here several times while I was in Chandler. There are so many dishes that are good here and I don't even know the names of most of them.  What I did, once I saw how it was, was to go in after 6pm when they put almost everything on half price to move it out before they close and I just pointed to about 4 or 5 dishes like I was going thru a buffet line and get the smallest container of each item (except the pancit which I really love and get a bigger size of) and took it all home and eat it for the next 3 or 4 meals.  The chicken and pork were both good.  This is not low-calorie stuff so be forewarned it will fill you up!"
0,"Horrible service, inedible food, tremendous swivel factor. But, my drink was fine.\n\nTheir advertised drink specials are good, but most concentrated on shots and low-end liquors (think Smirnoff for $3). The \""service\"" at the bar was hard to come by, although there were at least two bartenders working.  I asked for a minute with the menu, and spent the next 20 minutes trying to flag down a bartender to take my food order.\n\nOrdered the shrimp special which was not very special at all.  Although there were 6 grilled shrimp that were actually pretty good, the rest of the plate was a mess of flavorless, watery rice pilaf and a virtual stalk of broccoli, steamed but otherwise unadorned.  At $12.99 it was definitely not a good value.  Plus, it took for-ev-er to arrive. The gentleman next to me ordered the meatloaf special, and his cafeteria-style serving arrived in about 30 seconds.  That didn't make me very happy for him, however, as it looked equally disgusting.\n\nI cannot recommed this place for anything other than a drink, although the pool players seemed to be having a good time."
0,"We used to love this place for the chicken tacos. Something has changed, there was not much meat on the tacos and they didn't taste the same.  One of the tacos had only about a tablespoon of chicken in it. When my husband showed them, they made him a new plate, but stuck the taco back on it without adding any meat. We won't be back."
0,"I was in Las Vegas for work and I wanted a quick take out Italian meal. I ordered the Fettuccine Alfredo and mozzarella sticks from the online option on Yelp. I arrived and picked up the food and noticed the shop was kind a cool \""old school Italian deli style\"" The guy behind the counter was nice and gave me my food and I was off to the hotel.\n\nWhen I opened the M.Sticks they appeared to be your garden variety frozen cheese sticks. I tasted them and confirmed there was nothing special here. The marinara sauce was tasty and really salvaged the cheese sticks for me.\n\nNext I opened the Fettuccine Alfredo the portion was huge and it looked good but when I tasted it it had little or no flavor. It was like eating a frozen dinner. Fettuccine Alfredo is one of my guilty pleasures but this was not worth the calories.\n\nSorry I will not be going back here."
1,"i love, love, love the high level of customer service that paul and his staff provide at central car care.  i recommend them to all my friends.  good service, nice people, great prices, reliable.....  what more can you ask for?"
1,"The original BevMo in the valley, if memory serves me well here.  Selection is better than some of the other locations and service has never been a problem for me.  Convenient location not far off the I-10 on the north side of the road."
1,"Takamatsu is near and dear to my heart because my husband and I came here on their grand opening....and, we've been coming back ever since. The manager is super-friendly and he's at the restaurant almost every night. In fact, we have only visited Takamatsu once when he was not there. He greets you, remembers your name, comes to check on you during your meal-- excellent service without being over-attentive. \n\nThe food at Takamatsu is just down-right good Korean food. My best friend is Korean and I have traveled around Korea myself, so I feel that I know a bit about the range and diversity of Korean cuisine. Takamatsu has all the Korean favorites including bulgogi (the Korean bbq) that most Americans crave. As a vegetarian, I recommend the bi bim bap or the kalbi dolsot bibim bap without the beef (substitute tofu), the japchae (it's actually a Japanese dish), the bibm naeng myun (ask for no beef), and the pa jeon (ask for no seafood). The great thing about Korean food is that they bring out these little dishes of yummy pickled veggies and other things before the meal. These are on the house-- so, it's like you get a free appetizer! (Vegetarians watch out for some of these dishes b/c some are fish cakes). Plus, they bring you sweet persimmon tea on the house when your check comes. How good can it get?? The dishes sizeable and are well priced. The dining room is not fancy, but is comfortable and pleasing.\n\nI feel that some of the low reviews for Takamatsu stem from two things. #1. Most Americans are not well-acquainted with Korean food. It is not like Chinese or Japanese food-- it tends to be spicy,generally has less fat than Chinese food, more fat than Japanese food, and utilizes a wide range of ingredients. #2. Some people only try the sushi. Most Korean restaurants have sushi, but it is NOT what they typically specialize in. If you want to see how good the restaurant is, try the Korean dishes-- that's what they do best."
0,"Friendly and professional staff, room was nice but I had problem the first night with the smoke alarm malfunctioning which woke me up only after being asleep for four hours :(. The front desk was called and I was informed that maintenance would not arrive until 8:30. Issue was finally repaired around 8:45am. \n\nThis was an issue because the type of job I'm in is supporting third shift and now with no sufficient sleep my day was going to be extra long, in fact I did not arrive back to the room until 4am. \n\nI enjoy soaking in the tub, but discovered that the bathtub is not really designed for an adult, very uncomfortable to use.\n\nI will continue to stay in a Marriott property but when visiting the phoenix area I will be patronizing a different property.\n\nBy the way, I did receive a 15.00 discount for the alarm incident, thanks Fairfield Inn but this was not good enough. :("
0,"High prices, bad neighbourhood. Food tastes good. But with the money i spent, could of want to the buffet instead...."
1,"Friends had gone on our last trip to LV and I was elsewhere. so I went with them on this next trip.  They loved it and I have to agree..it really was a nice place, cool scene but relaxed.  The food was excellent.  We had like 12 different tapas and sangria.  Really everything was pretty cool.... Definitely hitting it again next time.  With Tapas everyone has their favorite type of food so tough to say whats best.  we ordered all different types and they were all really good"
1,My friends and I have been shopping around for a new tattoo shop after having a bad experience at one in particular. We went in for consults at Ritual Addictions and wer welcomed and felt listened to. We'll be heading down there in the coming months for new ink for sure! The shop looked very clean and there was a good varity of artists to choose from.
0,"Hands down the worst Subway I've ever visited. Not sure if the other reviewer works at this location or not but service here is consistently sub standard.\n\nI've visited this location 3 times as it's closest to my house and not only is the service bad, but the portions of meat, cheese, and toppings are always skimpy, or you need to beg and barter for normal portions.\n\nThey honestly weighed the portion of cheese once to argue that they provided the accurate amount. Of course it came back light but what happened to the customer being right? We're talking about 10 cents worth of cheese?\n\nDo yourselves a favor and drive the extra half mile to the next closest Subway. Or, visit the chinese food place next door as it actually has great service and food"
1,Been coming here for a few years now & wouldn't trade it for the world!! Awesome service but most importantly AWESOME ICE-CREAM
0,Slow night. Service slow. Tap ran out. Saw 2 other customers leave due to no service. Another guy came up to the bar and said he's been waiting 10 minutes with no service. I waited long enough where I could only get a beer and not food. Had a 10:45 flight. Fly out of clt all the time. I'll stick treating in b or c wings.
0,"Came here for a very special occasion.  The prices are high and it's in the Wynn.  My expectations were high - as they should be for a place like this.  Unfortunately, it did not meet my expectations.  One of the worst $120+ meals I've had.\n\nThe best part of the meal was the Basket of bread - Keep it coming!\nThe show was good, there's a show every 30 minutes.  We watched 3 of them and they were all different.\n\nCons:\n* Halibut - Way too dry.  Had to keep drinking water to eat 1/2 the meal.\n* Lobster Bisque - Way too salty.  Again, water saved the night.\n* Swordfish - Tasteless and boring seasoning.\n* Wine pair - Sucked, the servers didn't have a clue on what was good to pair the dishes with.  We sent back the wine twice!\n* Slow service"
1,"Prices went up.  Still a good deal on the Strip, but not a super good deal.  This makes me sad :(\n\nOh, and the pizza is still yumtastic."
1,"Took a while to get a hostess to seat us; maybe she was on break. But on a busy Saturday night, they should've had the front covered... When we were finally seated, Niamh, our waitress was phenomenal!\nWe had corn fritters for our appetizer; I liked them plain, no sauce, so you could taste all the delightful flavors of corn and the breading. \nFor dinner, shepherds pie of course! How could you go wrong? And, mmmm it was full of meaty goodness!\nMy husband had fish n chips with a side of bachelor's peas. I tasted a bite of everything and must say that I enjoyed the fries the most! (I'm a fry kinda gal!)  But he just loved the bachelor's peas and wants to try making them at home!"
0,"Ok this is hard for me beause the food is 6 stars.  I take my friends, family, clients here and everybody raves about it ..... but.  The smart ass kids at the counter have got to go.  I don't know their names but  one in particular should retire and become a lawyer because when you ask if you can have your sandwich on Italian (roll) instead of focaccia he says \""Focaccia is Italian\"" and then looks at you smugly.  I took the high road and neglected to point out to him that a baguette he offered was French.  He should  pay less attention to geography and work on his note taking skills because after all that, the sandwich still came on a focaccia.\n\nSo I hope the owner hears this, your front line of sales at the counter makes me want to go somewhere else.  Your six star food, averaged with your zero star staff puts you at a 3.  And yes Guiseppe, I want to drink diet coke and I don't need a lecture on how it has \""echemica that is a bad for your brain\"". If you feel so strongly about it, then don't sell it !  I'm sure your meats contribute to heart disease but you're not grimacing when I order a porchetta sandwich (which is unbelievably good by the way)\n\nSo Andreloi, please get someone up front with a smile and who, at a minimum, has read a pamphlet on the basics of customer service.\n\nHate having to write this one."
1,"First visit to Vegas glad we chose The Bellagio. Whilst busy, full for the last 2 months, large enough to not feel overcrowded. Having visited other hotels certainly Bellagio seemed to be the best. Ate at Olives and Circo both first class pricey but not exorbitant. If coming to Vegas again definitely recommend here.\nWater fountains spectacular!"
1,"Anytime I can hop on a tram in lucky las Vegas, I'm all over it. This is a  great feature when casino hopping while we stayed at The Vdara. It allowed for ease to several casinos and cut out all the walking I do while decked out in sky high heels. Ladies, you can feel me on this and can appreciate a tram likewise.\n\nNote: Tram ride is free but hours are limited. Route is from Monte Carlo to The Bellagio."
0,"Misdiagnosed the problem. Didn't even seem to want to fix it. Dukes was much more professional, fixed the correct problem and even gave better pricing for the blower motor, which wasn't even broken.\n\nThe worst part is that I know the ac guys tech most likely had a generic relay in his van. And even if he didn't, I'm sure hq has them in stock. We went three days without ac because of the holiday, waiting for a shop to buy a motor from."
1,"Greatly favored chicken, healthy portion size just wish the pricing was more economical."
0,"If I could give zero stars I would. Went there with a party of 8. The lady explained we can only split the bill any two ways with cash/card. This is the most overpriced place I've been to in Vegas and as a local I've tried Laziza, Cloud Nine, Sitara, and some others which are all even far better than this place. The booth is even uncomfortable because the wall that you lay your back against is vertically straight. The lighting is dimmer than most places, music is ok. Hookah flavors are extremely limited and they only allow one hookah to TWO people?! This is unheard of..most places allow up to four people. On top of that, everyone is required to get a drink which is another $8 even bottled water is $3. I'd rather go to Sitara where their drinks are half the price and actually delicious. I've never seen a hookah bill as high as this night..we could've just bought our own quality hookahs and shisha to smoke with the amount we paid. The people only came once or twice to attend the coal and by then it was already harsh. We got our bill and the lady told us we can only split it in HALF when earlier they explained they could split it any two ways...said the computer didn't allow them to. Please do our group a favor and don't ever come to this place. If you want to go to a hookah bar on the strip go to Rhumbar..$65 unlimited smoking and NO limit to how many people per hookah, nice view, decent drinks for the strip."
0,"I do not get the love for this place.   We had to go have another dinner later the night we went here because we hated this place so much.  First of all, it's pretty expensive.  Second, the pizza was so thin and soggy it was awful.  I will never be back here."
1,"Wow,I placed an order here last night and the pizza was to my door in 15 minutes!  I got a pepperoni pizza with a chocolate chip cookie and the cookie's are to die for. Also if you order online there are a lot of good deals going on."
1,"I stopped by the Cheeba hut last week for lunch and had the white widow sandwich. The line was a little long and the place has a real hippy type vibe. Think tommy Chong meets Quiznos.. They have Krispy treats with fruity pebbles, Rice Krispy, and Capt Crunch. Bread is fresh and veggies do not over load the sandwich. And the best part or all is..... They have TANG !!"
1,"Wow, tough to give it four stars, but I am going to do that. I will explain why. Beer should never be $16 for a draught beer. Sure it is one liter in size, but really who came up with that price? You almost feel obligated to spend it because the smaller beers are $9 so you might as well splurge and get the full Bavarian experience.\n\nSo why 4 stars? The food. Let me tell you after spending five years in Germany and knowing what Bavarian food should taste like, it is spot on. Really rich and authentic. I had the Cheese Plate appetizer which had American cheese on it, but don't let that bother you, it was done well and you get the same plate in Bavaria anyway. \n\nThe Bratenteller is a mixture of Pork and beef with red cabbage and Spatzle. Authentic in every way and so good every bite was made with some sort of noise like umm, yumm, mmm, etc. \n\nEntertainment is good but in my opinion it should be louder. \n\nYou will be seated with total strangers unless you indicate your comfort is not there, but sitting with strangers is the Bavarian way and I met some of the most fantastic people including a family from Ireland. \n\nSo money aside, bring a hundred so you can get just a little of everything and at least 2 beers to get the full effect. This is a great place to celebrate someone's birthday or anniversary or whatever. Just make sure you tell your waiter and they may do something special for you."
1,Really really the best pedi ever! Pho was so attentive and didn't rush me at all! Every time I come to Vegas I am coming here!
1,"The cream Italian ice is amazing. I love the chocolate chip cookie dough and mint chocolate chip. It tastes like ice cream but lighter, seriously amazing. I normally get the gelati which is layered custard, Italian ice & custard."
1,First timer staying here and have to say that their customer service at registration and the central bar was awesome!! They were super accommodating and made our first few moments at this hotel wonderful! What a lovely way to start a vacation.
1,"Consistently praised by food critics and locals, Lotus of Siam is a place that has become a destination restaurant for foodies throughout the world....Congrats Chef Khun Saipin Chutima on winning the James Beard Award for best chef Southwest 2011. A mom and pop restaurant indeed, not!!!"
0,"Great service and nice ambiance, but the food doesn't hold up. \n\nI started with the spinach, apple and Gorgonzola salad, which comes with chicken, and none of the flavors worked right. The nicest thing I could say about the salad was that the spinach wasn't wilty at all. \n\nNext, we had ordered the four-cheese pasta which features broccoli and chicken, and it fell flat. The rich white sauce lacked flavor,and the broccoli looked good but tasted odd. The chicken was completely different from the chicken on the salad - in a good way, but it was still kind of odd. \n\nI could see myself coming back here just for the convenience factor, but it won't be with any anticipation for good food, unfortunately."
0,"After falling in love with the Panera Bread in Mountain View, California, I was excited to see that there is a location in Phoenix after moving here. It isn't anything like I was previously used to...not as good at all. Soup is good, but still seemed watery..I had broccoli cheddar and they do not serve French bread with soup here unlike the other ones I have visited. It was a disappointment. I love panera bread, but sadly, will not return to this one. The quality and service was also lacking."
1,"As Jenny L has reported, we sampled the delights here today.  I knew ahead of time that they only had cakes and coffee (c/o Googling it at work that morning) so was mentally prepared for coffee and cake for lunch, yum.\n\nMiss J (!) has already told you all about the lovely (yet normal) apple and almond cake/tart that we chose as well as the last minute choice of the chocolate, almond and fig tart which SO interesting.  They were both very yummy and I was so glad J was happy to get to two pieces and share so we could have twice the cake joy.  \n\nThe thing with other coffee shops/tea houses/places where you gorge on cake is that they tend to have the same general things.  What is great about the Chocolate Tree is that you can go for the usual muffin or chocolate chip cookie (though theirs was labeled chocolate hazelnut which excited me and is begging me to come back and eat one, or a dozen.  Whatever) or you can go for something completely new and interesting.  \n\nThey have loads of vegan, gluten free and non-dairy cakes as well, which I'm sure some people will be all about but I'll be completely honest with you when I say that, being intolerant to none of the above, kind of bummed me out.  I've never had a gluten, vegan or non-dairy cake which really floated my boat like the ones which have it all.  That being said, I'll give their v/gf/nd cakes a chance because they look sooooooooo pretty, and that's really what it's all about, right??"
1,"Oh Cut, I love you.  I love you because you have the most exquisite vegetarian side dishes and the very best scotch in the world.  \n\nIt's no rumor that Cut gets the best meat.  They get the best meat from LA to NY, at least.  If steaks are what you're after, you couldn't get better meat if you went to the farmer in Japan.\n\nBut here's why I really love you the most, Cut:  for your whiskey.  I love you for carrying the Springbank 25.  I love you for really knowing what you're doing with steak and scotch.  Even though I don't eat steak.  I want to know a restaurant knows what they're doing, and so few restaurants know what they're doing.\n\nCut, I adore you."
0,"I had my reservations with Au Pied de Cochon once I read the yelp! reviews.  Why, you might ask?  Well, when any restaurant has an army of cheerleaders behind it, it worries me.  While I do like a good recommendation, I often take a pause when I hear \""go here or else you will never be happy again!\""  Ok, I ad lib'd that part.\n\nIn regards to the restaurant, we found it quite nice, and the service friendly.  However, I must agree with another reviewer that the balance of the dishes was, well, missing.\n\nFor instance, the menu, by first impressions, does not leave one saying \""I have to have this, and this, and this.\""  While an attractive menu, one does not need a fatty Entree, a fatty main, and a fatty dessert.  \n\nWe did start with a course of foie gras.  While it was creamy, the taste was rather stale, and as such, we wasted about $10.00 worth because we would not eat it.  It wasn't spoiled, but it just wasn't good.\n\nWe moved on to the main courses, I had the duck in mushroom sauce.  It was almost as if the chef said \""no, I will not salt this dish, no matter how much it calls for salt.\""  It was, in a word, bland.  The duck itself was nice, but the flavors did not call out to me.\n\nFor dessert, I tried the poached pear, as it was the \""lightest\"" offering.  It was delicious, but not enough for me to remember my meal at apdc fondly. \n\nAlas, I came, I ate, and I'm not returning."
0,"Go for the atmosphere and to hang with friends to chat over the endless house wine.  For whatever reason my friends get a kick out of eating here, so every once in a while we stop by.  During my last trip in the middle of last month, a bunch of us stopped in for dinner.  \n\nThe food here is just really average.  The decor is cool and the location is really popular.  If you go, make a reservation and be ready for crowds.  \n\nI ordered the Veal Marsala and my veal wasn't the tender cuts of meat that you might expect.  Instead it was chewy.  Chewy veal?!?  Come on...  \n\nI do like drinking the endless house red wine out of the Godfather glasses, but that shouldn't be the only reason to go here."
1,"Postino's is absolutely amazing by all means. I absolutely love this restaurant. First when we pulled up it had free valet parking which was really fantastic in itself. We sat on the outside bar seating and it was really neat seeing the whole restaurant from that angle. I loved the space invader guys on the wall and when they went around putting candles on all of the seating areas.\n\nWe ordered bellinis which were AMAZING! Then we ordered a Hoegaarden pitcher and that was really delicious with the slices of orange they gave us. We also had olives and the bruschetta. The bruschetta was absolutely delicious; we had Brie & Apples with Fig Spread, Prosciutto with Figs & Mascarpone, Smoked Salmon with Pesto, and Roasted Peppers with Goat Cheese. My favorite was the Apples and fig spread or smoked salmon!\nWill be coming back very soon for their Monday/Tuesday special."
1,This is my REI of  choice in the Valley.  Mostly due to its proximity.  But I have been coming to this location since I lived in the wilds of Northern AZ and would make my way into the valley on the occasional escape to socialize.  REI was my decompression chamber of sorts  before I hit the mall and then hit the town....\nFour years later I am back in AZ and actually living in Phoenix and this REI is my goto place to look for everything from quality outdoor gear or practictical quality clothing.
1,"I needed to rent a bike on short notice. Williamson was cheap and their bikes were in pristine condition.  That's enough to sell me on the place.\n\nI went to Madison for a bike trip to the New Glarus Brewery, about 30 miles outside of the city.  Unfortunately, the bike I was going to borrow was no longer available and I needed a plan B.  Within a half hour, Williamson had me set up with a perfectly sized road bike (my request) for $15/day, $24/2-days.\n\nMadison has an amazing, world-class set of bike trails.  Even if you're a local, you should take advantage of the great setup available: rent a top-of-the-line bike and take a spin on the smooth trails of Dane County."
0,"THIS \""SPORTS BAR\"" HAS NO KITCHEN!!!  That's right...a \""sports bar\"" without hot food.  Simply unbelievable.  Needless to say, my husband and I promptly left and went to Chili's to watch the Heat-Celtics game while we waited through a long flight delay."
1,"I know I already wrote a review, but I have to update because I'm SO happy! My last review mentioned that my only issue was their crab puffs because there wasn't enough filling, but we just ordered again this weekend and the crab puffs were packed full! So either we just got a bad batch the first time, or somebody cares to listen. :) Also, tried their egg drop soup which was really tasty and their egg rolls. They have my favorite kind of egg rolls without that weird cinnamon flavor and the extra thin crispy outer shell. \nI'm just so happy to have this place so close with such friendly service."
0,Not a 4 star hotel as described on Hotwire.  Smelled terrible. The staff was lost when it came to reservations.  The cleanliness was not to speak of.  \n\nI will not ever step foot in this hotel again.  Save yourself the struggle and book somewhere else.
0,"This office is terribly unorganized and it's a shame because dr scarff is amazing and I won't be coming here again. They don't communicate with insurance companies and try to overbill. The office manager is rude. There's no communication whatsoever and I think it would be nice to notify someone of a \""past due\"" balance before scheduling them for an appointment rather than letting them know they won't be seen when they show up for an appointment. I have 2 insurance companies and both companies have notified me my bill has been paid. This office will get no more money out of me at all."
1,Tofu! vegan yogurt starter! Seitan rubins! Chocolate! Wild apricots! Most excellent place even if it is a bit pricey. . . We still shop here every week for a small bag of goodies.
1,"Die Falafeln hier sind einfach hervorragend und super spitze, ich gehe oft in der Mittagspause hin und das ist immer richtig gut.\nZudem wird man fast immer mit Freundlichkeit bedient."
1,Really nice place but I don't believe they serve anything other then poutine after a certain hour. Sad because I'm not a big cheese fan but a must visit place !
1,"Can't believe I haven't written a review for one of my favorite cheap place to eat! I have been coming here for years, honestly don't remember how I stumbled across this \""restaurant\"" since it is more a grocery store. The dine in portion is on the side.  My favorite items are kafta sandwich (wrap) and lentil soup. By far my favorite lentil soup in town. $3.99 and $2.50 makes for a semi healthy and cheap meal. Personally I think the beef kabobs for $9 is a little steep because you don't get much food.  \nThis is a hole in the wall type place, don't expect anything fancy (decor or service). But this is a solid spot to eat."
1,Great place to get sushi on this side of town. Servings of the raw fish in rolls and nigiri dishes are above average size. The flavor is amazing. The tiger roll is amazing because the spicy tuna doesn't over power  the other ingredients like most places do. Def recommended.
1,"This has been a staple of the University area for a long time. They have all of the standard Thai fair, and everything I've ordered over the years has been delicious. Lunch and dinner both start with a small bowl of a wonderfull light soup, not salty or overpowering in any way, almost delicate in taste. If you feel like it and it is available order the mango desert, it's truly something to savor, sweet without being sickening and light, but isn't the whole point of Thai cuisine to be light and tasty. The only reason I'm not giving this a 5 star is becaust the mango dessert is not always available ... booo"
0,"I actually signed up for yelp just to review this place. So with that out of the way here is my first review.\n\nI had been wanting to try this place for awhile as I live right around the corner; But, my wife had heard some bad things and refused to go with me. Luckily, I have a friend who is as bold as I am when it comes to taking leaps of faith into dives.\n\nSo, we walked into this place around 2 p.m. on a Tuesday afternoon and the restaurant is completely dead. Excluding a few bar patrons ogling the girl working the bar. My buddy and I continue to stand about for a couple of minuets before we're told to seat ourselves, at which point we get away from the bar and seat ourselves in the back corner of the dining room as to dodge the lingering smell of something burnt plaguing the eating area.\n\nWe get our menus and our drink orders are taken. After taking a look at the menu I was fairly excited as all of it sounded delicious. The price point was a little on the high side, but I guess that's to be expected when your restaurant isn't pulling in too much business.\n\nI settled on the fried tender-loin sandwich and my buddy settled on the two meat combo plate (brisket and pulled pork). It took a fair amount of time for our food to come out given how many people were actually eating in the restaurant at the time - about 25 minutes. I was pretty stoked on this as I assumed it meant all of our food was being made fresh.\n\nI was wrong.\n\nThe tenderloin was a massive piece of burnt batter that lined the entire plate, served with old pickles, wilted lettuce, and some questionable tomatoes. My buddy's combo plate literally looked like a plate of dog food. Without going into too many unsavory details, I will sum up the taste of our food with two words : utterly terrible.\n\nThe cowboy beans that can be chosen as a side are probably one of the worst things I have ever eaten. It was the equivalent of grabbing a handful of ash out of a campfire and stuffing it into your mouth. The texture was right there as well - just complete mush.\n\nAll in all, this is a terrible restaurant, complete with terrible food. I won't even  touch on the barbecue sauce. As I'm sure you'll know to prepare for disappointment after seeing how it is treated on the table (read: POORLY). The only saving grace of this place is the staff, as they're attentive to a certain degree."
1,"Amazing service, pizza was on point  VERY satisfied customer. Large pep, sausage and bacon"
1,"Definitely get a paddle. That's the coolest part about Beertown. You can try four new beers that you might not have even heard of before. Each paddle glass is also small enough so if you don't like one, you're not stuck with a whole pint. Be adventurous!\nAside from the paddles, they also have a very large selection of beer on tap (as you'd expect from the restaurant's name). Don't ask the waiter or waitress what they have on tap ;)"
0,"One less star for every piece of hair I found in my bowl of fake Bun Bo Hue.   Found a total of 5 but yelp requires me to rate at least one star. Besides the HAIRS, the broth was greasy, and unflavored.  Every ingredients I tried to add to make it taste better  was useless....USELESS!!!  They took it back and gave me a new one and still made me pay for the meal of hair that I had to eat!"
0,"So, their IMAX is not a full IMAX screen, yet they charge the full IMAX price.  We just saw Interstellar. If you go, bring a blanket. The movie was 2:45 minutes. We froze the whole time making the experience miserable. \n\nGo to Harkin."
1,"Great Food and Good Service. The vegetarian lunch buffet is a bit meager but sill enjoyable. I will say their bread(its more like Ethiopian nan since i can't remember what its called and I'm too lazy to google) has a VERY strong sourdough taste to it.  I'm not a big fan of that, but maybe thats normal for where the owner is from. But, its the first time I've had it that sour.  Their lamb is amazing though. Give it a try and they do have take-out as well."
0,Went there and was blown away by how terrible it was. I went on a Friday night with some friends got our drinks quickly then it took forever to get an order put in. I tried the back porch platter. on hour later when I got my food it was not the correct order they gave me brisket instead of tri-tip  Which I pointed out to the waitress and she said she wasn't sure but she would check and that was the last we saw of her until 30 minutes later when we got our bill. we couldn't even get anything else to drink. My ribs were such dried out boot leather that I had a hard time sawing through them with the steak knife that they brought out with my friends order. If I could give no stars I would. There are a lot better places in the valley for both service and bbq.
1,We came to Hokkaido after we couldn't get a table at Ohjah.  It was refreshing to be seated right away because I was starving! It may sound shallow but that's one of the reasons why I like Summerlin there are like 3 hibachi places in close proximity.\n\nOur chef was fun ...he was more fun after we gave him a couple shots of sake..LOL The food was awesome! Everything was done like a typical habachi show. The difference that I liked was on the shrimp he put what resembled Mayo and Siracha . It was tasty! I also had some flavored sake but was willing to try this children's soda they have there. It looked intriguing on how you open it. I think you have to push a metal ball down the top in order to open it. I know you must think I'm easily intrigued...I am sometimes.\n\nWe had the tempura ice cream to finish our meal. It was a wonderful ending to a fulfilling meal! The atmosphere isn't as rowdy as some hibachi places. It's a nice relaxing time where you don't have to yell to carry on a conversation.
1,First timer! I had to try 2!\nI ordered the Totally Green Smoothie which is so refreshing and has just enough sweetness (green apple & kiwi). It's my first time having anything with Kale & I think it's delicious! Definitely something I will try at home & have again when I'm in the area. \nMy second drink I wanted a yogurt blend & chose the Get Up and Goji. It's like a nice refreshment at the beach. Light & tangy & sweet with the lil fullness of yogurt. \nOnly reasons I didn't give 5 stars were:\nThey only offer 1 size & it's $5 a drink. \nThe place is small & loud. \nCustomer service was ok but not great.
1,"Great market. I work downtown so this is a convenient stop before heading home. I can find what I'm looking for here, including bulgur wheat, pita bread, labne, molokhia, bamya, and more. I've bought some delicious chocolate wafers here as well. Don't really check out the produce or meat department, but the pita bread is fantastic, fresh, and frugally priced. Comes in white and wheat and two sizes: small for .79 and large for .99. Always busy with people when I go but I've always found a parking spot. I usually don't take a cart or basket and regret it when I'm trying to carry all of my items to the counter. Don't be like me, grab one when you walk in."
0,"I had lunch here with a coworker who had been there before and recommended it.  Neat concept, explained by many other reviewers so I won't rehash it.\n\nThe prices are reasonable, nothing over $9.95 on the menu unless you add extras.  I ordered the Verdure which has Roasted Eggplant, Zucchini, Red & Yellow Peppers,  Mozzarella Cheese, Pesto, Spinach.\n\nMy coworker ordered Pasta, the Ravioli Ricotta e Spinaci which is Ravioli With Spinach And Ricotta Filling, Tomato Sauce.  His Pasta was made before my Panini, but only by a minute or two.  \n\nThe Panini seemed a little on the small side, but was enough fill me up.  The house salad was nothing special.  Iceburg lettuce with shredded carrots and some tomatoes.  The didn't ask about dressing, so I am assuming there is only the house dressing which is an Italian. \n\nMy Panini tasted OK, but it was not grilled long enough.  There were light brown grill marks on the bread and the veggies inside were cold to luke warm and the mozzarella wasn't melted at all.  I should have taken it back and had them grill it more, but since my coworker already had his meal I decided not to because he would probably be done with his meal by the time I got my sandwich re-grilled.\n\nI probably will give Vapiano's one more try and get the pasta or pizza next time to see it is better.  If you are heading here for a Panini, skip it and try somewhere else."
0,"$26 for all you can eat RICE? ---Cool. Not! \n\nGet the heck out of here with all of that rice you try to stuff wherever you can. \n\nI can no longer recommend Jjanga as a solid spot for AYCE sushi. Their quality and credibility has gone down. Waaay down. They used to be decent but, man, I was utterly disgusted on our recent visit. \n\n- Their AYCE (all rice) nigiri are soaked in an offensive chemical tasting \""yuzu\"" flavor\n- Their (rice) rolls are literally all rice and a dot of imitation crab with a paper thin sliver of dried out salmon\n- Watery-bland-miso-soup\n- Sinewy, dried out, paper thin fish\n- Skimpier than a mofo \""special sashimi\"" poke salads, that all have questionable, stringy, bad cuts of fish\n- Oh, they also don't do half sized rolls so be prepared to Tetris the shit out of your food\n\nNo can do. This is not the spot for AYCE sushi or value. They are drastically inconsistent, which is why I am confidant in awarding them with a 1 star review and never plan on returning.\n\nPro tip: Try Sakana on Maryland Pkwy, Las Vegas - they don't skimp on their rolls or their nigiri (plus their yuzu actually tastes good)"
0,"Compared to all you can eat korean bbq I had in Seattle, the food quality here doesn't even come close to it. And it's expensive ($22/person, OB beer $5.99)! I have tried other korean bbq places around vegas and other asian restaurants, the food quality is rather disappointed here."
1,"Aaah, build a bear.\n\nAimed at kids, but secretly, its pretty pleasing for adults too.\n\nStaff are possibly the friendliest, happiest people on earth. They are always eager to help, or have a chat and a joke - but I guess that type of happiness comes from working with teddybears and children all day.\n\nThere are a huge amount of bears to choose here - everything from traditional bears to girraffes and everything inbetween, and also some cartoon characters such as Hello Kitty etc.\n\nOnce you choose your bear you can choose to put a heart in it (not before making a wish!!) and then the fun bit - a bit, whirling, tumbling machine full of bear guts! Well, ok - its stuffing for your bear, but they let you fill your bear up and its possibly the most fun thing ever!\n\nOnce you have gotten your bear, you have the choice of dressing it in a huge selection of clothing - and I mean a huge selection. Thankfully, at this point my girlfriend took over and she dressed her bear, but obviously I had done the fun part.\n\nA decent bear with all the trimmings comes to around \u00a330, but I think its worth it - especially as a gift for a child."
0,The worst steak I have ever eaten. Applebees has better steak. This place was absolutely terrible. The prices are extremely ridiculous for what you get. Go out of business already.
1,"We stopped by Little Italy on our way home from Laughlin, NV and I have to say this place was amazing.  We had the gourmet pizza, and aside from it being huge, the topping were fresh, the crust was awesome and the service was great.  If your travels ever take you to Gila Bend definitely stop by Little Italy."
1,"Delivery was fast and the pizza was great. If you're going to order pick up just know that there isn't a lot of parking. Other than that, the place was great. Highly recommended."
1,We went here for breakfast at 4:00 AM.  The scrambled eggs & wheat toast were extremely tasty.  One of the best breakfasts I've ever had.  A definite must try if you are staying at the hotel.
0,"Ahh, nothing beats the scent of body odor, cigarette smoke, and beer on a beautiful Sunday afternoon at Walmart. Hey, we can get these free smells at almost any Walmart. \n\nOnce you have been to one Walmart you have been to them all. Cheap prices and everything you could ever want to purchase all in one place! Rock on! \n\nHaving said that, this Walmart's layout is pretty bad. Everything is scattered around the store, and it is so hard to find what your looking for. I think they want you to wander around aimlessly with no sense of direction. Of coarse the only people who actually work at Walmart are the cashiers, so good luck finding someone to point you in the direction of the hand soap section. \n\nSadly, there are other Walmart locations that are better. (Did I just say that?)"
1,"It's yet another Michael's, and it's a very good one. Recommended always. For those who love crafting, Michael's is a godsend."
1,"Food was great, generous portions, they piled on the entrees, despite the to go box already pretty full. Good to see. Didn't see any old lady maybe that's why."
1,Great food. A bit pricey even for Vegas. The sangria a were not the best we have ever had but not the worst either. All the tapas were really good and unique. Prepare to spend some cash.
1,"Finally found a top notch old school type feel barbershop with V's. Great atmosphere, lots of tvs and reading material to keep you occupied while you wait. Alex, would highly recommend him, executed exactly what I was described I wanted in my haircut, and it turned out great. Love the hot towel shave as well. Very reasonably priced too for the fantastic service you're getting. Won't go anywhere else now!"
0,"Wet n Wild, how you please yet disappoint me all at once. Am I happy you're back, well yes. Am I disappointed in your lame attempt at a return, very much yes. The best way to say is like this, if you never experienced the old WnW, you'll love and appreciate this attempt of a water park. It has a nice handful of fun rides, a big wave pool, and a decent lazy river. If you experienced and grew up on the old WnW like myself, you'll be very let down, however have hopes for what's to come. (Expansion expected) 2 feet less deep in the wave pool (5'10\"" compared to 8) smaller lazy river, smaller derastuka (which is now called canyon cliffs) and HORRIBLE FOOD OPTIONS! Honestly had the food been better I may have bumped them up a star. Not only was it disgusting and overpriced, IT WAS YOUR ONLY OPTION!!! Burger, hotdog, pizza, or chicken fingers. I bet you're thinking, \""oh I better pack a cooler\"" we'll think again! No outside food allowed!!! What?!?! We can't bring sandwiches and Gatorade? What the F$&! Wet n Wild?!? Biggest mistake yet! I truly hope that rule gets changed ASAP! It makes no sense to not offer more food if we can't bring it! I read a few people excited about Dippn' Dots. Well don't be! They were closed for all but 1 hour of the day. \nI'd say this place is ideal for ages 8-15. But still it isn't an all day event like it use to be. We could have knocked it all out within 4 hours. I most liked the rattler ride. It's a big tube that seats a group, goes up walls, and shoots you out fast at unknown directions. However I will bring up the massive unorganized staff. We rode this ride 3 times in a group of 5, before we were told by a lifeguard that it only seats 4. Another group in our large party of 12, went down with 6 people and were never stopped. There were a lot of groups experiencing this same issue. Walk all the way up stairs to find out you've been doing it wrong the whole time, who's taking the walk of heat back down?! The Zip, Zap, Zoom was wack. Wait in a super long line for a basic tube ride that's over in 20 seconds. If you spend the time in line, wait for the Zoom (green tube) it's the fastest. The half pipe ride looked cool, wouldn't know it was broken. The employees had no answers to any ?s. Like why rides were broken or shut down, or why it took 5 minutes for a medic when someone faints. The staff is literally a bunch of untrained 16 year olds probably working their first job. One question took calling 8 supervisors before we received an answer. \nAnother negative was the lack of rental tubes. If you rent tubes you can use them for the rides. If you don't rent tubes you can steal them from someone like our party who had 10. Literally 2 people took off with 2 of our double tubes and no one did anything. I also had to stop many kids, and older siblings from plotting to steal our tubes! We literally hid and watched them try to take them. One person asked, then got an attitude when we wouldn't let her have a tube. We are not the rental station, nor was it our fault they sold out. If they had enough employees, tubes, food, drinks, ice cream, oh and water, we wouldn't have a 2 star review. But lack of everything?!? If you had the 50 million it took to build this place, you should have made sure you budgeted out running the place too. At least next year we have cowabunga bay. \nDon't get me wrong, I had fun. But kids will truly have fun not having to worry about things like being over-crowded, under-fed, and you know SAFETY!! Watch your youngins close, because no one else is!"
1,"Love this place!!!  My husband and I always sit in the bar area...great, friendly service! They have, by far, the best margaritas I have ever tasted...and I think the food is one of the better Mexican's in this area.  The fajitas are delicious and way more than enough for 2. I would also like to add, that I love the decor! And its always busy...it has a following of locals, and that is a great sign!"
1,"If you're looking for a more chic/upscale Mexican place and not wanting to deal with the strip...\n\n*Great Mexican place for Vegetarians\n\nThe service was very good and prompt. They tell you about the specials when they give you the menu - they had 4 additional options that night.\nFavorite thing about this place - Margaritas. They use Agave, silver tequila and lime juice...so simple but it's my favorite. \nThe salsa and guacamole is ok. The salsa doesn't have a special taste nor did the guac. I love spicy guac or to have the option at least. \n\nFor dinner - \nSweet Chipotle glaze shrimp tamale. LOVED this! I loved the spiciness of the red sauce. Very good sweet/spicy mix and very creamy corn for the tamale.\n\nSkirt steak - Anytime I can get arrachera, I will do so. This was a very good dish with a side of sauteed spinach with onions and jalapenos. I'm not sure how long they marinade it for, but arrachera usually has a ton of flavor in it. This one was good and tender, just not as much flavor as I'm used to. \n\nMy friend had one of the specials - Pan seared scallops on a bed of rice pilaf. It also was very good. The scallops where very tender and not rubbery tasting like a lot of places around here serve. \n\nOverall, I liked this place a lot. I think it's a lovely modern setting for a nice date or a small group of people with good food and drinks."
0,Seriously? I order a drink and the waitress wants me 2 finish my 1st drink so she doesn't have to make my 2nd and give me a clean glass? Alrighty Then!
0,"Yawn. In need of a facelift and some sprucing up. Cheap, for sure, but you get what you pay for. And for just a small percentage more you can get much more for your buck. If you've got kids, it's probably ok. But the amenities, food, drinks, rooms are all pretty boring if you're going to vegas for fun and glitz and glamour."
1,"Japonais is sort of secluded in the middle of the Mirage casino area. interior decor is really nice. we came for happy hour before the Cirque de Soleil Love show. \n\nthe hh food was really good. our party of six picked several different appetizers, calamari, lobster rolls, spicy tuna, etc. all delicious. total bill was under $200 which included drinks. 3 rounds. \n\nthe decor is put together real well. you almost can't tell that there's a casino on the other side of the curtain. very wizard of oz like."
1,I've tried a lot of their chicken. I love their fried chicken wings. I've checked a lot of places in AZ and is hard to find some. I would take Li's chicken over Churchs anyday.
0,"Rooms need to be updated but location is very nice. However, DO NOT answer the call for completing the survey of your stay for 20 percent off your bill. SCAM!! Our bank informed us of fraudulent charges of 2700.00."
0,The people that work at this location hate their lives and the people they serve coffee too. I have never had a good experience here.  Zero stars if I could!
0,"Not for me. Typical college bar with typical prices. That said, if I were a freshman in college with a fake ID, this would be ideal. I would find somewhere else if you are older than 21 years old."
0,"Terrible.  Overpriced and wet nachos supreme.  Bad service.  The nachos were full of lettuce that was dripping with water.  This caused the nachos on the bottom of the plate to become saturated and inedible.  Have you ever heard of a salad spinner?  Complained to the waiter, but he didn't seem to care - basically said, \""I'll just go ahead and file that complaint away\"".  Well, that was just my experience.  Not going back.  Good luck Cuco's."
1,I shop here all the time! The staff is very friendly and the store is clean.
1,Started going here last year when my previous guy was unavailable. Sean and Polo are the best. Best haircut I have ever had. Not even close...You will not be disappointed.  I recommend making an appointment.
0,"I don't like their flavor selection.\nI just don't\nCompared with other froyo places nearby, this one is my least favorite flavor-wise."
0,"The three best things about Jersey's are: (1) the free popcorn (2) live bands on Friday and Saturday (3) and no cover charge. Unfortunately the bands are almost always lousy. They hire such bad acts I suspect that management lowballs the salaries for the bands. Count on the bands playing classic rock. It's not that I hate classic rock if it's done right, but I grew up in that era and get tired of hearing classic rock played like beginner garage bands (the kind of bands we used to laugh at when they screwed up Aerosmith tunes). \n\nSometimes I go to Jersey's just to find out how many pitiful bands there are in the East Valley. In case you are wondering -- there are endless numbers of lousy bands and they all play at Jersey's! Considering the voluminous number of great tunes that were made from 1960-1980, it's surprising that the bands that play at Jersey's have almost identical playlists (AC/DC, Aerosmith etc.). Maybe the owners of Jersey's provides a list of songs that must be played because they think that's all aging boomers want to hear. \n\nJersey's has a small dance floor that is not used very much, perhaps because the bands aren't very inspiring or danceable. Sometimes five or six ladies will do freestyle dancing by themselves while men sit around and gawk. From what I have seen none of the ladies know how to swing dance but several of them know how to wiggle their hips. \n\nJersey's is designed so that people can sit around and watch the dance floor (which is good) but there is rarely any dancing that is worth watching (bad! bad!). \n\nThe floor is glazed cement that hasn't been refinished in quite awhile. Most people there don't know how to dance so the condition of the floor is probably not noticed. If Jersey's ever wants a good dance scene they need to put in some wood flooring and hire some bands that play something worth dancing to. \n\nThe draft beer selection is nothing to brag about but they do have a good deal on Guinness. \n\nBasically Jersey's is a neighborhood dive that people hang out at because they don't have anywhere else to go. With a few upgrades Jersey's could become a major hangout in the East Valley, but I suspect none of the necessary changes will happen anytime soon."
1,Great customer service. They  have alot of different things to eat and snack on. I like the fact they  have healthy snacks and real juice. They  are fairly clean and have lots of options for me to eat
0,"Seriously the worse food for Mexican food. Food was either too salty or too bland. Order the \""Wet Bean/Cheese Burrito\"" and 12 rolled tacos. Burrito was horrible assembled and the red sauce was way too salty. The tolled tacos we bland and the guacamole was watered down. I know I don't come here for the service cause it sucks. Lady who took my order was rude, horribly representing service. Food was priced OK but they charge extra to use your credit card and if you want refills on your drinks. \nFor this type of food place, I would totally recommend to go to Don Tortaco or Tacos el Gordo. Way better price, service, and quality."
1,"Sprecher's restaurant just opened off greenway blvd. They serve the well known Sprecher's brand of beer and root beer.  I ordered the 8 oz fillet mignon with house salad, sprecher's beer cheese potatoes and grilled asparagus. \n\nThe house salad was everything I was looking for with mixed greens, bacon and some cheese. The croutons were even delicious. \n\nWhen the steak arrived I was expecting the sides to be along the sides of the plate but was surprised and actually impressed tontine they had made a nice layered arrangement out of the items i ordered.  Presentation was great and the food was outstanding. They use a wood fire grill which gives the steak an amazing earthy flavor. There is a sweet brown 'juos' I suppose it would be called that comes with it.  The potatoes are like a cheese scalloped but better. \n\n The beer i drank was the heffe and it was quite nice and in large quantity for 3.50 during happy hour. \n\nFinally for dessert I got what they call a 'mini' creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e for 3$. Thisnis actually a pretty good sized dish much larger that the bite size I was expecting.  It was not overdone and tasted great. Seriously a steal at 3 dollars!"
1,"Used Sheets VIP for planning my best friends 30th birthday celebration for 4 full days in Vegas, couldn't have asked for a better experience. Sheets personally took care of everything and made sure we were taken care of 100%. We never waited in any lines to get into Vegas's hottest nightclubs and dayclubs and had the time of our lives. Best thing was I didn't have to hassle with setting any of it up myself, I just explained the kind of trip/experience we wanted and Sheets took care of the rest, all we had to do was show up. I will definitely be using Sheets to plan all of my VIP needs in the future and have recommend him to all of my friends traveling to Vegas."
0,We decided to check this place out since it looked like a casual dining spot and was close to our hotel. My sis and I weren't too hungry so we ordered the fondue pretzel dippers which I do not recommend. We had thought it would be a soft pretzel but they turned out to be those hard pretzel sticks you can buy at a cvs. Gross. Also the accompanying cheese dip was too salty for my taste. Giving this place an extra star only because our waitress was nice
0,Not impressed. I'd rather have a Big Mac and fries at McDonald's. Can't understand why some rave about it.
1,Was on the way out of LV. Sat at the bar. Ordered the dry aged strip and the broccoli. Really tasty. Nice italian beer that i later discovered had been paid for by the restaurant. Thank you for the amazing experience. See you soon.
0,"I always feel kind of bad giving a one or two star review. I did like Sushi Factory's sushi, but there was something about the place that I can't exactly put my finger on that just will not let me give it over a two star rating. Okay, let's go with 2.5. \n\nWhen I arrived I was greeted by a very friendly hostess and seated quickly. Can I comment on the decor? I don't know, just looked a little ram-shackle to me. Ok ok... I'm not trying to be nit-picky, after all I do eat at plenty \""dumpy\"" kind of joints because their food is AWESOME. But somehow dumpy + place that is serving me raw fish = me weirded out a bit.\n\nI did the AYCE with my date. He was all hype about liking sushi though, he wouldn't even touch the sashimi I ordered, but instead insisted on all the fried little concoctions. One of our rolls completely fell apart when we tried eating it. Date didn't seem to care, but I was a little peeved.\n\nThank goodness they brought me out sake to begin with. I think this soothed the bad experience. \n\nDon't get me wrong, it's a decent little place, I just don't think I'll be going back considering there are much better places in the valley to get AYCE sushi."
0,"DONT BELIEVE THE HYPE\n\nOK so the reason I came here was because of all the reviews and honestly this place is not all that. First of all you have to wait for an 40 minutes or more to be seated and the service is very slow.\n\nOnly thing I liked about this place is the hurricane roll (The extra star is for this roll). The fresh was not as fresh as some reviewers said.\n\nOH and because we were sitting thing there and talking with friends with have not seen for awhile, mind you this is shortly after we paid the bill, they asked us if there was anything else we needed kinda their way of telling us to get the eff out because there were people waiting. I am sorry but if we were at any other place, they wouldnt make us feel that way. \n\nThey are never getting my business again. Get a bigger spot!"
0,You may think that because is nordstrom at Chandler  mall you will get better service? Let me tell you that no you won't. I'm here at the Mac store and I been here playing with the foundations and no one has come to help me. Finally after 15 min a girl with her blue eye liner with no name tag on and Hispanic look came and ask me do you need something. I said yes I need help to find my right color and at the same time she was talking to her coworkers that she wanted to go to brake. So I said oh I got this with go take your brake and she left hahaha oh and  the other 2 didn't came to help me  I saw a different girl tall with dark hair and ask her for help since she just finished with a lady but she said oh yes hold on and she let and ask the other two shorties to came and help me
1,"This place is pretty yummy!\n\nI came here bc my friend wantef some enchiladas. Here you get 2 for 4.99$ with any meat. I ordered a chicken burrito but it looked gross so the girl was such a sweetie and let me get something else. Instead I ordered 2 potato tacos with cheese and a kids meal with chicken taquitos for my son. After paying I heard a man ordering some carne asada fries and I was like \""hold up!\"" She said its on their \""secret menu\"" so I got an order of those.\n\nMy friend said his enchiladas were good. My sons taquitos were also very very good and he loved the chips and salsa. I tried my potato tacos and I was like YAY! They were super delish! The carne asada fries (7$) were also very yummy! The only thing that sucked was they dont come with guac, its 1$ extra and also you have to like yell over the glass thingy.\n\nAll in all the food was yummy and cs was awesome!"
0,"Three strikes and you're out. This was my third and final trip to this Roberto's. Tried the carne asada nachos this time. They spent less than a minute getting my order together. The carne asada was dried out and tasteless, the cheese was not melted, the guacamole was plopped carelessly into one corner, and the rest of it just plain sucked. Wonder if anyone checks out these franchises for quality? Do yourself a favor and pretend this location doesn't exist."
1,"Awesome! The service was fast. It was efficient. The team was careful with my car - even wiping down the wheels after installation. However, the number one reason for this review is the service. I purchased a set of four new tires for my vehicle. After driving for a few days, I was sure that I had a tire issue - not sure if it was the tire, balance, etc. But I could feel it. I returned to the store, explained my issue - and admitted that it was very, very minor - but I was very picky. The Mgr took the vehicle for a test drive and he couldn't feel anything; however, instead of dismissing me - he said he was going to rebalance the tires. And he did - and during that process, he discovered that the issue wasn't the tire - but the wheel. Minor - but he did find it and suggested a repair. Yes, I was very pleased with the service."

0,"Left directv after increasingly poor customer service. Lately, I got a different answer about future end dates every single time I called cust service. I'm done. Got Cox today and I love them. Goodbye, DTV. Forever. You had the chance to make it right and gracelessly passed."
1,"Let me first note that the sushi was a 5/5\n\nI got the sushi dinner. 7 pieces of nigiri and your choice of either tuna roll or california roll (could make either spicy for no additional charge)\n\nThe tuna roll was typical, but was a pristine example of what a standard tuna roll should be. Rice packed nicely, quality tuna. I asked for the spicy sauce on the side, I wasn't crazy about it but that may be my general feeling towards most spicy sauces.\n\nThe nigiri pieces were perfect. The rice was the perfect consistency and size (bite size) the cuts of fish themselves were much more generous. The rice was actually similar to that at uni, but the pieces were larger, and no accompanying sauces. Every piece was exceptional, and the entree itself is quite a steal at $20.\n\nThe chicken satay was good, but standard. I did particularly enjoy the pickled carrots and jimica served along side. The satay sauce itself was quite good, on the sweeter side, and not much heat. \n\nThe sweet and sour soup was also very tasty, a subtle heat so that you know you're eating something spicy, but no real burn or anything close to unpleasant.\n\nMy dining companion chose the vegetable pineapple fried rice. It was tasty but nothing spectacular. More ore less a mound of rice with some broccoli, egg, cashews, and large chunks of pineapple. Good, but I wouldn't go out of my way for it. A savory meat added to the dish may have made it quite a bit better though, and I definitely wouldn't object to having it as a side to an entree.\n\nThe tables at the restaurant are a bit closer than I feel comfortable with. There are about 2 feet between yourself and the next table. I could hear the conversations on either side of me in full.\n\nOur waitress (Stephanie I believe) was very knowledgeable and accomadting.  She did not rush us in the slightest, all I could ask for from service.\n\nCliffs:\nSushi is fantastic, and sushi combo is a hell of a deal\nother sampled dishes are good\ntables too close\n\nI'll definitely be back."
1,"Breaking off from the AYCE adventures... This place has incredible ratings and reviews. So. DUH I'm gonna try it.\n\nGolden Ocean Trout, which is made with POP ROCKS on it. AMAZING!!!\n\nShrimp, Octopus, and Tuna Tostadas. Sooooo good. All of their tostadas are made differently. Extra variety!\n\nBaked Mussels, not the best overall taste I've had, but the mussels themselves were fantastic.\n\nOctopus Nigiri and Spicy Scallop Handroll were delicious. The Firecracker Roll was good. However my most favorite... Was that damn Crispy Tuna Roll. Holy crap.\n\nCucumber Salad, Miso, and Toban Seafood Soup were nice little side dishes. The chef also provides a free sashimi dish... You'll just have to find out what ;)\n\nBut.\n\nTo top it off? Dessert.\n\nGreen Tea Tiramisu. And Green Tea CREME.BRULEE. Jesus.\n\nNo really. Just Jesus.\n\nThe service was awesome. Very nice waitresses and waiters. Didn't get personal with the chefs despite sitting at the bar, but the atmosphere is super friendly.\n\nVerdict? YE!!!!!!!!\n\nComing again, soon."
0,"I made an appointment with Carl over a week ago. It was initially at 3:00 p.m. and I called the same day I made the first appointment and asked if they had any earlier openings. He said he could get me in at 11:00 a.m. for a cut and color. I told him that was perfect and let him know I was in a wedding that day. \n\nI got there 10 minutes early and let them know I had an appointment with Carl at 11:00 a.m. Fast forward to 11:20 a.m. Still waiting. I asked the receptionist to see why no one had come out yet. She checked and said he would \""literally be out in 2 seconds.\"" Fast forward 10 minutes later. Still waiting. So I left. \n\n5 minutes later my phone rings and its Carl. He asked if I was ok and informed me that he should have made it more clear that he was doing me a favor and fitting me in since I had switched my appointment. Really? You have the nerve to blame me for  your poor time management?? I switched my appointment over a week ago and you suggested the time, not me. \n\nWont be back. Ill spend my 250 bucks every 4-6 weeks elsewhere."
1,"Delicious chopped salad. You Must order this salad!! It is the same as citizen public house but waaaaaay better. I'm giving 4 stars instead of 5 only because I think the menu could be better. It has staple items to order which it does amazingly like the mushroom dish, the chopped salad, and a few others but overall options are limited. \n\nI prefer it for lunch personally because of the chopped salad."
1,"love their red velvet pancake! but the place is kinda small, we have to wait for half an hour. service is good and the food, i guess the wait is all worth it."
1,"I have been to House of Tricks on a few different occasions, during different times of the year, both for lunch and dinner.  All three times I have been impressed with the food.  This is a place I feel comfortable being a little more adventurous than usual as everything has been delicious.  \n\nThe patio is amazing.  You completely forget that you are only steps away from drunken college students and the main drag of bars.  I swear, this patio somehow transports me to a different place until I walk out of the gate and remember where I am.\n\nThe only \""eh\"" part about House of Tricks has been hit or miss service.  The very first time I went, our server was absolutely terrible - not even greeting our table for about 15 minutes (and no, this is not an exaggeration).  On the visits since then it has been much better (although it was very easy to improve from the low bar set the first time).  There have been a few instances in which I wish my server was a little more attentive but overall, not too shabby.\n\nThis is definitely a place I will return to again and again.  And order whatever catches my eye, because I know it will be delicious!"
1,Gorgeous and peaceful courtyard to enjoy a quality cup of coffee!
0,"Thou shalt not covet thy neighbors server.  \n\nI was so guilty of this.  As I sat there looking for my server I watched the super server who had what seemed like the entire restaurant as her station.  It seemed like every employee in the restaurant checked on me.  except my server.  If I waited for her to bring me some more iced tea I would still be looking.  No silerware.  No smile. No \""how is your burger\"".  No \""thanks for coming in\""  \n\nI felt like she was an ex-girlfriend I ran into at some bar somewhere.  No eye contact, minimal conversation, every thing was just really tense.   \n\nFood was a little disappointing.  The bun was soggy and the paddy just fell apart.  The presentation looked like it was a tossed hamburger.  Everything just kind of landed on the plate.\n\nOn the plus side the ice was cold and I got billed the correct amount.  (eventually)\n\nDon't think I will be back."
0,"Maybe I should have had the fish!\n\nMy friend and I stopped by for a quick bite and a rest from the Black Friday shopping frenzy. I had the carne asada tacos and a Mojito and she had the chicken tacos w/ a Margarita, we were both disappointed with the quality of food. The chicken was dry and bland, the carne asada was more like a thick medium rare steak chopped up into pieces, soooo not - what I was expecting. The rice and beans were okay but the chips and salsa were the savior of our meal. The Mojito could have been better, it was strong and not enough mint. Don't get me wrong, I love strong drinks, but I am not looking to get drunk of one drink in the middle of the day. The Margarita on the other hand was \""delicious\"".\n\nI am liking the decor, it's like a place you would see in Miami or anywhere by the ocean. They have a few walls that are garage doors with glass, I am assuming they will open these up in the summer. \n\nThe service was excellent and since they have only been open a couple of months, I am definitely going to keep my eyes open on this place, I think or hope they will improve their menu."
1,"I've been to most of the clubs in NYC and most of the clubs in Vegas. XS basically says \""All Your Base Are Belong to Us\"" to the other clubs, and obliterates then elevates my standard of what a club experience can be. \n\nYou will be spoiled. There will be debauchery.  I've only been once in July and used to wonder what all the fuss was about...now I know... It is indeed fuss-worthy.\n\nSo, cover is $50 which IS a lot of money for a frikkin club, but if your staying in the Wynn/Encore or get in touch with promoters, or are a bunch of hot Asian girls,or of course know somebody, you can skip the line and might even get admission waived. Girls work it - guys...I guess your other option is buying a bottle $$$. Luckily my friend got us to skip and we paid $40 I think.\n\nAnyways, the crowd is gorgeous, the venue is seductive and intoxicating in more ways than one, there's gambling in the back (which amazed me! i mean gambling in a club while your getting drunk off your ass? Nice move, Encore! I mean, thats fucked up, but nice move!), the music is tight but the drinks start at $14 which adds up quickly...\n\nIf you are a baller, you will live the life here. Girls will grub off you and your cabana like there's no tomorrow. But likely you'll be kissed, then dissed and won't be missed LoL. But meeting someone genuine in Vegas? perhaps better luck at slots! Even if you're not flying sky high you will still feel like a stunner here with a few drinks in your system - the feeling of euphoria here is palpable and highly contagious.\n\nI think this spot is a cut above Surrender if you are out to have a wild night. Whatever - the point is - best. club. ever."
0,"Clean room and bathroom. The bed was comfortable. Now for the bad experience. Unless your a member you'll have to pay an arm & a leg for your room. We checked in with no reservations at 5am cause we were road tripping it. Manager gave us half rate for the room on the first day, ok cool. Second manager charged us a \""early departure\"" fee which 1st manager failed to mention, we had to leave a day early. Policy is a 24 hr notice prior to leaving. Great. Arizona also loves it taxes. You pay the states and the city's then are charged a day 'city taxes'. This place is just as bad as cali. So rule of thumb. Reserve a room or be a member. Oh, & you have to pay extra for Internet access unless your a member. Place is a joke. Holiday Inn next time."
1,"Dominos has gotten really good in the last few years. \n\nYou're saying, \""Five stars? For Dominos? C'mon.\"" \n\nNo, you come on. Their pizza's good, it's fast, it's affordable, and their customer service is spectacular. Is it Spinato's or NYPD? No, but Spinato's not open late, they're way more expensive, and they don't have an awesome online ordering system.\n\nFor economy pizza delivery, it's basically the Hut vs Dominos vs Papa John's. Out of those three, my favorite is the big D."
1,They have a great happy hour and the staff is awesome.
0,"I know better than to eat here, it was great back in the day, but now the 3rd generation is running the place.  And I'm sure there hasn't been any upkeep since then, the place is dirty, run down, staff is rude.  \n\nI had the carne asada dinner last nite, and within 10 mins of leaving I was sick.  That's it for me, I won't be back.  \n\nBTW, don't go in the bathrooms, they were really dirty."
0,"Caveat: I don't drink coffee (gasp!) so I'll be commenting on every aspect but that. Read other reviews if you want to know how the coffee is.\n\nThe biggest selling point of this place is that it's open late. Yes it has free wifi, but forgive me for being underwhelmed, considering that pretty much every coffee shop that doesn't have a green logo does. Even then, their obnoxious password system resulted in problems getting the wifi working on my iPhone.\nThe indoor seating arrangement is odd, which has left me feeling uncomfortable if I don't get one of the few seats I like. The outdoor seating is nice, but you won't last long in the evening if you dislike smoke nor in the day if you dislike ducks.\nSome fools who go here see fit to feed the ducks, which during the day results in ducks coming to you begging for food and crapping nearing your feet. And god help you if you kick them way, you'll have to suffer the disdainful looks of the high school girls who often congregate here.\nThe various non-coffee/tea drinks I've tried aren't good. They're usually just a blend of ice, some sort of syrup or soda, and (depending on what you order) milk. A little fresh fruit, or frozen fruit, or any sort of 'real' ingredient, would go a long way. Instead they seem concerned with making these drinks as cheaply as possible.\nThe baklava I only tried once, since it tasted like it had been sitting out way too long. It's possible I just had some on a bad day, but I won't be ordering it again unless I'm really craving baklava.\nMost of the baristas are friendly, but a couple are real pr*cks who will wipe the smile off your face if you interact with them. I've also been harassed about ordering quickly, even in situations where the place is relatively empty. Sorry if I don't want to order and have my ice melt before the rest of my friends arrive!\n\nAs I said, the primary draws of this place is that it's open late and (for indie types) that it's not Starbucks. But as far as I'm concerned, that doesn't excuse the crappy non-coffee drinks and occasional unfriendliness I've experienced."
0,"I was really unimpressed by the quality of the food, especially for the price! It wasn't bad, but not somewhere I'll be going again."
1,"Very fun place!  Vegan ice cream is such a novel idea, and they do it well.  I had the chai tiramisu tSoynami and my sister had the almond oy vey.  It was my birthday, so she let me swap with her because I liked hers a lot better!"
0,"Thoroughly disappointing. First time here. Uninterested and boring staff. Came to watch football playoffs and there was barely any volume so I was able to hear the table behind me chew their food. Seemed like a lot of regulars. Good beers on tap was the only redeeming factor I could find. I ordered the \""Tangy Buffalo\"" style of their \""Best Wings\"" it came out and I had to send them back because I didn't think there was anything on them except for a pool of grease under them. When they came back they were just a little more doused in greased \""sauce\"" than the last but just as flavorless. The waitress did not not seem to care in the least. These were worse than Hooters mild sauce. They need to shape up but because of the good draft lineup I may give them a second chance."
1,"THe LGO grocery is quite unique.  You walk into the front and you see a menu with breakfast items, sandwiches, pizzas, and incredible desserts.  When you turn the corners, you run into a lot of cool trinkets, unique snacks, soaps and lotions, and much more.  The prices are a bit unreasonable, but that is expected of a store that is within a nice restaurant.  I think the rosemary raisin almond crackers looked the most interested that was within price range.  My eyes were glued towards the wine as well.  I will have to update this review once I buy something here."
0,"We had high hopes as we headed out to Zappone's for dinner. We are big pizza aficionados. We brought our son, daughter in law and grand baby with us. We both ordered the pizza margarita. We were very disappointed. I give them one star for using fresh buffalo mozzarella, but other than that, it was bland. The sauce had not a lick of flavor. The pizza was almost a liquid, melted mess. It had no flavor at all. The crust was probably ok, but without any flavor in the sauce it tasted like nothing. Each pizza was $18, for cheese pizza. I had hoped with all these 5 stars it would be like Pizza Bianco, but alas, it was not. The waitress was very nice and the establishment was clean. That's about it. Also we ordered the Caesar salad. Again, no real flavor at all. Sorry Zappone's. We really wanted to like you."
0,"I feel the need to explain my 2-star rating, because I come here with regularity. Every so often I just jones for an emerald chicken quesadilla, smothered in their salsa. \n\nThe service is hit & miss. There is one particular employee who is awful, the rest are okay - very friendly. But communication is not their strong suit. For example, one day I tried to order a rice bowl WITH a quesadilla. They did not tell me that I can't have a quesadilla with a rice bowl, so I ended up with emerald chicken over rice - no quesadilla. No warning, or I'd have changed my order. They also refused to fix my existing order, they told me I'd have to put in a new order for a quesadilla - no refund on the rice bowl I didn't want. Just today, I put in a to-go order and came home to find they put something... not emerald chicken, I don't know WHAT it is - in my quesadilla. In their defense, they were busy, and I'm sure it's hard to tell what's in a quesadilla. Just disappointing when literally, that is the only reason I go there.\n\nMany people seem to love their fried rice - I don't think it's anything special. Likewise with the beans - they are good, not spectacular. I love the jade red chicken and the diablo chicken. The pork tends to be too fatty for my tastes. The cookies are okay. The SALSA is something special (don't miss it - they put it in a big container by the fountain drink dispenser), I love it and if they sold it in jars I'd probably buy it. \n\nThe good news is that I did find the emerald chicken recipe online http://www.foodieslikeusblog.com/recipes/guy-fieri-dishes-on-tattoos-foodies-and-changing-lives/ (allll the way at the bottom) and I've made it - it really does replicate it well! The bad news is that 80% of the time I'm too lazy to make it myself... so back to Chino Bandido I go.\n\nPS - Every so often... they run OUT of chicken. Really, it's the weirdest thing to me. How does a restaurant run out of chicken? But it's happened 3 times to me here. Since I go there for the chicken dishes, I just leave when that happens. \n\nPPS - I really hope the Chino staff doesn't see my review and muck with my food next time I go... I need a Yelp alias."
0,"So disappointing! \nWe bought a brand new camper at this Camping World. The camper had a pre-existing tear in the flooring (they weren't sure why it was there) and a corner piece of some paneling was lifting away from the entertainment center (from the heat? Idk). \""Not to worry\"", we were told, \""we can replace your flooring no problem\"", we were told. \n\""We can glue the paneling back down, no problem\"", we were told. \nSo we bought the camper and also bought the Camping World's warranty. \nWhile signing our paperwork, they \""fixed\"" the panels with staples... I showed them that there were not any staples on any other panels and now the staples were coming through the opposite side panels inside the cabinets and they even missed a corner of the panel that was still not attached... I should have ran then, but they assured me it was not right and they will fix it.\nSo we took the camper home for 2 weeks to play with it:)\nWe then dropped it off and they kept it for 2-3 weeks , when we come to pick it up our brand new \""fixed\"" camper.... While doing a walk through on site, my husband and I open the slide-out to see all the pretty new flooring, when something under the slide out catches on the new flooring and rips another hole it. \nAlso, that paneling that was supposed to be fixed and \""glued\"" back to TV center, was stapled all around the square! Those sharp staple ends were still sticking out of the paneling on the opposite side of the TV center, with chipped pieces of wood all laying inside the cabinet. As if nobody saw that... Or maybe didn't think we would care. (FYI - staples are not used to secure any other original paneling on the TV center)\n**New list of \""fixes\"": new flooring AGAIN, new flooring that was not extended into the bottom of the TV center (as it was to begin with), shave off screw heads under kitchen table (that was the cause of the slide out catching on the flooring), and try to fix the panels AGAIN (order new wall panels for the original side and the side THEY ruined with staples).\nAnother 2-3 weeks later, we go to pick up the fixed camper (as they told us it was all done over the phone)... The new flooring has bubbles everywhere! Seriously?! Who is your quality manager that reviews all the work that is done?.. Not just a couple bubbles, not all small. Some bubble were more than 6-8 inches long. The paneling that was replaced had been cut too short on 1 corner and didn't fit snugly.. The paneling on the opposite side (that they ruined) was shoved in too snugly and caused the top of the wood paneling to be chipped and cracked. \nSo disappointed in the quality of everything here. I mean I'm really not a complainer and my husband and I are very understanding people. I'm NOT trying to be picky, really if it was maybe one small bubble in the flooring or one side of the paneling was perfect and the other was less than perfect, I might not be writing this review. But IT IS OBVIOUS no one cares about their workmanship here. \nWe then requested to speak to a manager who agreed that the flooring and paneling was not done correctly and assured us he would \""email\"" several people (managers of quality dept., parts., etc) and get back to us for more repairs - I assume. \nSo we had to leave the camper AGAIN....\nWe are making payments on a camper that we can not use. I don't know what to do.\nIt's just POOR quality of work that has completely taken the excitement out of having a camper.\nThis story is to be continued..."

1,Great bang for your buck.  Food and service is better than standard.
0,I've always enjoyed NAPA. They seem to be trying hard to get folks in the front door with all the ads on TV these days. Sorry to say once you go to this location you don't feel welcomed. First I stopped in on a Sunday and the NAPA guy complained about having to work. The pace of their work is beyond slow. They did not have the parts I needed but he said he could have them there by the afternoon. When I stopped back and received the parts I noticed one of them did not look to be correct. The NAPA guy insisted it was the correct part. Well sure enough it was for the wrong transmission all together. I dropped of the part today and again they are soooo slowwww. I'm not sure how a business can run at that pace. I will not be back. There are so many options for parts these days.
0,"I booked this hotel via JetSetter. We were very disappointed. I spent the whole trip telling my husband I TOTALLY dropped the balll by booking this. I actually considered trying to get my money back and checking into another hotel once I saw our room. Where to begin... first of all, the room had a funky smell. It smelled like fried food. It appears that a previous guest fried something in the mini kitchen and it left a heavy smell in the room. No matter how much body splash i sprayed throughout the room, there was no getting rid of this smell. This brings me to my other huge complaint, it was dirty. You can tell that all housekeeping does is switch out your towels and bed sheets and that's it. The floors and furniture were covered in a layer of dust. This is probably why it is impossible to get the smell of fried food out.... because they dont clean anything. I also sat on the couch and it was full of crumbs, as if someone had been eating there and housekeeping never bothered to vacuum. Cleanliness in a hotel room is huge for me. It really is a shame because if they actually up kept the room, it would be very nice, which is the only reason I did give this 2 stars. It was spacious, has the mini kitchen, and a spacious bathroom with a jet tub which you step out of and right into the shower. It also has a beautiful view of the strip, with a balcony (although you cant use the balcony so it might as well not be there). They also did get some brownie points with us because we said we were on our honeymoon and they sent a bottle of champagne, chocolate covered strawberries, fruit and water bottles. Although, this was after I called and complained about the smelly dirty room so i'm not sure if they usually do this. \n\nIn addition to all of this, the Palms is not what it used to be. It is now actually kind of ghetto. There were many groups of kids who seem barely old enough to drink staying in the hotel and yelling and screaming. And for the record we are 26, so we aren't exactly old ourselves. \n\nBottom line, yes it's cheap, but it's not worth saving yourself the money. You also need to consider that it's about a $10-$15 cab ride away from the strip depending on traffic so you will spend at least $25 a day in cab fares. I would have preferred a smaller, CLEAN room on the strip, even if it was more expensive, than this. I went with my husband. The ONLY case where I can see this possibly being a good option is if you are going to vegas on a budget with a group of friends with the intention of partying the whole time and you need a cheap spacious place that fits your whole group to crash in. Otherwise I strongly recommend staying somewhere else."
0,Terrible experience. They're being ridiculous. Rude staff. Pool area is a really sad place. Drinks ridiculously overpriced. Never staying here again.
1,Kids and I have been here multiple times. Love their sandwiches. Haven't had a bad one yet.
0,"Zimbrick BMW has been phenomenal, except for Todd C (a service advisor). I will not go into a long story but the guy has no clue what he is talking about. I would think a place like this would want people to know what they are talking about."
0,"Friendly people, but man, food is marginal at best and seating is not comfortable.  It's like they spent $500 buying furniture for the place.  Don't take your best guests here.  Not hitting the mark for me.  This was my second try, and that will be the last."
0,Unfortunately not good!! Today's visit was the last visit. Just not impressed with how greasy the beef is. Other dishes are ok nothing impressive enough for the price charged. Well... I do like the custard so it might not be the last time.
1,"Our 2 boys are huge meat eaters and were very upset when we told them we were going to Luna's for Saturday night dinner, especially as our youngest hates hummus. We first let them choose a smoothie - that went down really, really well, they are both gym buffs, so \""The Gray Hulk\"" was their choice, they loved it. Then we ordered them the hummus appetizers - knowing too well what the reaction would be - but as soon as the youngest tried it - his face lit up, \""This is delicious - this hummus is fantastic!\"" \n\nWe all ordered different food, all of us saying we were glad we had made the choice because it was amazing. We couldn't resist but order desserts too - the chia pudding was to die for and the cheesecake - it was pure heaven!! \n\nThe food in this restaurant is first class, I know other vegetarian restaurants serve good food, but this is a cut above the rest and Luna's can boast organic food too, that's why the prices are what they are. \n\nAnyone out there who eats meat - this food can turn you around, absolutely everything on the menu tastes divine and everything they serve is top notch nutrition. \n\nAbsolutely recommend this place to everyone, even meat eaters and picky eaters, this food just bursts with flavor and goodness.\n\nNow our boys first choice to eat out is at Luna's."
1,I am in town for work and I decided to order food from here. The food was awesome! I ordered the People's Special Biryani and they brought the food right to my hotel room. I will definitely order from here again the next time I'm in town.
0,"Alright, so I've been here twice.  The atmosphere is ok, seating is a little awkward and the lighting could be better.  The service is decent, or about as decent as you can expect.  As for the food, it could be better.  While my dish (the steak quesadilla) was pretty good, some of the other dishes weren't so hot.  When I took my family, I was the only one who liked mine....everyone else ended up leaving half of theirs behind.  And considering the price of the place, it could be a whole lot better.  If I were you, I wouldn't put this place on the \""must go\"" list."
0,"I usually love places with a 50's diner atmosphere and walking into this place, it was no exception - it's cute. The jukebox, booths, decor, etc, etc make this a fun-looking place. The food (I had a burger) was okay, but nothing special. On another occasion, I went in with the sole purpose of getting a chocolate malt to go for my boyfriend and it was over $6 for just a malt. That was the point when I realized I would never be back to 5 & Diner. I think that's outrageous and hell, they're almost robbing you."
1,"Inside the Orleans Hotel & Casino, in their food court.\nOpen 24hrs.\n\nI work inside the casino, so it's always nice to get a great hamburger or pick up breakfast right after work.\n\nBreakfast is served 2am-11am.\n\nTips: Their menu has changed slightly.\nSome people have said that their special hamburgers like elk and ostrich have gone up in price.\n\nIt can also get hectic during special arena events and lines can get bad.\n\nSome days, not a lot, they close for a few hours for big cleaning times.\n\nService is always good.\n\nFree beverage refills, also coffee refills when you get the breakfast combos."
0,"This was a real disappointment.  While it is in a great location - right downtown Charlotte, the food was pretty mediocre. I ordered the grilled Ceaser salad with pulled pork. There was a good amount of meat, but it was dry and pretty bland. The salad was watery and I saw no evidence of the \""slightly charred\"" lettuce leafs. I tasted my friend's brisket , and it was even drier than my pulled pork. \n\nThe service was ok, but if you want some good BBQ, I'd steer clear of this restaurant."
0,"Let's just start off by saying that I will not return to this location.  This is a chain that has a surprisingly loyal following, but I will not be part of that multitude and here is why.\n\nThe interior has no sound abatement, so one cannot hear or understand the waitress.  This morning it was only a third full and I cannot possibly imagine what a roar it would be if it were full of patrons.\n\nI ordered eggs over medium, sausage and potato, along with \""plain\"" English muffin and juice.  My son ordered scrambled eggs, potato and corned beef hash.  \n\nUpon pretty fast service we were confronted with my fried eggs well-done hard, potato so dry that they sucked all the moisture from your mouth and were flavorless to boot.  Not a lick of salt, onion, oil, parsley or anything other than those miserable potato rectangles.  \n\nSausages were good, flavorful and not greasy.  The \""plain\"" English muffin came with the oil that they try to pretend is butter.  I handed the muffin to the waitress and reminded her that I wanted \""plain\"".  She promptly informed me that they had two types of muffin, plain and whole wheat and I ordered plain.\n\nThis is when my son and I exchanged glances and knew, really knew that this was not our day to buy lottery tickets.\n\nIt is like ordering \""regular\"" coffee in Mass and getting cream and sugar in it.  So be careful in your vocabulary or your expectations will be shattered.  Seek clarity from you waitress, if you can hear her and if she can her you.  \n\nMy son's corned beef was straight out of the can, it just had been heated and broken apart from the can shape before serving.  \n\nWe both left disappointed.  When the cashier asked \""how was everything\"" she was simply going through the formula motions because she did not miss a beat in making change along with my silence.  It seemed that Le Peep is asleep both up front and in the kitchen.\n\nI did look at the computerized bill and there was no descriptor for how eggs were to be cooked or for the muffin.  They must just trust the kitchen to cook it as they see best at any given time and if the waitress (yes, they were all females) is not on top of them the patron is at the mercy of the kitchen crew's judgement.\n\nWith so many restaurants and other forms of eating establishment in Charlotte don't waste your time at this particular Le Peep.  It appears that they are not worth a peep."
0,"This Place since taken over by MEB has turned into a shit hole, and the management here is a mess. the plumbing here is horrible, the roaches well yuck yuck yuck. the staff here has NO idea what they are doing nor do they care.. every thing is about more money.. There is No concern for the residence,, How ever the Maintnce guy's are very nice and do what they can. I will Never recommend this place again. .. The wind chiller cooler here does not keep the place cool at all especial if you choose to live on the third floor... whatever you do, keep looking... In all my years living in Apartments I have never been so disappointed in Place to live then, I cant wait till my lease is up and it will be soon.. and I am gone.. and the friend I have recommend to live here they are leaving as well.. Monarch Apartments you have so declined in staff in personality in caring... MEB I will NEVER live in one of your proprieties again .

1,"We always love this place.  Some nights it is packed and energetic and some night's not.  This past Saturday was not, likely because of the nice summer weather.  We enjoy the wine selection, appetizers, and tapas style dining.  It is very fun to order many options and share them around the table.  Be ready for lots of taste bud tantalization!  This most recent visit we took our friends from the Chicago area.  We wondered how we could impress them with all the choices they must have in a big city.  They were impressed.  Open table reservation made it very easy to book in advance on my phone.  This place is a must for your list if you have not yet visited."
0,"i decided to stop here with my bf before i left for vegas just for my coworker since he is in LOVE with the kardashians and he wanted me to buy him kims face mask. my coworkers pretty lucky that i love him that much to spend 6 bucks for him haha.\n\nthe employees there were fine but i dont get why they gave weird looks to everyone in the store. i was eyeing some sunglasses but gees i wouldn't pay $65 bucks for it,i might as well buy some coach ones at the outlet for that price! even their pencils were 4bucks bc it had a rhinestone at the top..when we know we can glue it on yourself!\n\noverpriced items,  but im not a hardcore kardashian fan so if you are..perfect place for you!\n\np.s. i noticed people on here are talking about the bag issue..i got a huge, plain black bag (no logo) for the mask (which is a small mask if you know which one im talking about.)\n\nbut i didnt know they had a \""k.k. bag\"" for certain guests...they SHOULD give every single customer those bags if \""theyre hiding or should i say only handing them to the \""SELECTED few.\"" anyone can drop $$ down even if its for a damn mask or a measly overpriced tacky pencil for $4 bucks. \n\nfor the chick that says people need to get chill pill then you might need to take one too...even if it is a bag or not..every customer should feel welcomed, catered, and customer serviced the same-fair way. im SURE you would want the same way as well. \n\nMHMMM, thought so."

0,"I never actually ate at this mobile dump, but I did make an attempt several months ago. When I rolled up, there were three people (two wearing aprons) sitting in the front patio puffing away on their Marlboro's. Is there anything more nasty than the guy about to make your overpriced taco sucking away on a cancer stick? Mmm come get the nicotine taco special folks!! I noticed a bunch of cooks and owners over the years acting similiar and I will walk away each time. I don't care if you wash your hands ten times either, first impressions count. Smoke in the back please. nasty. a waste  of a good trailer."
0,"We had lunch and drinks here when we first arrived in Vegas. The service was lack luster. The waitress obviously didn't want to be there and didn't want to serve anyone. \nThe margs were terrible, pretty much it was mix with a splash of tequilla, if you drink more than one you WILL have a stomach ache. The salsa bar was pretty good, and we enjoyed getting to have all different types. \nI would skip eating here and save your money for something more delicious, maybe go to the food court instead."
0,I have been ordering from King Wok for over a year now. The food very good however the service is TERRIBLE. I swear they NEVER get my order right (for take out or delivery). I've given them a year to fix their crappy service so I won't be ordering from them anymore.
0,"we started from no clean tables available, the only one clean had no chairs, the cashier was so distracted, we payed him $7 for the special (2 pizza slices & beer) with a $20 bill he gave me back $8, when i asked him what was this he didn't even know what was that change from, after reminding him he asked me how much is 20 minus 7, i said 13, then he grabs a pack of bills from his pocket and gives me the correct change. i was never explained that the special came with only cheese pizza, i asked to have pepperoni, he mentioned if i pay $1 he will change it for me, after getting my slices one is pepperoni the other one is cheese... after paying $1 I asked him what happened and he goes \""ill give you your $1 back and keep the slices\"" the worst place in downtown... the pizza was ok, i wouldn't come back."
0,"Avoid at all costs! \nI will recount my experience blow by blow and let you be the judge. \nI went in for a respiratory infection that was lingering for a few weeks. Office staff was professional and I did not need to wait long. MA checked blood pressure and lung capacity. Doctor Carullo enters and seemed like a nice enough guy. He checks my throat, and ears, and after a minute or two exam with little more questions, asks me my symptoms. I tell him sore throat and cough that has lingered for 5 weeks.\nThe doctor then tells me the symptoms look like HIV, no other possibilities were offered other than that. Although I tested negative 6 months ago, I was horrified (doc never asked me about that). He asked me if I wanted an HIV test explaining it costs 35.00, takes 15min and they do it for cost.  I said 100% yes. He continued for some reason why he thought I had HIV, first he said I have a geographical tongue, and canker sore. I told him that I have always had a geographical tongue and my 84 year old mother has the same, regarding the canker sores I explained I have gotten them since age 12. I said despite this, I am all for getting the test. (2nd time I agreed to the test) The doctor then continued- \""As a doctor I am basing my diagnosis on other factors as well and I am confident that these factors compel me to make this conclusion...\"" At this point he starts to go into further details to make a case for me being HIV positive until I had to literally talk over his voice and beg him to stop trying to convince me I have HIV virus. I said \""please stop you are really stressing me out\"" \n\nI happen to be on 2 mood stabilizers for severe mood swings and which was included in papers I filled out along with the medication names. \nAt this point the doctor abruptly began small talk about why I moved to Europe and if my parents lived there. I told him I did not think small talk was the best idea until the results return. After waiting 10 minutes MA brings me water And says- \""don't be stressed, life is too short to worry about these things\"" 20 minutes later MA comes in tells me I am negative and have bronchitis, he then puts me on a nebulizer machine. Did not see doctor until the end when he wrote me my prescriptions. \nMis diagnosing someone is one thing, but putting them though emotional agony for no reason is quite another. Nothing was mentioned about a possibility of bronchitis previous to the test. \nUpdate: Firstly the doctor called me to apologize in a very nice way after seeing my review. Unfortunately the story gets worse anyway. Although there was no evidence of a bacterial infection Dr Carullo prescribed an extremely potent antibiotic normally used for pneumonia called Levofloxacim. I took this medication for 10 days with zero change with my \""bronchitis\"". \nAfter leaving Vegas on business trip to europe my condition did not go away it, got worse, I began wheezing with shortness of breath, I flew back to New York to see my real doctor. Thinking I had bronchitis as Dr Carullo diagnosed, I began to panic as the only info I could find online that fitted bronchitis that serious is chronic bronchitis (an incurable fatal condition)   Finally when examined by my normal physician I was  given a chest X-Ray had my blood oxygen levels checked etc, and was diagnosed with asthma. I was given 2 inhalers one albuterol and the other a steroid inhaler.\nI am now fully recovered. I hope doctors like Carullo are exposed more often for incompetence as these mistakes are extremely damaging for the patient no matter how many times a Doctor apologizes.   \nI do not know why yelp has filtered my review. \n\nSent from my iPad"

1,"Now this little place in tucked right in the corner in between Planet Hollywood, going southbound in between \""little Hawaii\"" and/or The Harley Davidson \""Best BBQ in Las Vegas\"" sign. They have $2 tacos, or the 3 combo tacos with everything except Guacamole.   The meat was tender, flavorful, plentiful, and the salsa was fresh, both the green and red salsas were spicy as they said. I had 1 tear come out my right eye. It was a delicious meal under $10 ON THE STRIP.   Outside the restaurant, people were singing karaoke, selling t-shirts with speaker attached and colored stereo waves, and \""cheap souvenirs, and 2 for $1 waters (cold). I suppose it is a festive island, you can easily walk through, but should stop!"

1,"YUM.  \n\nSushi was sounding so good to me, I couldn't wait to get my hands on a roll or two.  After the previous night, I wasn't ready for a drink right away but they do have a really nice cocktail list.  I tasted my friend's strawberry martini and it was really smooth.  They use Japanese vodka in their drinks and you can't even taste it....now that's dangerous.  \n\nThere's a great view of the waterfall at the Wynn if you sit at the right table.  Our server was really sweet and took pretty good care of us.  I went pretty light with the field greens salad and the shrimp tempura roll.  The roll was good but the salad left a little to be desired.  I was definitely eyeing other dishes as they walked their way to other tables and everything looked delish.  \n\nThe Wynn has some great choices to dine at and Okada is really great if you're in the mood for Japanese."
1,"Really enjoyed this place ... our group of 4 were able to grab a sofa in the lounge area (towards the front of the restaurant) on a Saturday around noon to watch some college football.  The waitresses were extremely attentive (and drop-dead gorgeous).  We were the only ones near one of the larger TVs, so we requested they change the channel to a certain game.  The manager came by and confirmed with us what game we wanted and promptly put it on that game.  So far so good.  \n\nI read a few tips on Foursquare, and most beer lovers said to get a beer called \""Moose Drool Brown Ale\"", which was brewed by Big Sky Brewery out of Montana.  Boy were they right about that ... great beer.  I would highly recommend it as well.  Prices were up there (it is a spot in the Venetian after all), but not at LA or NYC levels.  I ordered the Pub Burger and it was one of the best burgers I've ever had.\n\nMy Quick and Dirty review ... \n\nAtmosphere - Great (had a cigar bar feel to it (without the smoke) ... dimly lit, leather couches, big TVs, attractive waitresses, etc.)\nFood/Drinks - Fantastic (phenomenal beer selection and one of the best burgers I've ever had)\nService - Good (very attentive and helpful in recommending beers ... did I mention attractive waitresses?)\n\nSummary - If you are a beer lover, this is a must-see in Sin City.  If you are NOT a beer lover, I would still recommend it (just get a glass of wine instead)."

0,"I ordered a medium pepperoni and mushroom pizza for carry out. It was done on time, however, they used canned mushrooms and ruined a promising pizza. The pizza also had a salty taste, was very dry and cost $14.21, which is the most I've paid for a 2-topping medium pizza in a long time. And good luck getting any menu info on the web-site. Click on appetizers and it brings up salads. No prices are listed and no pictures of the food except cover-shots on the hone page.\n\nI had a bad feeling about it when I placed my order and I couldn't understand the person on the phone. It sounded like they answered saying 'hello' and I had to confirm this was Palermo's Pizza. I told them what I wanted and they said 'ok bye' and then realized they hadn't got my phone number and asked for it. Then said 'ok bye' again without telling me how long it would take. So I asked 20-30 minutes? They said 'yes. ok bye.'\n\nI figured it must have been busy. I went in to pick up my pizza and there were only 4 customers in the place with 2 visible employees. \n\nIts ironic that I paid extra for an added topping (mushrooms) that not only cost me more, but ruined the pizza. Whatever amount of money they are saving using canned ingredients instead of fresh, they just lost 100x fold in my future business. I'll be looking elsewhere for a true New York style pizza. This isn't it."
0,"I am again, completely baffled at the discrepancy between reviews and the reality of this place.

0,"This is probably the first time I have given such a bad review to any restaurant I have eaten at. My friends and I had gone for breakfast and it could not have been worse. The bagels had no taste and nor did any of the sides we ordered. How can you make such tasteless eggs and breakfast potatoes is something I cannot understand.\nWorse there is a one cup limit on coffee. Can you believe it, for a breakfast place you get only one filling of coffee. Avoid this place like a plague if you can manage it."
0,"Our cat recently came down with some health issues that we could not afford to address. He was in pain and we decided the humane thing was to put him to sleep. We went to the ARL and asked the receptionist there if we had any other options available to us. \""Well basically the only thing you can do is sign him over for euthanasia\"" she said in the most uncaring, apathetic voice possible. We were heartbroken of course. \""Go wait by that door and someone will meet you.\"" After a few minutes another woman came out and took the carrier. \""I'll bring your carrier back out in a minute.\"" We said no, that's okay, keep the carrier. She said okay and took our cat to the back. And that was it. No kind words, no sympathetic gestures, no \""Would you like a moment before I take him?\"" No \""I'm sorry.\"" Nothing. For us this was one of the worst days of our lives but nobody at the ARL seemed to care, or at least have been trained to pretend to care, one bit. \n\nThey get a couple stars for offering a necessary service. But other than that, this place will only be associated with making a terrible day that much worse with their lack of caring or empathy."
0,"The good: lunch specials after 10pm and the food tasted ok.  Nothing that knocked my socks off, but also no major flavor problems.\n\nThe bad: for those of you who play Cards Against Humanity it's time to play the fiery poops card.  Seriously, bad stuff and I'll leave it at that.  But, if the stomach discomfort wasn't bad enough the ladies bathroom is 1) disgusting with a barely functional toilet and 2) like something out of a horror flick with burned out light bulbs and inadequate light to see without using my cell phone flash light.  \n\nSince their public customer areas are not kept in good condition, I'm certain their kitchen is probably maintained about the same.  In retrospect, it is no surprise we were treated to a double dose of germs and contaminants."
1,"I'm from NYC/NJ area, and addicted to good espresso.\nI'd found this place while I'm transferring my flight to Las Vegas.\nThe place looks hip and cool, so I had to try their espresso.\n\nTaste so GOOD, and it was so smooth with full aromatic flavor.\nThus, I had to come back on my way back.\n\nI came back for quality espresso for myself, so I highly recommend to y'all."
0,"Four queens used to be the class of downtown.  Now it has degraded to the point of A cross between a Dottys in the ghetto and an over elaborate mc mansion.  The slots are locked down at 89 percent, and despite having a few dealers that are 100 percent on point, fun, chatty, and extremely entreating, the majority of dealers are so cold, and deprived of life that they would fit in like a champ in a Adams Family movie, or even a Godzilla flick.  The mid shift casino manager is a grade A Dick, with a capital D, it's like someone got a soar dick and named it after him.   Carlos, yeah talking to you baby, take a few black chips off his craps table 3 or 4 nights in a row, and he'll kick you off \""his\"" table games.  Apparently winners are not allowed here.  The main bonus, and definitely a reason to frequent this place is there are lots of very attentive, cute, and quick cocktail girls.  I would rank them towards the top of the line on Fremont street were the average age of a cocktail girl is pushing 60, the queens has broken through and done something very right with younger, attractive, and pleasant gals.  Very cute outfits, and always smiling, what more could a man ask for, it reason to play in the casino if you can skirt the mean mugging dealers.  Ditch the crappy pit bosses whom have been promoted to the upper limits of there irresponsibility, get some dealers that smile every now and than, kick out the bums that get to ya before security does (need more proactive based security, kick out the bums as soon as they walk in\n... Looks like a bum, smells like a bum, GTFO!), and the queens could return to the class of downtown that it once was."
1,"absolutely amazing food. I hated Thai completely until I had this place. there seafood anything is awesome.

Really?  AOL?  you have got to be kidding, right?\n\nOne very odd thing...they have bathroom attendants.  Yes.  Really.  In every restroom there is an attendant who hands you paper towels to dry your hands and goes around keeping the bathrooms clean.  They are VERY clean, some of the cleanest I have ever been in for an airport.  But, then you feel guilty because you should really tip these guys.  But, I usually don't travel with much cash, so, I didn't have any money for a tip....sad"
0,They are not nice. I asked that half of my sub be wrapped to take home.  The server then informed me that they threw it in the garbage by mistake.  Did they try to compensate us in any way by maybe not charging us for the pie dessert? No.  Not even an apology.

0,"If you're the kind of person who likes overpaying to get food poisoned, you should book it to this place FAST.  \n\nI tried to order the crunchy rice with tuna- which is simply a bowl of deep-fried rice with tuna sashimi over it.  I asked if I could substitute the deep fried 'crunchy rice' with plain white rice.  The waiter had to consult with the owner about this and eventually returned to tell me that ALL of their plain white rice came 'pre-shaped' into little squares, so I would have to have that instead of a regular bowl of rice.  I said that was fine.  \n\nAfter about 45 minutes, he returned with a plate of 4 rice squares topped with small pieces of tuna.  I was skeptical about whether that was a portion equivalent to what I would get had I ordered the regular bowl, but whatever.  By the way, I noticed that the full sushi bar was not being used at all by the sushi chef, he was prepping and bringing out all of the sushi from the back, which was a little suspect.\n  \nAfter paying 18 dollars for the above and a small Kirin, I headed home to a full blown stomach flu within 12 hours.  I came here with a friend and she actually ordered the SAME exact thing I did, presented in the SAME way and she got sick as well...it was the only thing we had eaten in common that day.  \n\nAs a sidenote, the waiter was totally rude and continually gave me looks like I was on an episode of Portlandia playing the 'overly-concerned-about-food-preparations' health hipster, when ALL I wanted was plain white rice.  \n\nUgh."
1,"I am a huge steak person. I live in LA and I've been to every fancy steakhouse in LA, most of the well known steakhouses in NY and Vegas. \n\nEcho and Rig may not be the best steakhouse I've ever been to, but it's up there. What truly impressed me was the value. The steaks and appetizers were as good as Mastro's (both Vegas and LA) yet it cost almost half as much. The service was as good. \n\nI've told my wife that we'll be going there every time we go to Vegas."

I followed up with him on 11/19 and he said he will work it up and have it to me by Friday 11/22. He immediately charged by credit card. Still no call or completion. I called up once again on Wedneday 11/27 and asked about the status. James was not in the office and called back on Monday 12/2 to find out nothing was done, no production at all. James apologized and said he would have it by the end of the day. I asked to speak to Dominic the manager who seemed like it was not a big issue at all, so then I spoke to Ernie the owner. I told him I was trying to get signs done since 4 weeks ago and James consistenty dropped the ball. I asked for a full refund and will take my business elsewhere. I was referred to a Realtor that does quite a big business with them and really disappointed. Highly recommend to go somewhere else. You get what you pay for and this place has zero customer service."
1,Coworkers and I go here for lunch and all I can say is amazing!  The owners are so proud of the food that they serve and are always willing to make recommendations.  As the other review said don't be fooled for the look of the place you will not be disappointed.  The last time I had this beef cooked in it's own juices and want to just keep going back for more.  We tried the churros OMG delicious!  Definitely do not just drive by this place!

0,Waited in line to see how long a wait would be for three people. A gentlemen waiting in the opposite line psychically grabbed me and pulled me back and said that he was in front of me. I told him that there was clearly two lines and that my party was larger than his party of two so either way I'd still be waiting much much longer than him. The hostess told me to head to the end of the line and wait once again even though I had all ready waited in the double line for 10-15 minutes.\n\nAbsolutely terrible customer services and something I wouldn't expect from PF Changs...a place I often visit at my home town which I won't visit anymore.\n\nI'll never be back!
0,"This is an update to the review I posted over a year ago, and I'm sorry to say that this has to be - by far - the worst meal we've had in the 10 years we've been in Vegas.\n\nLast time we ordered combos, and that seems to have made the difference.  This time, not so hungry after snacking at an earlier function, we decided to go the individual dish route.\n\nThe same 13 choices are on the menu.  Except for one lamb, one fish (which I'd be afraid to try here) and a vegetable combo, the rest are beef, beef, and more beef.  The veggie might have been an option, but not after two of them were listed as collard greens and cabbage.  Not exciting at all.  \n\nI wanted a glass of honey wine, which I had tasted a few years earlier at a different Ethiopian restaurant.  It's a strange wine, but I've got strange tastes.  Almost verbatim, the owner repeated the same line as last time, about the wine coming from L.A. and they didn't get the shipment.  Coincidence?  Maybe.  But I don't think so.  He didn't suggest anything else, and I didn't ask.  I was already feeling the downer vibe, and stuck with water.\n\nI started to order the dry-sauteed beef, but he said it might be a little dry and chewy, so we switched to two others.  They seemed to be variations of the same dish.  One had some tomatoes added to the jalape\u00f1os and onions,  and was in tiny pieces.  The other had longer strips that were way too long to eat comfortably, and also had the jalape\u00f1os and onion, but no tomatoes.  Both dishes were poured into a large tray lined with the injera bread, and the tray had a tiny serving of salad - two tablespoons if I'm being generous - for each of us.\n\nThe small beef dice had no flavor whatsoever.  The long strips had a little more flavor, though not much.  Both were improved by the vinegar in the injera. But they were both tough as nails.  When the owner came over to ask how things were going, I told him that the beef was tough.  He paused a couple of seconds, said \""Okay,\"" and walked away.  The salad didn't taste fresh and had some brown pieces.\n\nThe only other customers were a table of four with a baby who didn't stop shrieking the whole time.  But they provided some much-needed entertainment:  the kid sat on the mother's lap and kept yanking at the strings of beads that were the front window curtain.  Each time she pulled, the rod arced downward, and the mom never attempted to stop her.  This being Vegas, I made book with Herb about how long it would take before the whole curtain came crashing down.  Neither of us won, because thankfully they left halfway through our meal.  Then the music was cranked up a little.  I love Arabic music with a beat, 'cause I can belly dance in my seat.  But this stuff was some awful male singer wailing, and it was unbearable.\n\nThe only thing good that I can say is that at least it's cheap.  Each of our beef dishes was 9.99.  But since it comes only with the anemic little bit of salad, and the beef obviously wasn't filet mignon, it wasn't worth even that much.  I can't even say \""stick with the chicken,\"" because there was none."
0,"Are there hotels that don't allow kids? If so can someone let me know where they are? \n\nWe switched hotels halfway through our trip to be closer to the field where my brother is practicing. Having said that I am directly comparing my pleasant experience at the Hilton Garden Inn to my short stay at the Grace Inn of AhwHADDACALLIT. From the website and even the front of the building it looks like a decent hotel. It has a pool, a 3-star rating on Hotels.com (show's ya what they know. I'm stickin' with Yelp) and it SAYS they have wireless. What they fail to mention is that they only have wireless in the first and second floor lobbies. You need a high speed cable to connect in your room and the cable is short so you are chained to the desk area. My gawd! How spoiled do I sound right now?!! Anyhow, the beds are extremely uncomfortable, the full breakfast was somewhat laughable and the noisy, and very misbehaved I might add, kids at the pool was enough to make me lose my mind, up in there, up in there. \n\nDidn't have a chance to check out their BG's Lounge for a cocktail, Lord knows I could have used one. But don't think I'm going to be back anytime soon. Thanks but no thanks."
1,Surprisingly good food.
1,"The orders don't really allow for a a lot of variety. Its pretty much a meat, cheese, potatoes, tomatoes and slaw. The guys are nice but tell em EXACTLY what you want."
1,"A series of controversial reviews made me hesitate about this place in the beginning but I'm happy that I decided to check it for myself. The food was excellent, the price was reasonable and the restaurant was clean and elegant. I loved the Koobideh which is by far the best I've had in the Persian restaurants in the States.  Definitely will go again at my next trip to Vegas."
1,"This is my favorite spot in Vegas to stop for breakfast.  I'm the kind of guy who likes breakfast food at all times of the day.  Their skillets here are amazing, and so are their pancakes!  Highly recommend!"
0,"I must preface this review by saying that I did not actually eat here. They would not let me. \n\nI had reservations for two at 6 pm. Our flight arrived in Vegas at 3:30. My friend, who was traveling with me, arrived without his bag. They said it would be around 10 that night before he got it. The big problem - my friend only had shorts. The restaurant had a \""no shorts\"" policy. I called the reservation line and asked if they would make an exception - NO. I went directly to the restaurant and asked if they would make an exception - NO. I understand policies. I have them in my business. My deal on policies is that, if circumstances dictate, I make exceptions. This is not the theory for Prime Steakhouse. At least for us, it wasn't. \n\nI saw many of the patrons of Prime later that night. I have to say I couldn't effectively gauge the dress code. There were hookers with body parts spilling out of all parts of their dresses (that's using the term \""dress\"" liberally). There were men in ripped jeans (which they said they had a policy against) but I guess when you pay $400 for ripped jeans, it doesn't count. Shorts are not okay but T-shirts are??? \n\nI wish I could tell you about Prime, but their inane adherence to selective policies prevents me."
1,"Oh, yum. YUM YUM YUM YUM. I am so happy to have found another great restaurant in Charlotte - we had relatives staying with us last week and didn't want to take them anywhere we hadn't been yet, in case it wasn't good, and we went to Mimosa after they left - were were so upset we didn't take them here! \n\nThe service was excellent - our waiter was totally on point and had a great personality, and we made excellent recommendations - I'll get to that in a minute. The atmosphere is beautiful - we ate outside, it was a gorgeous night. They have fountains right out front and large plants out on the terrace to create a nice relaxing feel. The restaurant has soft lighting and stone walls, and you could eat inside or out and it will be just as beautiful. \n\nFor an appetizer we got the mussels, which were in a garlic butter white wine broth - we were scouring the broth for escaped mussels by the end of it because it was so good we devoured it. Of course, even though I say I won't, I dunked the bread in the broth - delish. For the main course I had the horseradish-crusted salmon, which was very good. If you order this be aware that while the salmon is hot, it is served over cold vegetables - cucumbers and green beans. The dish wasn't as great as I thought it would be and I had immediate food-envy when my finacee's dish was placed in front of him - piping hot scallops, shrimp and lobster over grits and brown gravy - WOW! This was so yummy that I totally dipped into his dish after I finished mine. The manager even came over to see how we were because he noticed the switch - he was so nice, and stopped over a second time just to talk once our meal was finished. I can't wait to go back here!"
1,"I recently went to get highlights and a cut and and am very happy I chose this place. Brandi was awesome and it's true, she gives the best scalp massage!"
0,"My bf picked up Chinese since I mentioned that I was craving some. We just moved to this area from out of state. Chinese food is scarce around here ! He bought shrimp lo mein which came with a fried rice, a cream cheese wonton and a veggie eggroll. Ehh.. The wonton was seriously lacking filling.  The eggroll was pretty mushy inside,  maybe sat around too much.  The shrimp lo mein had good flavor and shrimp was plump and not overcooked.  But it was overall pretty over seasoned or salty. I couldnt keep eating.  \n\nThe only pro would be that they deliver.  Otherwise I'll keep searching for a good Chinese joint to satisfy the need next time."
0,"Mimi's is one of those restaurants that you want to like more.\n\nI say that because the execution is somewhat lacking.  We have been coming here, on and off, for five years now.  It's the coupons in the Sunday paper, or the email club that draw us in.  The pictures of the food look really good. But it's just, okay.  \n\nOne piece of advice for management would be to ease up on the salt.  Neither of us have sodium issues, but we would suspect that after coming here enough we would.  The gravy or sauce on our last visit was so bad, we were scrapping it off the food.\n\nAlso, time moves more slowing at Mimi's.  Maybe it's the lack of exterior windows, but it feels like I'm in a casino buffet room.  It's could also be the somewhat older crowd, who just sits, chats and just drinks coffee.   I do not believe it's the staff's fault, they seem to hustle around the place refilling drinks, etc. But, it would be hard to tell what time of day it is here.\n\nSorry!"
1,"I encourage everyone in the market for a tattoo to stop by and check out Classic Tattoo. Steve, Jacob, Eric, and Holly are the best in town! Bold lines that hold the test of time are one of the many reasons I have chosen this shop to complete multiple pieces including my back. This shop is extremely clean and the crew is always friendly and welcoming, making this a comfortable shop for any first timers too. \n\nCheap Tattoos ain't Good\nGood Tattoos ain't Cheap\n\nThese guys are a bargain when compared to the quality of work they're putting out!"
0,"Why does this place get 4 stars?? The food, even for diner food, was totally forgettable. My bf's breakfast burrito was nothing special and my gyros sandwich was ok but the pita was buttered. Not everything is better with butter! The place looked like the dining room at a retirement  home. There were a few regulars but I would assume they go there because it is close to home not because the food is good. The one positive was our waitress. She was really helpful and funny with her regulars. However, she kept telling us 'I hope you're hungry ordering all that food'. We were expecting Saddle Ranch size plates the way she kept going on about the portion size! Totally not the case. His meal was actually on the small side. Very strange. This place is for AARP crowd."
0,"RED LOBSTERS NEW CLAIM TO FAME IS THEY HAVE FISH EXPERTS ON HAND TO FIX YOUR FOOD. LMAO REALLY BECAUSE THEY SO CALLED EXPERT CANT FRY FISH AS COMMON AS CAT....THAT'S CATFISH \nThe staff are nice and they are updating their look. But they need to hire better cooks. I think they may have a pastry chef cooking fish. Because that's just what I ordered. Lord why me? That's all I was busy thinking all that night. The fish was taken back 4 times. Couples ate and left and they still brung me half done catfish. So, they cooked it 4 times and its still not done. It's catfish my god daughter who is 8 can fry catfish.\nEverything was perfect but the catfish. It makes me ponder how many chefs does it take to cook catfish at Red Lobster? It's fried catfish people. UGH! Anyway I will return and give them another chance to please me. However I will order chicken or some other dish. Red Lobster has made me a little angry because I cut the fish into 3 and they just kept re-frying the same 3 fish its like hello can someone get a clue and send new catfish to the table. So the manager took it off my ticket. On the way out I took a picture of the Lobsters inside the tank and went home. Yes they told me they was sorry a million times. I am to I'm sorry I had to look at uneatable fish and could not have a nice dinner with my husband."
0,Lunch specials looked good but orange chicken was 75% batter. Maybe 2 ounces of meat. Egg drop soup tasteless. The staff was very cold and not friendly. Food was just okay.
1,"Great sushi, big portions. Friendly staff."
1,Restaurant review only. \n\nExcellent 5 star restaurant!\n\nFirst class all the way!\n\nTip - Try the fried oreo's! YUM!!!!
1,So great! The ramen is great and everybody should get the fried rice! So great!
1,"My wife and I have this running debate about what \""five stars\"" means. \n\n I have given places five stars in the CONTEXT on the class of restaurant (like cheap burger joint). And other times I have been too free (I am a bit of a five star slut) with my high ratings.\n\nBut folks, from the bottom of my heart, NOCA is a solid 5 star, in any class.  Best restaurant in PHX, period. Six star if I could do it.\n\nI almost dinged them a bit for the hostess taking a while to come to the front of the restaurant to great us and for the slightly slow waitress.  But the food is ridiculously good.   I could have sat and served myself.\n\nTo be clear, I don't mean - \""Large quantities\"" or \""Cheap\"" when I say good.  I mean fine crafted food. Layered flavors. Things your tongue didn't knew existed. Balance. Food nirvana... \n\nWorth every penny. I can't wait to go back.  Thank God for NOCA!"
1,Been here several times. The staff are very friendly and helpful. Try the ham and brie baguette. I also really enjoyed the Nutella latte.
0,"I strongly dislike this airport. I had to catch a connecting flight from Phoenix to Maui in another terminal. I had no idea I had to leave security, catch a bus, and then go through the TSA line again to get to the other terminal. I have an especially bitter taste in my mouth for Sky Harbor because this is where I lost my college class ring! In my mind the only redeeming part of Sky Harbor is Bar Fly, the coolest airport bar ever."
0,"LivingSocial/ Groupon buyers? BEWARE! \n\nThis has got to be the worst service I think I've ever received from Vegas, ever! And I have not even gone on my trip yet!\n\nI was about to book through another company (should've just gone through them) but after seeing the awesome reviews on Yelp! and Tripadvisor AND realizing this deal would save me the most money, I thought why the heck not.\n\nTo be sure this \""business\"" could accommodate my party of 8 [for next week on 11/09] before going through the headaches of coordinating everyone to buy via LivingSocial, I gave them a call. \n\nI spoke to a very friendly and nice girl by the name of Sarah on Oct 29th. I asked if she had enough slots available and if I should just go ahead and buy my voucher and hold the spot. She advised me to do so and that space was available at the time. I bought my ticket, she used my voucher code to hold my spot (MORE ON THAT IN ONE SECOND, KEEP READING!) and said to call back. I should've been worried the moment I got a confirmation of another person's party instead (PRIVACY LAW ANYONE?)  I tried to be understanding. \n\nFast forward 3 days to today, after getting everyone to finally buy all their tickets (again its a pain in the arse to do so) I called back and after three times of being sent to voicemail during what should be operating hours, I left a message. Thank jebus I called back because what a guy by the name of James told me next, pretty much ruined our vegas plans and my friends 21st bdays.\n\nJame's advised me because I was booking through Livingsocial, there was no more space available for our party. Only \""people who paid full price online have slots available.\"" I was shocked. A little understanding still considering it wasn't their faults completely my friends took forever to buy their vouchers, but still shocked. \n\nI knew from here it was going to hell knowing how livingsocial works. Since Sarah redeemed my voucher to \""hold my spot\"" I was SOL. After going back and forth with L.S. on the line and james, L.S. advised me I was no longer able to get a refund through them due to this THIEVING of a companies hold policies; told me to ask the company for a refund.\n\nI tried and what happened next is what really irked me off so much, I'm writing this review because of it. I WOULD GIVE 0 STARS IF I COULD! James basically told me that I was not getting a refund (even though their refund policy is 72 hours in advance) and that basically my money was worthless to them. Said that \""you got it at a heavily discounted rate, its like $18 a person, were not really making any money\"" and \""i dont see what the problem is when you already have a reservation\"" I'm so sorry my $75 for two people is too pathetic for you. \n\nI'm sorry I bought through a third party you guys obviously need because clearly you dont have enough hotshots willing to spend the full price, and im so sorry you guys have no clue how to save future business when you can make exceptions (you have enough space for rich people, but not us poor (or smart) folk trying to save a buck) but choose to have this \""not my problem\"" attitude. Was even going to consider your full price but James sealed the nail on the coffin after being such a difficult person to work with. \n\nYou're so lucky that I did buy through LS as I got my deal free therefore did get a refund already (ha!) or else I'd be raising much more hell than I am.\n\nAgain, ESPECIALLY YOU GROUPON folks, beware and dont let them redeem your codes for ish until you're ready!"
1,Good food at a reasonable price. I didn't try the lunch buffet upstairs but ordered a meal downstairs. Service great and very quick.
1,amazing paninis.\namazing homemade lemonade.\namazing atmosphere.\nreally good place for brunch.\n\nand who can beat the lovely euro feel of old montreal?
1,"Good burger, Good Atmosphere.\n\nI had the Western burger, which was pretty good. It was made with buffalo meat. Yum. So it was pretty juicy. It was lacking the BBQ sauce it hoped to promise though. Overall I'd order it again, just ask for more sauce.\n\nMy BF got the Sam I am, which has a fried egg on it, and normally comes with ham on top, out server suggested replacing it with bacon, and so that's what he did. The egg explodes in your mouth when you bite into this burger. It's gooood. And the pesto on it is simply delicious.\n\n\nThe part that disappointed me thought, was that our sides...sweet potatoes fries, and tater tots were overwhelmingly salty. It may have been an accident, but I couldn't eat more than five, and I was done with them.\n\nOverall, I'd go back."
1,"This is one of my favorite places to eat Lunch. Attentive staff, Great Salads and also a individual sized Pizza with salad and drink....great food at a really good price."
0,"It's cold here, like anywhere indoors in Vegas.  We came for a late lunch on Labor Day weekend, so it was still a little crowded even around 1pm, a 10-minute wait.  But we got a nice table by the fountains and strip club, so it was pleasing for both parties. :)\n\nThe food seemed a little 'meh', to put it best.  It was very run-of-the-mill island bar fare.  Basically their take on \""Hawaiian\"" burgers is to put bacon or avocados on everything, with a slice of pineapple on the side.  Last time I checked, that really doesn't have very much to do with the beautiful islands of Hawai'i at all.  Neither does the Buffalo Burger, which we ordered.\n\nThe burger came out medium rare, which was nice.  Although, my girlfriend did later complain about some stomach pains, which made it a tough day.\n\nThe prices here are going to be resort prices - you can get better just by walking around in Vegas, and I suggest you do, unless you're absolutely set on eating at the Miracle Mile Shops."
0,It was good but parking sucks and the chicken looked pink and I asked if it was ok to eat and they said that's just the way the chicken looks. So we will see if I get sick. Also they had problems with their soda machine.
1,one of my favorite theaters in the valley. great food options outside the theater!

0,"I work in healthcare and it takes ALOT for me to feel let down by medical personnel. I don't know whether to blame the Dr or her staff. During my first visit, Dr Aragon was nice and thorough but it was obvious she was preoccupied. She ordered a lan and directed me to make appt to discuss it after it comes back. I got my labs drawn 7/31. Waited 1 week, no response. Called on 8/7 and was told I had to leave a message, left message, waited 1 week with no response.  Called back on 8/15 and was told someone would call back after Dr was done \""reviewing\"" my labs. Come 9/9 still nothing! I call and told them I wanted to pick up my labs to take to another Dr and was told \""well, we usually don't call if the labs are normal\"" which contradicts what Dr Aragon said. Then I said well I am picking it up (to take somewhere else) but can you tell me if you even have it and are you authorized to tell me if I am at least OK? A moment of silence while she reviews it, \""Oh! Well...I'm looking at it and you should definitely come in and talk to the Dr about it!\"" REALLY? Now I've wasted time and money that I don't have and here I am left untreated (if theres even anything wrong). Don't waste your time and money here."
0,"Okay, definitely one of the greatest food disappointments I've experienced ever. For years I have heard of this infamous Frozen Hot Chocolate that I so deeply regretted opting out of during my visit to NY a few months back. So even after an enormous buffet lunch and an almost as equally large Thai dinner, I made sure that I could squeeze some of this drink in me. I am so sad to have wasted my stomach space.\n\nThe Frozen Hot Chocolate is nothing but a glorified Starbucks Frappuccino for triple the price. The cup size is way smaller than I had expected for an $11 drink. Perhaps you pay for the ambience and experience when you sit in the restaurant, but the to-go line is a definite no-go. The whipped cream is also coming out of a generic brand can, so it's also great knowing that you're paying for such fine quality. And the worst part of the night was the unfriendly worker who wouldn't give me a cup of tap water so that I could somehow manage to finish the overly sweetened, overly expensive, overrated cup of chocolate in my hand!"
1,This food is amazing will definitely be back for some more. I had the chile Colorado burrito looked so good got right to it and forgot to take a picture.
1,"Fabulous place to stop for kitchen gadgets that are both functional and visually appealing- most products are cute and serve an important kitchen role, though arguably the majority of goods here aren't \""needed\"" in your kitchen. They're fun though, and who doesn't like making cooking fun?!\n\nKitchenova is a great place for gifts, whether you need to attend a housewarming or just want to buy yourself something that will be fun to use in your culinary adventures. You'll find several options for popsicle makers, tons of wine accessories, and a lot of entertainment pieces. \n\nFavorite items here include the various novelty ice cube molds, gourmet tea selection and loose-leaf holders, and of course the BlendTec blenders- anyone got a spare iPone handy?!\n\nBonus points for being able to order in items from various companies. Kitchenova staff are friendly, helpful, and passionate about kitchenware. Grand Opening had several product demos, and space is clean, modern, and welcoming. I only wish I had more kitchen cabinets for all of the non-essential but awesome tools and toys that caught my eye here."
1,"Dave and I were exploring to new places around our new home and came across this lovely cafe in the middle of the Arizona Center. We were greeted and seated right away, we chose the patio to enjoy then spring weather. The ambiance was casual and made you feel like you were eating at home.  The service was quick and the staff very knowledgeable.  We even got a personal visit from the manager to ensure we were enjoying our dining.  \n\nWe started the dinner off with the best chips and salsa I have ever tasted. The salsa tasted like heaven and I am very picky about my salsa. I believe it was made with some adobo sauce. To wash it down we tried the pitcher of canyon margaritas.   The prickly pear and cranberry provided a nice flavor twist although it was a bit too sweet for Dave's liking. \nFor dinner, Dave tried the Southwestern tortellini  and I had the mini chimichangas.  The tortellini were covered in a chorizo cream sauce and was delicious.  The mini chimichangas did not disappoint mouth watering flavor in every bite.  Both meals were superb.  We decided to splurge for dessert and tried the tres leches cake with a strawberry sauce.  It was the most moist tres leches I have ever tried (even ones I have tried to make).  It was the perfect ending to a great meal.  If that wasn't enough they provided a commentary dessert, a divine white chocolate almond tamale.  A fun twist on the traditional tamale.  Even the left overs the next day were amazing. \n\nOver all this was a fabulous place to visit.  The only downside is that our meal was a bit pricy but I am sure that the $25 margarita pitcher didn't help. I would and will definite visit this place again, especially since it is only 0.2 miles away."
0,"Service was for the most part prompt but I think that's about all the positive I can say. Actually the coffee was good too. We went here for breakfast the other day as I saw the 4 star review. My wife had chicken fried steak and was rather bland and had too much gravy on it. Home fires were pretty good though. I had corned beef hash and eggs - not nearly enough corned beef served. The kicker was within an hour of leaving, we both became sick. Not crazy vomiting sick, but nauseous like you feel like your going to vomit sick - gurgling belly with heart burn.  My best guess as we ordered different items was a dirty kitchen grill."
0,We all felt sick all night ...wasn't impressed especially for the price. Don't order the cosmo fizz it's super tart and not enjoyable. I didn't eat very much because I don't eat a lot of pasta and still felt sick all night ....can't see ever going back.
1,"Best Ceviche & chicha Morada outside of Peru.  Ceviche is very fresh just like the costal towns in Peru. I travel a lot and I can say we are very lucky to have a restaurant of this Caliber in Las Vegas. None of the top notch restaurants in the strip that serve ceviche come close to freshness, taste and authenticity of this establishment. Their chicha Morada is homemade and it blows other similar drinks to pieces.  I always passed by this restaurant and was reluctant to try it at first since the shopping center it is located is large and secluded.  I now regret why I did not try this restaurant earlier. Don't make the mistake I made....you may regret it!"
1,"Swung in here on a recent early-summer weeknight and only later realized they'd just opened the place.  It had been packed the previous weekend, with a front window that opens up onto the great terrasse on Avenue Mont-Royal.  Terrasse was unfortunately closed on this particular night as the permit was in transition, so we sat inside.\n\nOur fab serveuse, Emilie, was very quick to serve us and knowledgeable on the beers on tap.  Saint-Sacrament has house blonde and rousse brews, the former of which isn't stupendous in terms of taste but is rather good, and one could imagine sinking quite a few over the course of a Saturday night.  Other beers on tap include Stella Artois, Hoegaarden, Alexander Keith's, and a couple others -- nothing out-of-the-ordinary.\n\nThe bar seemed not quite as well-stocked as it could be, but the place does not profess to be a nightclub or cocktail bar, and Emilie was able to improvise where necessary.  It is, quite directly, a tavern.\n\nAmbiance was really where Saint-Sacrament has things kicking on all cylinders.  Amazing long wooden tables made from reclaimed wood are at bar-stool height, and are great for larger groups.  (I anticipate if you show up at a decent hour on a weekend, you won't have to contort to ask for chairs from other tables.)  Fantastic tin ceiling.  There are about four or five individual and properly-interior-designed washrooms in the back.  Place is spotless, and the music is fantastic: good mix of Rolling Stones (\""Bitch\""!  Hadn't heard that in years), Johnny Cash, and other proper pub music blasting over a great sound system.  After cranking the music up louder at one point, one of the proprietors actually came over to make sure our table wasn't disturbed by the volume, since we were right under the speaker.  Nice touch there, too.  (Considering the quality of the music we weren't disturbed at all.)  There's at least one TV in there; it was being used for a Euro repeat when we arrived, but as the night wore on it was shut off in favour of the music, which is entirely proper for any reputable establishment.\n\nDidn't try any of the food, but everything coming out of the kitchen looked nice.  Prices for the beer and liquor are very modest for a watering hole that has a proper sense of design and great service about it.  Bottom line: certainly worth spending a few hours in here if you're in the Plateau on a weekend night (or even a weeknight).  They're opened until 3am each and every night, too -- c'est g\u00e9nial!"
0,Totally overcharged and the owner is a perve. Next year it's Turbo Tax for me baby!
0,you wait 1/2 hour for no service. this is not the place to go on sundays! And the moronager is no better! Hey fatboy! People are waiting! Make yourself usefull. Do your job and service the customers or I go to triple B! Better Business Bureau! And CEO!
1,"Luck be a lady tonight...luck be a lady tonight...luck if you've ever been a lady to begin with...luck be a lady tonight!\n\nNow you would think a city like Vegas would have a massive building with all their historic neon signs all lit up as a blinding tribute to Sinatra-era glitz. Leggy showgirls would act as docents and hand out free sunglasses to prevent retina damage among the patrons. But no, not even close. It's not a museum in the traditional sense...it's more the open-air variety you would find in a third-world country where you would pay to see local peasants making flour with a rock.\n\nThe Neon Museum actually consists of two locations - one is the Fremont East area where refurbished neon signs are on display in the street median, the other is a bit north of downtown where there is a \""boneyard\"" of aged neon signs leaning against each other in a couple of lots surrounded by a canvas-covered chain-link fence. Fremont East is intriguing at night as the neon signs form a parade of sorts highlighted by the Hacienda Cowboy hovering over a stoplight (see the gallery). Make sure to watch out for the drunken revelers who frequent the clubs lining the street. They're a mean bunch.\n\nI only became aware of the boneyard through Anthony Bourdain's show where he was given a retro-swing tour by a Sammy Davis Jr. impersonator. So after an afternoon in Red Rock Canyon, Jamie W. and I made a beeline to the boneyard only to realize that you have to make an advance reservation to gain entry. Damn. We did take a peek though the fence to see what we were missing - a hodgepodge of gigantic, rusting signs that look almost like a surreal montage of one big hangover. \n\nI donated $15 online to the museum, the admission they charge for a private tour, since I did take a few snaps from the outside (see the gallery). I hope they get enough funding to realize their goal of converting the retro-cool La Concha Motel lobby into the museum visitor center. These signs deserve a lot more care than can be afforded in a junkyard. Where's Fred and Lamont? You hear that, Elizabeth? I'm coming to join ya, honey!"
1,The Diavolo pizza is the best pizza I've ever had! Way better than Bicanco! It's a must have is you like a little kick with your pizza.
1,"I met my husband and some friends for dinner here & we had a good experience. The food came out quickly, & while I always order the same thing at sushi places, I was very pleased with my meal. We were the only ones in there on a Tuesday night, but we weren't complaining! I'd go there again."
0,"Great service, but this is honestly the worst food I have ever eaten out at a restaurant in my life. I dont suggest going here for food EVER (maybe for the drink specials and hookah but nothing else)."
1,tried this place last night. great food. not much atmosphere but nice people. Nice to have some ethnic choices that are true to their roots. My wife's family is polish and slovak. We will go back.
0,"I am writing this review from the front bench of this restaurant. This experience was horrible which is sad from an establishment like Hash House. We got to the restaurant at 3:30, in between lunch and dinner and we were forced to order from the brunch menu. My sister does not eat eggs and asked if she could have the dinner chicken and biscuits. She was told no and that the closest thing was a Benedict dish. She said can I get it without the eggs. The waitress said that their dishes were works of art and nothing could be removed or substituted. My brother in law wanted a biscuit, since we were outside of dinner, he was denied an order of biscuits, even after we offered to pay for them since it was his birthday. Overall, this experience made his birthday one we will always remember due to the unprofessional behavior of its servers, its inflexibility of its chef and the poor times of its menu window. It's such a shame that Hash House has been brought to this level since by the pictures in the lobby, they were amazing!"
1,"Great morning shift staff, there is one lady here who actually memorized my name after a couple visits. And after not going for a while I showed back up and she still remembered me. Great people to talk to and easy service. Juice is a tad watery"

1,"This is a little gem on east Madison. Thanks to Yelp's Boozing and Schmoozing event, I got to learn about Old Sugar Distillery on my first trip here. It's awesome to know that they source locally as much as possible and do the brewing and distillation themselves. \n\nTheir drinks are awesome! I had the honey cap -- made with their very own honey liquer. As mentioned on their menu, this drink is so delicious, it goes down very easily and you won't feel that you are having an alcoholic drink until moments later, which is not a bad thing =) \n\nSnacks wise, they serve Banzo pita and hummus, which complement your drinks nicely. \n\nEven though I came as a group in an organized event, you don't have to do that in order to get a 'tour' of the place. The people there are very nice and friendly and more than happy to explain you how things work and show you around. \n\nThe outdoor patio is a plus. Sipping drinks out in the sun and enjoying the weather outside. Love my first experience and I will be back when I am in the Eastside again."
1,Great food and great service. I really like the nice calm atmosphere they have at breakfast. You can also do take out for breakfast.
1,"Man I looooove me some JAMBA JUICE!!!! I've been waiting for them to open one in the southwest.... The rest of them are so spread out across the valley in malls and the university PLUS the cluster of them on the east side and in Henderson, about time the southwest got some love!!! This one is RIGHT by my house too.... So convenient =]\n\n\nI finished a fast right on time for their grand opening and the season debut of the PUMPKIN SMASH!!!!! What I wait patiently for each year! I get the small and make it light, only 260 calories. And very much worth it! Haha best dessert ever! I've already visited the new location 3 times in the past week. This is going to be bad! Wish they did punch cards haha. I did get a receipt to do a survey and get buy one, get one next time! And I'm on it!!!!\n\n\nPS I need your # Jamba!! Gotta call in orders when I'm on the fly! Oh yeah, first Jamba with a drive thru-- BONUS!!!!!"
1,"I had a BBQ Beef Sandwich at Chase's Diner today. Good food as well as good fries. This is one of those 50's style diners that's fun to eat at. I also like the sign I read when eating there that stated,\nAll Unattended Children Will Be Given an Espresso and a New Puppy. \nHilarious."
1,"I've had my eye on this place before it even opened and finally got the chance to check it out! \n\nInside is just BEAUTIFUL (see pics) An upscale but casual feel.\nThey also have a spacious patio area.\n\nAll the staff that I came in contact with were very friendly and informative. \n\nI ordered an Ice Tea........it was good. \nThey served me hot crusty bread with these Fabulous Rosemary Cheese Crisps.......I asked for more they were so good!! ;-) (see pics) \n\nThe waitress told me I could modify any item on the menu if I needed to or special order anything I didn't see.... \n\n..that is a HUGE plus when a place is willing to go above and beyond to accommodate you and also means they obviously are preparing these items fresh if they can change any item. I definitely appreciate that. \n\nI decided on ordering the Roasted Chicken and Butternut squash risotto, Lunch portion comes with salad. (see pics) \n\nOMG.....SO Delicious and piping HOT, it had such amazing flavor depth, topped with crisp prosciutto and fresh basil chiffonade. \n\nI was in heaven, I'm gonna dream about that dish for sure! \n\nNow for dessert, they offer about ten different things in a mini teacup size...........WOW! That is so cool, you can try more than one thing without being a total pig or spending a fortune! LOVE IT!! \n\nI decided on one of the many creme brulee' flavors, I got the brown sugar (see pics) Perfect size Perfect Flavor, truly!\n\nI noticed on their website that they serve a Brunch menu on the weekends until 3pm. I'd like to try that as well.\n\nhttp://www.brioitalian.com/\n\nI honestly can't wait to go back!!"
0,"I came back to this restaurant for dinner and I was very disappointed with the food and the service! Per the reviews most people recommended the lobster tacos but truly they weren't that good. The tacos were very small and nothing extraordinary. The drinks were good but a bit overpriced and the service, well the service was terrible. The restaurant had enough staff to take care of everyone but the employees were just talking to each other! The restaurant has a nice decor and great location but i would not recommend it"
1,"Egyptian/ Mediterranean meets Matthews!  Impressive Food!  Incredible Value!  The owner is a High School Student!\n\nTAKE OUT! !!!  One Table on the sidewalk which is where we ate!\n\nKabobs : Chicken Mmmmm Fantastic flavor, Skewered with Onions, Peppers and Tomato   Perfect seasoning Wonderful flavor\n\nLentil Soup!!! One of the BEST I have tasted Anywhere!\n\nRokak is simpler than Borek ground meat with multi-layers of thin dough where Borek is one thin layer of dough \n\nMacaroni Bechamel is like Mac and Cheese with Meat or Lasagna with a thick almost similar to a quiche? I think!\n\nBeautiful Beet and Red Cabbage Salad with Cilantro and ? and Nice! Red Red RED!\n\nHummus was A-OK\n\nBaklava!  Way Better than Most!  A mixture of Nuts, this \""dryer\"" version is the way I like it with minimal syrup just on the bottom here!"
1,"Just went to Hazelnuts for the first time earlier this afternoon. I walked in to the building, and was surprised that it was a very casual eatery. You simply go up to the counter, order your crepe and take a seat with your number. The place was not too busy so they brought our food out to us at the table. I ordered a make-your-own sweet crepe with strawberries, chocolate chips, and lemon (yes, the combo tasted good!). Very simple yet so tasty. The selection of the savory and the sweet crepes is quite wide and I'm sure anyone can find a combo they would like, whatever mood they are in. I went with two co-workers, one of whom ordered a savory crepe and the other a dessert crepe off the menu, both of which were delicious as well. \n\nThe one thing that would make the place better would be if they were open on the weekends or even in the evening hours to serve the date crowd or even the casual crowd. I would enjoy it if I could come in for dessert after dinner uptown or even for lunch with my husband on the weekend. Maybe they are wanting to attract the uptown lunch crowd, but I think expanding the hours would serve it well. Also, perhaps serving beer/wine would complement the crepes. Just a suggestion. \n\nOverall, a great place and will definitely be back!"
0,"this is one of those places you eat at cuz you're walking around and suddenly hunger creeps in... and walking anywhere else is really too far.  \n\nthe cheerleader-esque waitresses usually hover over their podium outside gossiping... and once in awhile one of them will look up and seat you.  \n\nand if you want to order water... its bottled only (for like $1 i believe... which is cheap for bottled water here... but expensive cuz you just wanted friggen FREE water right?)  \n\ndont order soup (fuck you diet)... it's definitely from a progresso can... you get like half a can of soup for like $5-6.  \n\ntiny and dry chicken wings...\n\nphilly cheese steak sandwich is good... except for the bread, which is COLD?!\n\n$10 all you can drink during happy hour... that's pretty sweet though."
1,"Interior wise this is more a Italian 'caf'. Not really a restaurant as such. That said I have to say that their food is very tasty and the portions are not too big. I don't mind the 'caf' look & feel as it is suited for my purposes. And do Italian places always have to be a restaurant? \n\nI do treat my visits here more as a quick snack, for a nice chat over a good coffee or even just to gather my senses. \nI like it. The staff is efficient and very helpful. The place is clean and the prices reasonable.  So it does exactly what you expect it to do - it serves Italian food that tastes good."
1,"Dos Reales was my favorite Mexican restaurant in the C-U area (as well as one of my favorite restaurants period) when I lived there a couple of years ago. This had a lot to do with the price point. Without fail, you can always get an entire meal at Dos for under $10. That is including drink and tip. What's even more amazing is the amount of food they give you for how little you pay. First, they start you out with free unlimited chips and salsa. Then, I would always chuckle to myself when they brought out my giant quesadilla I paid ~$3 for. I always felt like I was ripping them off...\n\nThe thing that really put this place over the top for me though was when we went there for a friend's birthday. They were incredibly nice and gave him a free margarita and tequila shot. Can't beat that!"
1,Last August we came to Phoenix and looked at a ton of parks to spend the winter at. We were fortunate to get a spot at this park. The slips are awesome with enough room in between them. Nice area to take the dogs for a walk and the facilities are nice and always clean. We spend about every afternoon at the hot tub and pool and we've met a lot of other great rvr's here.
1,"This place is weird - in the best way possible!  Came for dinner on a Saturday night with two friends.  Made the reservation on Open Table 3 days before - no problem.\n\nI was a bit thrown off in the beginning. You see someone at the front door, who then shows you to someone else.  That someone then walks you inside, where you are greeted by another person, and then taken to a \""holding area.\""  Then that person, after trying to sell you the $130 per person show, checks you in.  After all this, you are escorted to your table.  \n\nThe dining room is on the smaller side (as compared to other Vegas eating establishments), and has a lively, yet intimate feeling.  There is an awkward elegance about the whole thing - from the way the wait staff isdressed to the chandeliers, it all screams Mad Hatter chic.  \n\nDrink: we ordered a $45 flask filled with the most delicious vodka concoction.  The name escapes me (Blue Moon maybe?), but it was light blue in color and absolutely delicious.  We were apprehensive about the price at first, but it gave all 3 of us a very nice buzz,  and we got to keep the flask.  We almost ordered another one... almost.  \n\nFood breakdown:\n- herb brioche rolls: just the butter alone is worth the $4.  Quite possibly the best butter I've ever tasted.   \n- vegetable crudite: interesting presentation, but a pass at $15.  Veggies are baby-sized (couple of baby carrots, some baby radishes), and the mushroom floor (spongy in texture) and green goddess sauce - although nice on the palate - do not justify the price.  \n- curried cauliflower: one of my favorites.  The portion was small, but flavors were spot-on.\n- brussel sprouts: asked for it sans crispy chicken skin, and they were able to accommodate.  Tasty; cooked to perfection.   \n- heavenly eggs: extremely fragile so be careful when handling. (I learned the hard way). Small in size but big in flavor - they don't skimp on the truffle. \n- oysters on the 1/2 shell: friends enjoyed it, but stated they were \""thin.\""  I don't eat oyesters so I have no idea what that meant, and was too tipsy at that point to ask.\n- mushroom flatbread: our waiter recommended this as a vegeatarian option and it was incredibly tasty.  Not on the menu, so the accommodation was greatly appreciated.  \n- pan roasted salmon: friends thought it was the worst dish of the night\n- french fries: made with duck fat so vegetarians beware (waiter warned me). \n\nnote: that they bring the food out one or two items at a time, and in a specific order. This is tremendously beneficial for people (like myself) who cannot pace themselves while eating. It also really allows you to enjoy the ambience. \n\nEntertainment: acts will spill over from the show/bar area next door and into the dining area.  In the time we were there, we witnessed tap dancing twins, fushigi, and a man dressed like a clown playing with metallic rings (creepy).  We also caught some of the burleque/singing happenings in the other room.    \n\nAlthough there were some misses (initial arrival situation, some of the food), the whole experience was quite enjoyable and unique.  2 1/2 hours flew by and all I can remember is laughing, clapping, singing, eating, and drinking to my heart's delight.  All in all, it was money well spent, and I'll surely return the next time I'm in town."
0,"it has one star, because its required before i can tell you how HORRIBLE this location is.\nOH MY GOD!\nits like they went to fremont and hired any possible preson who was desperate for a job. a couple of the associates smelled, thats right SMELLED. like body odor. seriously? take a shower, youre in customer service let alone the FOOD BUSINESS! the kid at the register seemed as if he just got back from smoking a blunt in the back and although my order was repeated back correctly, it was received INCORRECTLY!\nwhen i went back to get them to do it right, it took 5 minutes before i had to yell to the back to get someones attention. then the person that ended up fixing what was wrong fixed it with no gloves. god knows what she was doing before considering all staff disappeared to the back. the people behind us waiting for food even said they had terrible customer service. at one point i got so tired of waiting i climbed over the counter for ketchup. on top of all that, when my boyfriend got his food, it looked like the person who made the sandwich got hungry and gouged a piece of chicken right out of the center THEN proceeded to put it on the bun. food looked old, overcooked, dry, disgusting! \ni ended up handing everything back and demanding a refund.\nabsolutely ridiculous staff!\nstart hiring people with educations and people that show respect to those around them by BATHING. this place needs to be start over from scratch. from building to employees.\nworst KFC, ever!"
1,"Purchased a great pair of sunglasses from here last week. They have a great selection of high quality sunglasses and eyeglasses. The staff was friendly, helpful and knowledgeable about styles.\nPrices are comparable to online shopping.\nWill definitely purchase sunglasses from here again!"

0,"SUPER SLOW! Never been to such a slow Cafe Rio. There was no one in line, but it too 10-15 minutes to get food. Poorly organized staff."
1,I really enjoyed the breakfast. I had the short rib benedict and my friend had the green chili pork tostada with 2 eggs over easy on top. For the restaurant just being open for 2 days I thought all in all things were good.  We sat at the bar and had very good service and the prices we very reasonable. I will be going back for breakfast at least once a week.
1,a great little spot!  It was a drive becuase I normally go to N. Scottsdale places but yelp did not lead me astray.  It's a cross between a coffee shop and a deli.  I had the chicken salad and pasta salad and they were both really good!
0,"I'd been looking forward to eating at this restaurant for several months as it always seemed to pop up when I was looking for places to eat around downtown. This particular Friday night was finally a night where both my boyfriend and I decided that some good Mexican food was in order and we arrived just after 8pm.\n\nWe arrive and park in back and had no problems finding a parking spot. We come through the back door which is always slightly intimidating in my opinion but we stroll on through and make our way to the hostest stand. We were met by a man who asked how many in our party and our name. No smile or a welcoming Hello. Maybe he was just having a bad day. We were told we had a 20 minute wait. We walk the 5 steps over the bar and decide to order a beer while we waited. Unfortunately, the bartender had just stepped away and didn't come back for at least another 15 minutes. As we finally order our beer and she hands them to us, our table is ready. We are sat on the other side of the restaurant, near the back of the room next to the waiter stand with the registers and the bathroom. I HATE getting sat back here. I get that someone has to sit there but for me, it takes away from the whole experience of the restaurant and clearly dampens the ambiance. Our waiter arrived after another wait and he must have been having a bad day too because there was no smile, no hello, it was just \""What would you like to drink?' and a quick run down of their menu. At this point I'm beginning to think that maybe this place isn't known for their service and am hopeful their food will make up for it. \n\nWe order the tableside guacamole. I get that this is normally an expensive appetizer and you pay for the presentation but for the price, you usually get someone who doesn't have a scowl on their face and using the shabby metal cart that was sitting next to us at the waiter stand. All the extra ingredients for the guac were placed under a towel and once he finished, he placed the towel back over it and wheeled it back into the corner. Fancy. The guac was good but not worth the cost in my opinion. I WILL be adding pomegranate seeds to my own this summer though as that was an interesting addition and would be great in the summer!\n\nMy boyfriend ordered a dish that was some sort of pepper stuffed with meat and cheese that he liked but didn't finish, which is a rarity for him. I ordered their house special, the cochinita pibil which is a slow roasted pork with steamed veggies and mashed potatoes. The pork tasted like something that could have come out of my crockpot. Yes it was tender and the flavor was...well, like a pork roast. Nothing special about it at all. The mashed potatoes had some additional ingredients and were the best thing on my plate but the steamed veggies were just that, with a little seasoning. Pretty bland. \n\nOverall, between the lack luster service, sitting in the worst spot in the restaurant, and the okay food, we have to many other places to try and will never be back."
1,Called this morning after I noticed my outside spigot was leaking and frozen.  Stan was very friendly and sent a team within 30 minutes.  The two guys who arrived were great and finished the repair quickly.  The talked to me in advance of doing any work and even provided cost estimates. Discussed options were and helped me decide the best course.  The cost was reasonable and I will definitely call again if I need plumbing work.\nThanks - Christine
0,"Thai Food Corner is a new quaint little place near work.  I was inquiring about some of my favorite dishes, and they didn't make it with chicken, but with pork instead.  That was the first bad sign.  I ordered my food medium spice, and it was spicy as heck with green chili and red chili pepper seeds.  I have had Thai medium many places, and it has never been this hot.  Be careful how you order here."
1,"In addition to the outstanding food and service, the servers at the bar were friendly and showed genuine interest in new and regular customers. Their Italian food and wine selection are excellent, but this time around I tried their grilled salmon. A very busy place but worth the short wait."
1,"Talk about a buffet you MUST go to! THIS is the place to go for endless portions of high quality food. There are tons of options to choose from when it comes to buffets in Vegas and a lot of people that the buffets at Rio and Bellagio are hard to beat, and if that's the case, Wicked Spoon definitely gives those places a run for its money. If you the opportunity to go to Wicked Spoon....don't argue, just go! .....NOW! Haha\n\nThe Place -\nThere isn't anything too special about the place; however the tables and chairs are definitely of good quality and they keep the place really clean. If it weren't for the obvious buffet stations and people constantly getting up for their 3rd of 4th plates, you can sometimes forget that you're in a buffet at all!\n***** 5/5 Stars *****\n\nThe Service -\nI was in town for a conference and, coming here before, I just KNEW I had to come here again to their delicious brunch options. Even though it's a buffet, that does not mean excellent customer service is NOT required and Wicked Spoon definitely delivers. The cashiers were all very friendly and always had smiles on their faces. The hostess who took me to my seat was very social, nice, and struck up general conversation as we walked. As soon as I sat down, I was approached by the waiter responsible for my section and he immediately took my drink order. The drinks stayed full and he was always asking if I needed anything else or if everything was ok. Really great job, guys!\n**** 4/5 Stars ****\n\nThe Food -\nIf I wrote about all the food options they offer, I'm sure I would exceed the character limit for Yelp Reviews and would also be forced to split it into various chapters haha. So with that being said, EVERYTHING here is delicious and of GREAT quality. What really makes Wicked Spoon unique, however, is their method of presenting certain entrees. Some dishes, like the fried chicken, come in their own miniature deep fry basket that you put on your plate and others come in ramekins or miniature griddles, such as the mac & cheese and others. There's a typical carvery with fresh cooked meats and during brunch, there's an omelette station that also offers egg white omelettes should you want one. The salads and fruit options are all fresh and in that same section, freshly carved deli meats are available as well....reminded me much of a charcuterie. Before this portion goes on forever, I'm just gonna leave it at Wicked Spoon not having a bad thing on their offerings. Like I said, EVERYTHING is delicious and everyone should be able to find something appealing to their taste buds and palette.\n**** 4/5 Stars ****\n\nOverall -\nI try and make it a point to come to Wicked Spoon every time I come to Vegas. While the Bellagio buffet is still pretty good, it's outdated...and while the Rio is regarded as having one of the best buffets in Vegas, it's a little ways off the strip and can sometimes be an inconvenience. Wicked Spoon is situated, conveniently, on The Strip and offers great food on top of that. If you're looking for a buffet that separates itself from the rest with delicious food, look no further and come to Wicked Spoon! I promise, you won't regret it! Thanks!"
1,"This place serves the best Prime Rib I have had anywhere bar none.\nLocated a bit off the strip this place gets overlooked but boy its worth a 10-15 min walk I took to come here. \nI didn't have any reservations and had to wait in the bar area for a bit nevertheless I enjoyed one of the better martinis in the city. The main dinning area is old school with service to match (it reminded me of the bygone era of fine dinning shown in Mad Men). Though its Las Vegas and I saw people in casual clothes I would recommend dressing up when coming here. \nService was immaculate from start to finish. I ordered a shrimp cocktail for starters  which was served nicely chilled. The cocktail sauce was OK and the shrimp were large but run of the mill stuff. \nFor the main I went with the Lawry's cut of Prime Rib and ordered it rare.\nSalad was done table side an ode to old school fine dining. I am not much of a salad eater but this one was good and consisted of Crisp romaine and iceberg lettuce, baby spinach, shredded beets, chopped eggs and croutons, tossed with their Vintage Dressing.\nNext came the main event a nice rolling trolley  with huge chunks of Prime Rib was brought table side and the meat was carved to my liking by an expert chef.  The main's come with an unlimited supply of Yorkshire pudding (very good) Mashed potatoes (OK) jus sauce (memorable) and Whipped cream horseradish but beef is the star attraction here. It is amazing how good the prime rib is and it is cooked to perfection. My cut was perfectly pink all around with a good meat to fat ratio. The crust was seasoned well and gave a nice contrast. I ordered some cream corn and mushrooms which were good as well but I don't think were needed as the main serving was generous. \nI wanted to try some desserts but I was full.\nI must mention again how good the service was, my needs were anticipated and the servers would disappear after picking up stuff and refilling wine and water and not even once I had to look for them. \nWine selection is extensive though I didn't explore it much and stuck to a Cabernet.\nThere you have it folks Las Vegas the way it was envisioned initially!\n4.5 Stars!"
1,"Outstanding halibut special last night!   Very tender cut perfectly grilled.  I would have given 5 stars but it needed something else besides 5 very small spears of asparagus on the side.  Knowledgable wait staff.  I took a friend visiting from Kansas City to enjoy the beautiful patio view looking out over the city lights.  This has to be one of the best patio views in North Scottsdale.  Very talented vocalist playing acoustic guitar.  A lovely way to spend a relaxing evening.  A best kept secret, but please share!"
1,"My friend said to me \""I'm craving a hot dog\"" so I said \""let's try Buldogis\""! And I said it with that amount of enthusiasm! I've been dying to try this place. We drove for what seemed like forever to get here and then drove around the shopping center trying to locate this place, and then it was like the clouds parted and the sun shined down right on the entrance. We decided to be conservative and share two dogs and fries, we chose the Banh Mi and the Chicago dog (I've been craving one since my Chicago trip) wow it was a toss up which one we liked better. Banh Mi was so tasty, the pork belly was perfect with the sriracha mayo and slaw, while the Chicago dog wasn't the same as a true Chicago dog, it was a really good attempt and I would order it again. And then.......the Angry Kimchi Fries, we were so full my the time we got to this, but we couldn't stop eating them! I need to go back and try the Hawaiian dog next and the Euro fries!"
0,"ouch they went WAYYY down in my ratings,\n\nservice was horrible, it took 10 minutes to get seated and it wasn't busy and there were empty tables everywhere... server took 15 minutes to get us waters, server forgot what i ordered and didn't even remember my soup till prompted that my food should come with it. (20 minutes after everyone else got theirs)\n\nfood under cooked, they served some of the steak strip cooked black and blue style...\n\nfood served COLD, not hot, not warm..but.. COLD!! gross\n\nwasabi is the crappy powder kind"
1,"We visited this little restaurant last week and it was great! It is a family owned business and everyone working was super nice and eager to please. The pizza was delicious and fresh and some of the best I have had. Everything is made in house and you can tell. We also got the pasta bolognese which was good. While waiting for our takeout I saw a plate of spaghetti and meatballs go by and it looks amazing, something I will have to try next time. The only cons would be that it lacks in decor and is very small, but something that is easy to get over since the food is outstanding. It is also very clean (which is a must) so if you are looking for a casual place to grab dinner, or just to get takeout, please give this place a chance!"
1,"When purchasing clothes, this place is a virtual haven for great finds, but I would not sell my used clothes here. I came here with a friend when she was cleaning out her closet. For three big bags, containing big name clothes and shoes, she received a meager amount of money. Yet then they turn around and charge three or four times as much for it. It is not because they sell it for a ridiculous price, the atrocity comes from how much they give for good quality items. It is better to just donate your clothes to a charity that gives it straight to the people. That way you can rake in some good karma.\n\nAlthough I do not condone selling here, I am a fan of shopping here. There is nothing more rewarding that to find the perfect pair of vintage jeans for less than ten bucks, or a chunky cardigan in an obscure color. I know that my advice does not add up. Without people selling to this place then how would I be able to buy? Good thing not everyone heeds my advice, if they did, I would be looking to go into politics or becoming a cult leader. It is better, for the world, that not everyone follow my lead. Sometimes my own friends regret following me."
1,"The Zinburger was one of the best burgers I have ever eaten   I usually like a lot of stuff on my burger, but this didn't need anything more than the cheese, zin grilled onions, and some lettuce.  Just perfect. \n\nOverall, the place was very nice, but pricey.  For the price of the burgers, they should include a serving of fries, but you have to order those separately.  Their fries say they serve 2, but that is a stretch.  Two sensible servings perhaps, but if you are eating a burger, who's being sensible?\n\nI would go back, and I would recommend this to friends, but only because the burger was THAT good."
0,"Not much to say but they were short handed, Is that restaurants excuse for bad service?"
0,"Great service, great atmosphere, sashimi is ok, not the freshest game in town, very reasonable though..."
1,Very unique and tasty food.  The service was okay and timely.  I had the steak tacos which were very good and wife had the grilled chicken on a bed of grains and lentils (very very good).  The Pumpkin bundt cake was insanely good.
1,"From the start I had a bit of a chip on my shoulder from the reservation making process. \n\nMonday morning I find out that I need to make a reservation for 8 people for dinner that night, at 5:30 or 6 p.m. So I quickly get on the phone with the Keg who's answering machine says they are closed but to leave a message and someone will get back to me. Well 5 hours later no one had called me back yet, so I tried again, same thing, I pressed \""zero\"" thinking maybe this would work, it did, I got someone in an office somehow. I explained to them what I needed and had been waiting for a phone call back for hours. He didn't seem very concerned, and took my information again, and said someone would call me back. Great! More waiting around. Business dinner, kinda important people, cant wait around all day. \n\nSo I wait, and the hostess calls me back about 15 minutes later. She had a bit of an attitude. She mad it seem like a hassle for us to want to be coming in for dinner. I wasn't sure how quickly we would be able to get there and it might be closer to 6 than 5:30, this was unacceptable to her, \""Its going to have to be 5:30\"" Again I explained we would be there as soon as we could. Hello! 8 people, business dinner, one check, minimum $40 a head, what is the problem? You say great see you then and hang up, don't give me shit! I can just as easiyly take the group somewhere else. She told me that the servers would be standing around wondering where the table was and that is why we had to be there by 5:30, NO! Sorry we are not here to cater to the server, Ugh! Sorry done ranting but it was very rude, and for the money we planned to spend I really don't think I needed to deal with the Spanish Inquisition to make dinner reservations. \n\nWhatever, long story short, we showed up when we did, sat down when we pleased, all was okay in the world. Dinner was fantastic! The server was a doll, helped to suggest a great wine, walked us through the menu perfectly. Everything was essentially seamless. The timing was perfect! This is  probably one of the hardest things to get right in a place like this, and they nailed it. \n\nSo all in all, even though the hostess gave me a hard time, we had a blast. \n\nThank you!\n\nPS: Get the mushrooms and garlic mashed, with whatever cut of meat you get, they are all good!"
1,Wow! Great show. So much packed into it. We got 50% off tickets. Great bargain
0,I'm glad I had a BOGO coupon! I will give this place another try if I have another coupon.  08/24/2013 Update - I have yet to return.
0,"omg    think about this.... I paid 250k for one painting   65k for another   and 98k for a third.OVER $400,000..now under any ones belief thats a damn good customer... !!!!\n\nI asked for an appraisal Mr Perry was very nice ...  initially because i needed it for insurance purposes...  then came 3 weeks later  still no appraisal ....so i called again...i was then told its coming...  then pressure was on me from my insurance agency and still no appraisal  Out of nowhere over a month later it shows up in the mail....  \nSo even though I was upset..i bit my tongue and thanked Mr Perry.  His response was that I was suppose to realize even though he told me during the process it was coming any day.three times ..I was suppose to know that appraisals take time and  5 weeks was normal..   not once  prior to receiving it ...did he ever tell me ..it would take anywhere near 5 weeks... Mr perry lives in his own world...  ask others...and real other reviews...I smiled when reading some of the negative ones. It seems so real to me...\n\nBut heres the kicker...Mr Perry knows that they have some kind of deal where they must take back and or exchange for paintings similar in prices..honestly i cant remember because it was  a while ago...but they tekl you something comforting when you buy the painting....   So instead of ever being in a situation that the prices I was sold cant be reasonably achieved .... Mr Perry chose..totally out of the blue... to tell me he no longer will do business with me.. \n\n\nBe careful big buyers...if this is how they treated me...then wow  what about  you guys..  its been a while since this happened ,...but when i read some of the other buyers reviews I felt it was good for others to beware!!!      They really were great when i was buying..they couldnt have been nicer...   but then again what salesmen isnt??"
0,"$18 per day resort fee for nothing!!!  This was a nice hotel but now is outdated and over-priced.  stay at the Palms or Mirage, much better for a lower price"
0,"Based on atmosphere and looks alone, this place should smash the opposition out of the park, but I've been three times now and I won't be back. \n\nThe service is so so so slow. I recently stood at the counter for 20 minutes, two tills, only one operating. Frustrating.\n\nThe cakes etc lie out for people to inspect, breath and no doubt sneeze all over. You also have to gather your own jam etc. I hate gathering my own jam.\n\nThe coffee takes too long to come and when it does, it is far from hot enough.\n\nThat's my summary. When compared to the likes of Peter's Yard, this place needs to get its act together..."

1,Outstanding. my wife and I are foodies. We shared the Omakase six course. Enough food for 2 to share. Outstanding wagyu strawberry dish. Also amazing the Atlantic Salmon with orange. Mike the Waiter was great. Overall excellent service. Will come back soon!!!
1,One of the best Mexican restaurants around. Looks like nothing on the outside but you'll feel right at home on the inside. Get anything on the menu and try not to fill up on the chips.
1,Ordered delivery and the food got to me within 30 minutes! The food was a little expensive but worth the price. I had the buffalo chicken pasta (can't recall the exact name) and the New Orleans pasta (can't recall the exact name)  they were both really good! I would order from here again
1,"Waking up at 11am in Vegas leaves little for the imagination when it comes to food. We still wanted breakfast, but also wanted to make it to the pool so we could find lounge chairs! We figured walking through the MGM on the way to the pool we'd find SOMETHING, but to no luck. Pub 1842 was our only option, and even they didn't open until 11:30.\n\nWe were the second customers to get in, and we sat at the bar for faster service. Although our bartender didn't know a lot about the breakfast menu, we picked something quickly. We ordered the Andouille sausage sandwich, which he told us came with fries.\n\nWe were very pleasantly surprised. The sandwich was so good! The bread used was like a thin version of Texas toast, without all the carbs. It was delicious, and almost melted in your mouth. The fries served with the sandwich were also amazing! They were heavily seasoned, with something like a general seasoning salt, but they were delish! \n\nI would definitely come back for that sandwich. We shared it between the two of us and we couldn't even make a dent in the fries."
0,"So not only was \""Paco\"" extremely rude but he refused to give us two waters. He apparently gave us one, but refused to give us a second and said we needed to pay for the second. I don't care if there are or are not any dram shop acts in Las Vegas, but you cannot deny water to people you've been serving alcohol to.  Especially when I know for a fact, and I have proof, that they were serving 19 year olds alcohol. Of course \""Paco\"" who was extremely rude tried to deny alcohol and charge for it was completely out of line.  A bartender should NEVER be required to ask for permission to serve water to a customer no matter what the circumstances are."
0,"DO NOT COME HERE! they charge a minimum of $10 per person no matter what! if u don't order, $10. if u order something less than $10, they still charge u $10. RIDICULOUS! I came here to meet some friends. it's a very small Chinese karaoke bar with only 6 tables and a very minimal drink selection. when we were ready to leave, we find our check at $80+ when we only ordered a couple appetizers and a few drinks. they have a menu and say it's over 3 years and prices have changed. really? this place must be doing bad because they can't afford new menus! i left this place feeling robbed.\n\nIF I CAN GIVE THIS PLACE NEGATIVE RATING, I WOULD!!!"
0,"Decided to go here with my girlfriend for a quick meal on 12/30/13. We had an appointment later on that afternoon so we told our waiter we were in a hurry.  \n\nThe ambiance is pretty nice, but the main problem was the cold attitude of the staff. We had to find our own menus behind the bar and were left unattended to for about 5 minutes after we sat down. All of the staff was attending to a mixed up food order of another gentleman sitting at the bar. We should have taken this as an omen. \n\nAnyway, we ordered two normal burgers, but veggie burger style instead. We also had carbonated waters. After about 20 minutes, and still no burgers, I had to ask for the check because we were in a hurry and I didn't want to have to deal with it later. We saw an errant $8.00 charge on the bill, and when we asked what it was for, the waiter said that we were getting a normal burger, with a veggie patty on top of the beef patty. I was dumbfounded- when you ask for one style of burger \""with a veggie burger instead\"" I'd expect only a veggie party, not a veggie patty on top of a beef patty. Amazing. \n\nAnyway, he proceeded to fill our half empty carbonated water with normal still water as we were finishing up. Surprisingly, the food was actually really good once they fixed the order. Nice quinoa veggie patty, a soft brioche bun, and fresh ingredients. And great fries! \n\nFix the service and it's a great lunch spot. Until then, avoid."
0,"Comic Bowling... DJ's...Lasers... sounds like fun don't it??? Well I thought it was going to be fun, according to their website I was picturing a dark, glow in the dark bowling alley with lasers and loud blaring music and drinking.  Hmm Hmm.. Went to cosmic bowling with a group of friends. Well we get there right when comic bowling starts... They had shut down all the lanes and started a line of people to start getting everyone ready.  Right away I noticed the crowd of people..  not what I was expecting...There were a lot of kids out late at night and still jumping and running around, and when I say kids I mean 3,4 and 5 year old's.  Finally got our lane and I was expecting it to get really dark so we could enjoy the black lights..  Nope didn't really happen, it still stayed pretty light in the bowling alley, and the lasers sucked.. Then I started waiting for the DJ and loud music.. ummm no.. that didn't happen either... they had put on some really bad music video's that we couldn't even hear over the bowling balls rolling down, which was probably a blessing.  Then we go to the bar to pick up some pitchers of beers, not any good beers on tap and the ones they had were super expensive for this dive place.. We stayed cause we paid money to play.. We left around 1:30am, and the kids were still running around like crazy, I kept thinking to myself, what the F**k are all these kids doing up at this time... I won't be going back.."
0,"What's your opinion of an MD who wears a three piece suit?  When I see a doctor wearing a three piece suit, the first thing that comes to my mind is, why is he wearing a suit?  Did he wear a suit to class in med school?  Did he wear a suit doing rounds during residency?  I know lawyers and investment bankers wear suits, but doctors?  I want to see my doctor in  a white coat.   Who wears a suit if they don't have to?  Am I obsessed with what people wear?  Not normally, but when an MD dresses in a suit, then I can't stop wondering why...  You get the picture.  To me, there's something not right about a doctor under the age of seventy wearing a suit.  I could spend this review just commenting about workplace attire, but I need to move on.\n\nDr Stevens performs surgery at HIS surgery center - YIKES!   I hate doctors who have a business in addition to their practice.  They see patients in the office, they do surgery at THEIR surgery center. There's a conflict of interest here:  is it possible that patients who may not need surgery are scheduled for a procedure to pay for all that expensive equipment.  I HATE INCORPORATED DOCTORS!! The Gucci loafers.  The conferences in New York, Anaheim, Orlando, Miami, etc.  Making $200K  from a regular practice isn't enough?  Are you a doctor or a businessman?   What's more important:  helping the sick or your bottom line (like I want a new boat that costs $260,000 and the down payment is $26,000 so I need to get 23 surgeries done in the next 3 weeks to get that payment together).  If I want you to do my surgery at the Mayo Clinic is this possible?   I want to have surgery at a hospital.  Because, let's say something goes wrong.  Drastically wrong, like I stop breathing.  When this happens in a hospital they call code blue and every available doctor and nurse runs as fast as they can and does their best to get you breathing again.  In a surgery center there may not be any other doctors and there may not even be a nurse.  People die in surgery centers.    When I hear surgery center, I think of people getting liposuction and dying from blood loss in the recovery room because the doctor left and no trained medical staff are available.  \nDr Stevens is arrogant:   i was extremely ill when I had a consultation with him. I had quite a few questions to ask about my situation.  Dr. Stevens kept writing and wouldn't look me in the eye when he deigned to answer my questions.  He kept looking at his notepad.  Damn it:  stop writing, lift up your head and look at me when I'm talking to you.  While I'm in the middle of this, it began to hit me that this was not the doctor for me.  I'm paying for the consultation, I could barely walk, it was June - so it was HOT outside.  I was exhausted, had been out of work for several weeks.  Was facing back surgery and trying to find a surgeon. He said he does the procedure i need all the time.  Maybe that was true, but he would NOT be doing this on me. As I was walking to the garage so I could collapse in my car, I was almost ready to give up.  I knew I had to go home, get on the internet and find a doctor that I liked.   I ended up  going with  Dr. Mark Lyons, a neurosurgeon at the Mayo Clinic."
1,"Great course for beginners. It's not anything special and isn't kept up very well, but it's a good place to practice and a great course to walk."
0,They got my order wrong and I told them and said I was a liar and refused to help me. It was the worst customer service I have seen in awhile.
1,"Really like Grimaldi's when I am craving for some New York coal fired brick oven Pizza. It definitely has it's own unique taste and is a treat. Yummo.\n\nBeen to a few of their other locations and each one is slightly different inside and out. This one has a nice covered patio when you are in the mood for partying outside.\n\nNormally get there when they open and go with a 16\"" Sausage, Pepperoni and Shrooms. Seen a version of a Pesto Pizza brought to the table next to me and it looked and smelled awesome. I'm getting hungry just writing this review.\n\nVery friendly and prompt service during the lunch hour. What I like most is they will bring you extra shakers to spike up your NY pie. Some extra garlic, parmesan cheese, a good sprinkle of oregano and a large amount crushed chili peppers gets me jumping. Nice!\n\nThis location is in the top secret DC Ranch. I say top secret because it is tricky even seeing it from the street. Good thing we know friends that live nearby and take us to other restaurants in THE RANCH. Use your GPS if it helps. GIDDY UP!"
0,Tried the fish tacos and they weren't really exciting. The place seems like a nice place to hang out and grab some drinks with friends but it's not worth a special trip.
1,"We've been coming here for years now and for a summer cool down it's the place to be. They have many different flavors and you can pick extra toppings if you want them and there are lots to choose from. I always try to stay with 2 flavors, but always seem to check out any new offerings. The yogurt is charged by weight and the price seem very reasonable. Get a punch card if you are going to be a repeat customer. They now have a pinball machine, donkey kong and another video game in the back room, what makes it even better is they games are FREE! Ooooo, I let the cat out of the bag :-("
1,"Amazing! Don't let the strip mall deter you since most amazing little gems are usually hidden in strip malls it seems. \n\nI had the Beach House burger which was super favorable. The pico mixed with smoked mozzarella and green chili. Wow.. Had the sweet potato tots and BBQ chips which were both tasty. \n\nFriends ordered the French Toast fries which weren't my thing (don't like French toast in the first place, I know I'm weird) but he was in love. \n\nWe will definitely be back as I want to try their tacos and carnival corn."
1,"As a restaurant it was good, however I was expecting so much more since it had the name \""Alain Ducasse\"" attached to it. Food was good, but not spectacular and doesn't have the same quality compared to L'atelier Joel Robuchon down the street. You don't sense or feel any of the \""Ducasse\"" or \""3 Michelin Star\"" mystique. The service was good, but it was perfunctory, lacked the extra polish, and they made some major mistakes with the bill. They added the neighboring tables bill on to mine! Of course they took care of it, but still.....Anyways, when you go, just don't have super high expectations and you'll be fine. I would go again but order less food and enjoy the view. My positive ratings are biased toward the ambience rather than the food or service."
1,"Great hotel, relaxing away from the chaos and. Didn't give it 5 stars because my bathroom shower was clogged and they were unable to repair it before I had to leave for dinner. Also the tv reception is sporadic and just flat out didn't work at one point.\n\nEverything else was as expected. Larger than average basic room which was very nice.\n\nThis hotel is valet only FYI. A little confusing when looking for the self parking for a first time guest.\n\nI would recommend this place and will keep it as an option for myself in the future."
1,Been here on multiple occasions and I enjoy the place. Simple rolls that are good and the happy hour is always awesome. Would be 5 stars is service was better.
0,"Ever since they changed format this station has been downhill...\nits also annoying they play out the same song  in the same hour....\nMaybe its me, I find some of the dj's voices annoying as hell....\n\nand a station that plays the jonas brothers? this world is goin to hell...."
1,"It was great Korean food! Lunch prices were good. \u00a36-8 per pate. Great appetisers  and best of all EVERYONE LOVED what they got! And I went with a tough group to please . \nI haven't found too many Korean restaurants in Scotland, and this one some of my Taiwanese friends found by accident when were were going to the Portrait Gallery. \nThey were all so happy to find such great Korean food  in Edinburgh. Just as good as Kim's they said. \nWill come again for lunch some time!\nAlso a very nice place, well decorated, good seating, and good table service."
1,"The beans.... Oh the beans! And they're complimentary. Along with the Fideo soup. Oh, man! I would eat just that, it makes me so nostalgic for meals from my past.  With that said, everything we have tried has been very good. We have been here a few times and have not been disappointed. The parking lot is a hot mess and the seating area is small but once you sit down and they bring the complimentary beans, salsa, chips and soup I am already so happy that I end up ordering a small meal to share with someone! So if you want to get off the strip and have a good, more authentic Mexican meal head over to Viva Zapatas!"
0,"Not impressed. Tried them for the first time ordering takeout. Quick delivery, but the pizza and garlic knots were not cooked completely. Raw dough was not very appetizing.  I called the manager to let them know, he offered to give me credit, but a better solution would have been to cook another pizza and deliver it again.  Not sure if we'll order from them again."
1,"When staying at the boulders you have complementary use of the spa facilities. My husband and I love going to the children free pool, lounging all day, ordering delicious healthy breakfast and using the facilities. The spa has your standard spa items sauna, steam room, huge showers etc. The only thing I would change is a better magazine selection."
1,"Stayed here for a friends wedding and it was excellent.  The rooms are expensive, but they have been redone.  This hotel was built in the 80's and the grounds are above par.  They have a 3 level pool with a bar in the middle.  Works for me!  The golf course is  really nice.\n\nThe staff is excellent and the rooms were really nice.  Make sure to use your Starwood Guest Number. If you like cactus, stay here."
1,"Almost a year ago, I sauntered in this very unLas Vegas treasure after shopping at Trader Joe's.  There's something about this place that gave me goosebumps.  Perhaps, this is the effect of being surrounded by all these used and old books.  It was like finding a sliver of San Francisco's City Lights Bookstore.  This is the place to go to when you have grown weary of the life of excess, but still have time to kill and feed your mind and soul."

0,"The restaurant looks inviting, and like a good time. However, the two pizzas i've eaten there have been rather subpar, and the service has been some of the worst in the city. Both times i've been there we waited 15 minutes until someone came to our table. That's about what can sum up this place. Others may enjoy, because it brings one of the few more upscale restaurants to oakland, but it still just does not do it for me."
0,"The people in charge of opening this place have no clue what they're doing. We came in on Sunday evening. There were several, several tables open both inside and outside but we were quoted a 30 minute wait because the kitchen was backed up. At 45 minutes, still with several tables open, they still weren't sure when they could seat us. It didn't help the receptionists were approx. 15 years old, unprofessional, and clueless. I will be boycotting this place for a while."
1,"This is a great place for dinner. It's like stepping back in time..the way Las Vegas was in the 50's & 60's.,..we have eaten their twice and the food was delicious. I had the gallows with clams and my wife had Vinny's ala vodka.  The entertainment is a gentleman singing frank Sinatra songs. A nice thing is they have a 2 for 1 on Tuesdays for locals"
1,Best sushi in town. Great service and tasty little dishes sent out by the chef before the meal.
0,"Probably some of the worst Chinese food I've ever had.  Husband ordered the shrimp in lobster sauce & it was flavorless.  Shrimp was mushy as if they were overcooked.  I ordered chow mein & the noodles were overdone, sticky and the taste was bland as well.  Also ordered chicken fried rice & that was unflavored too.  Everything tasted bad.  We won't be back.  Very disappointed that ordering 3 dishes cost $30."
0,"I did not enjoy my experience here.  \n\nService - Very slow.  I was in a larger party but we had to flag the waiter down just to get our initial order taken.  Meals came out at different times which was awkward when you're out to dinner with friends!\n\nFood - I hate to give such a bad review but I'm going to give the truth here (because you CAN handle it ;).  The calamari and crab rangoons were the worst I have ever had.  The calamari had no flavor and looked exactly like Burger King onion rings.  Not to mention that the portion was very tiny.  The rangoons had barely any filling.  As for my main entree, I went with the sushi.  On the Tuna Lover's I actually had to scrape the topping off.  I think it was supposed to be some type of tuna pate? It was awful.  I actually just left some sushi behind which is very not like me since I'm a sushi addict.\n\nAtmosphere - We sat on the patio and it was a nice view with adequate seats/tables.  Bathrooms were clean and hostess was welcoming.\n\nOverall, some of the worst food I've had in a long time.  Two thumbs down!"
0,This company did a terrible job. They come once a week spend about 3 to 4 minutes and charge ridiculous amount of money they would constantly leave the gate to the pool open they would never sweep the sides of the pool after numerous complaints we had to terminate  service they are a total waste of time and money  do not give them your cell phone number unless you want a ridiculous amount of texts they are just bad news.

0,"This is clearly for visitors of the City who don't have time or cannot be bothered to head to Loch Ness itself. Add some 3D and some fairytales (or scientific evidence- whatever way you want to look at it) you get to see hand on evidence around the myths surrounding this loch. Most of the evidence comes from the (slightly derranged) individuals who spent a lot of time looking at the lake. Or devising machines to proove their point. You can proove anything with facts these days. And photos.\n\nAfter your Loch Ness Discovery troop over to the Loch itself if you have time. You are going to spend the first 5-15 minutes starring at it as well, convinced that  that movement in the distance is Nessie herself.

I'm not a bagel connoisseur, but I can confidently say that Poppy's are quite good.  \n\nI had a turkey on Honey Wheat bagel.  The sliced meat tasted very fresh and seemed to be of high quality.  They use very spicy mustard- -which is awesome.  I ordered mine with lettuce and tomato, both were fine.  The bagel, itself, was just the right level of crusty on the outside/soft on the inside.  It had a nice, nutty flavor too. \n\nThe service was okay.  It took a little while, and they seemed a little disorganized, but not a big deal at all. The space is attractive and clean.   The chairs and tables are crammed in a little tight for my taste, but- - again- - no biggie.  I'll definitely try Poppy's again.  I am much more of a morning-bagel person, so I look forward to going near breakfast time."
1,"I've stayed here a few times and have always enjoyed it.  But I will tell you, that you can hear the thump thump thump of the music being played at the pool and clubs till 4 am in the morning, so be cautions of what side of the building you stay.\n\nThe rooms are remarkable, clean and modern.  It's a big place, and they offer tons of stuff for almost any demographic.  Put on your walking shoes, because it's a big place and you'll be on your feet a lot.  Hope you enjoy it here as much as we did."
1,"As usual everything was delicious!  We get the watermelon mintini, chicken tika masala, palak paneer, lamb vindaloo, vegatable raita, and the bhatura, (Sp?). Whatever we don't finish we bring home and it tastes even better the next day!"
1,"I came into this place a long time ago when they first opened and didn't think too much of it.  This weekend though, I stopped in while getting an oil change nearby.  This place seems much bigger than it used to be.  Not entirely sure if it really is, or just seems that way.  If you are into comics, this place is huge, has a huge selection of comics, books, toys, boardgames etc.  Apparently they also have game nights, where people bring in games just to play with other people which sounds like something that would be fun for some. While I was there, kids were playing Magic or something like that on one of the big tables they have setup in the game area.  I didn't see much at all in the way of \""sports\"", but they did have a little bit.  I would recommend this place to anyone who enjoys comics.  They sell cards, and card boxes as well.  This would be a great place to get started on any comic collections, or getting into any of the role playing games that are currently available.  Although I am not into either of those, I can appreciate the store for what it has to offer.  One last thing to mention, I don't really know how prices compare to other places since I am not really a comic collector or game player."
0,"Analogy for this hotel\nExterior is to fancy as Room is to Ugly.\n\nThis is a really outdated hotel here on the strip.Be aware that this hotel was built in 1999.Since then,they never renovated their level entry rooms,even up to 2014.Really ugly hotel!\nI didn't like it because of its cheap furniture.This is one of the cheap European-themed hotels.They didn't have a flat-screen television in 2012(For Cheapest room)they use the huge boxed CRT televisions.EVEN LUXOR(BAD HOTEL)HAS A FLAT SCREEN TELEVISION. Don't stay here unless it's free.STEP UP THIS CRAPPY HOTEL!This hotel is worse than Monte Carlo(Check my review on that).\n\n*You may be thinking European-themed hotels are \""high classed\"".WELL NOT THIS ONE!!When I entered the hallway to my room,I had a bad impression already because of the ugly decor and cheap furniture.Stay away from this Low-End hotel.UGLY,CHEAP,CRAPPY,LOW ENDED,BAD,HORRIBLE, HORRENDOUS HOTEL!!The cheapness to keep this hotel outdated for 14 years is UNACCEPTABLE!\nSTAY AWAY FROM THIS \""LOW CLASS\"" RESORT!This is one of the hotels that tries too hard be something fancy.But since you are paying a low price for this Shit,everything is cheap.\n\nTip For Hotel Companies:Cheap hotels should NEVER try to be fancy,keep it simple.\n\nGo to Caesar's Palace,more high classed than this hotel. :)"
1,"Wanna know how to tell when your lunch salad is REALLY good?\n\nWhen you \""drool a little bit\"" in between bites, like I did today with my Chopped Turkey Salad from La Grande Orange.\n\nI went there on Sunday 10-24, and to be honest, the setup is a little confusing for newcomers.  Order on THIS side, pickup food on THAT side, come back to THIS side to get dessert.  It's enough to make you want to just get in the car and drive home.  But DON'T !!!\n\nIf it weren't for the \""Drool Event\"" which occurred today, I probably would not have posted this review at all.\n\nI shared the Green Chile Burger with my daughter, and we were both underwhelmed, really.  Nothing awesome about the burger.  Oh, it's FAR better than fast food burgers, but it's not comparable to Lobby's or Chuckbox (my two top burgers in town, probably.)  The french fries were a little thin and not too memorable really.\n\nMy son had the wings and loved them  But a hitch - I SPECIFICALLY requested RANCH for the wings, and they came out with Blue Cheese, which I then had to take back and get exchanged for Ranch.  Not a huge problem, but just a little annoying.  The Ranch was very good however.\n\nThe \""Olive Oil Cake\"" that everyone RAVES about?  Meh.  It's just an extra-moist version of your average pound cake.  Tastes just like the pound cake I grew up eating in Texas, but it was a little \""oilier\"" than your usual pound cake fare.  It was good, but not \""Oh My God!\"" good.\n\nNow for the best item I had from there:  The Drool Creator.\n\nIt was mostly an afterthought, really.  While standing in line to get the Olive Oil cake to go, I saw the little section where they keep their \""to go\"" salads.  I looked around at the varieties, and thought the Chopped Turkey Salad looked promising - bacon, boiled egg, turkey slices, cheese, lettuce, tomatoes, and two different dressings - Blue Cheese and some sort of yellowish vinaigrette.   I decided to take one home and eat it for lunch at work on Monday and Tuesday.\n\nGreat.  Decision.\n\nI don't really know what the magic was.  Maybe it was just a good combination of flavors.  Maybe it was just all fresh.  Maybe they use some sort of Magical Salad Crack.  I don't know.  But it was a DANG good salad.  Even on the third day, when I ate the last of it.\n\nI just combined both dressings ( about half of each little container each day ) and it was marvelous.\n\nNot too many meals cause me to drool in between bites.  This salad had some serious Mojo.\n\nI WILL be back for another one, hoping to recapture the Magic."
1,"Since I heard this place was going to open, I've been wanting to go.  It's a museum about the mob.  And it's in the courtroom where the Kefauver trial actually happened years ago in Vegas.  What more do you need.\n\nNow I know, for what it is, it might seem a bit pricey, but if this stuff interests you, it'll be worth the money and your time.\n\nTheir website recommends giving yourself at least 3 hours of time to go through everything.  Make the time. Give yourself extra time. Don't try to squeeze this in with a bunch of other stuff.  You'd be surprised how time flies.\n\nThere are plenty of exhibits and video.  Interviews and pictures.  There are tons of artifacts for you to look through.  There is also a gun shooting simulation room which is kinda fun if you've never shot a gun before."
1,"OK I have a confession to make....I'm not Jewish! But that does not stop me from loving the JCC!\n\nSo I was introduced to the JCC by a Jewish friend of mine who is a member there. Once she asked me if I wanted to come work out with her there, and I figured why not it looks really nice from the outside! It is an awesome facility as far as gyms go in the area. Very new, top of the line equipment..including Pilate's machines, awesome locker rooms with saunas and Jacuzzis, tons of class rooms, cafe, and much more. I'm not sure how much it is to be a member there..and there is the fact that I'm not Jewish,  but hey this gym is top of the line!"
0,"Stay away!!!\n\nThey took my credit card and loosed it, they requiring to have it taken when you order more then one drink, later i found out someone actually used it, i won't be surprise if its one of their employees, just worst shady bad experience i have ever had!\n\nYou got that?? they taking your credit card, it required for getting drinks to you, but they have it somewhere unsecured. \n\nWhen I asked to get it back they didn't find it.\n\nWhen I started to get upset was worst experience ever, just shady answers, made me feel like I did something wrong ***they*** loosed my credit card.\n\nthey don't care about their customers at all, we asked to speak to a supervisor, when he finally showed up he was so rude we regret we even bother.\n\nThe biggest problem was they didn't let us go anywhere because we had open check of over $2000, but I wasn't able to pay it because they didn't find my card!!\n\nmy friends had to figure the check out.\n\nLater I found someone charged my card, I bet one of their employees, so I had to contact the credit card company and deal with all this mess after Vegas trip.\n\nThey don't belong to Aria Resort, when we complained about them to the Aria we been told they are independently owned.\n\n\nWe spent there over $2000, it was 6 of us.\n\naccept that we had good time before all that happened, but its not worth it, go somewhere who appreciate your business, somewhere who will not try to steal your money .\n\nThey just don't deserves anyone's business, i will never go back!"
1,"It's a huge property with an equally huge parking garage (try to rememer where you parked or you could get lost). Also, you're not allowed to stay in your car if you're in the parking lot- lots of security guards on bikes surveying the parking lot levels. I remember when the lion's mouth was the entrance into the casino, but the asian high rollers/gamblers believed it was \""bad luck.\"" That was changed- quickly. Home of the free attraction Lion Habitat (it's free, go see it) and the only Rainforest Cafe in LV (bit of a walk getting there), some good reasons to visit. Also remember years ago, 'The Wizard of Oz\"" display- it's been quite a while, but that was so neat. Bu thought I should mention it. Seen good reviews of the pool, which has a lazy river. Considering a staycation here (never done it) since there are good rates available for locals on www.stayandplayhere.com."
1,Hits the spot all the time!!! My husband and I can always count on this place  the service is just okay! But the food makes up for the slow and unfriendly service.
0,"Worst coffee ever. I'm not kidding! It was horrible, ugh. \nOnly go if you have a coupon."
0,"This place gets 1 star for the food and 3 stars for the desserts.\n\nI would have thought that the creators of this buffet would take a lesson from places like Bellagio and Wynn, but they obviously were sleeping during class.  The crab legs were sooooo salty and gummy.  The fish dishes were overcooked.  The indian curries were bland.  I did like the prime rib, but don't forget to put the au jus!\n\nThe upside is that I think they spent all the time and effort on the dessert section.  The dessert offerings were plated individually and they were beautiful!  They also tasted good.  My favorites were the Nutella cake and the caramel flan.  Ice cream, cookies, biscotti, and brownies were also offered.\n\nOur server was very attentive and nice.  I cannot say the same for the people manning the different food areas.  No one could tell me what veggie was in the chicken curry (I figured out it was spinach).  \n\nWe went for lunch, and it was $20 per person.  I wouldn't come back here unless they revamped their offerings."
1,"Hands down my favorite place to golf in AZ. Makes a lot of sense that it was rated 87 of the top 100 courses you can play by golf magazine and is ranked number 5 in arizona. Can play challenging from the tips but can scale it down from the multiple tee boxes available. Practice facility is top notch with putting, chipping, and pitching greens with sand to practice in. Has plenty of room to practice your 40 yard pitches without killing anyone or being yelled at. Pracitce in the sand because you will likely hit one of the 119 bunkers on the course! Staff is great and my starter Steve had PLENTY of knowledge about the course. Food was fantastic as well especially for the price. Paid 7 for a drink, sandwich, and chips. The sandwich was large and sustaining. Overall the course reminds me of where they played the pga championship in south carolina visually. Probably my favorite was not risking hitting a house and the silence that is never there when playing at most courses in Arizona. Conditions were great for the time of the season a month before overseeding begins. Some bunkers were underconstruction but were playable. Price wise I found a great deal online but would be willing to pay premium prices for winter conditions to see what this place has to offer when it is at its best! When you get out there take it all in!"
0,Had the Caribbean coconut tofu...totally bland and unseasoned! I was really hoping for great vegetarian food and will probably not be back!
0,"Not very good. 25 min wait for what should be somewhat fast food. The flavors were not very good on any of the 4 items we had. I'd suggest they reevaluate the menu and then figure out how to be more efficient. People will forgive slow service for good food, but this place is a bust on all fronts."
0,"LOL at the thought of customer service coming from this location!!\n\nOne of the main reasons I will come to papa johns is because of the garlic dipping sauce, well now they can keep that because I will not be coming back to this place.\nLet me explain my experience.. I always voluntarily give out my email address because I love getting great deals/offers.\nI attempted twice (cell phone & desktop) to place an order using a promo code, it would not go through. I called the store and explained my issue, and asked if I could hold, then was hung up on. I called again a woman picked up, explained again, before I could finish she said there was nothing she could to do to honor the online coupon then stated its not her fault my computer or phone wasn't working (try your website) \nI asked for a manger, and was hung up on... \n\nReally your pizza isn't  worth it!"
1,Place is so cool...Small but very hip..clean and staff is so friendly. I had the Giai juice and was so pleased. DK pasta is great and fresh. If you are looking for something fresh and different this is the spot.
1,"Sonntagmittag war ich mit meiner\nFreundin im Bambus Garten. Die Bedienung die uns entgegenkam konnte\nich nicht als solche erkennen, da er ein Fu\u00dfballtrikot der\nItalienischen Nationalmannschaft trug. Er bot uns die freien Tische\nzur Wahl an. Wir nahmen den am Fenster gleich neben dem Eingang. Die Karte bietet Thai und China K\u00fcche\nan. Man braucht ein wenig Zeit um sie durchzubl\u00e4ttern, da sie ein\nwenig un\u00fcbersichtlich ist. In meiner Karte fehlte z.B. eine Karte\nmit Spezialit\u00e4ten die aber in der Speisekarte meiner Freundin\nvorhanden war. Auf der Speisekarte wird darauf hingewiesen das mit\nGlutamat gekocht wird. Ich entschied mich f\u00fcr das Rindfleisch\nSzechuan, meine Freundin bestellte die geb. Ente mit Gem\u00fcse. Als\nextra bestellte ich noch gebratenen Reis als Beilage. Unser Essen kam recht bald und es sah\nnicht nur sehr gut aus, es schmeckte auch wirklich gut. Die gebackene Ente war knusprig und\nsaftig. Das Szechuan war lecker und schmeckte auch meiner Freundin\ndie das Gericht zum ersten mal probierte. Bei gebratenem Reis als Beilage konnte\nman auch nichts falsch machen. Preislich waren die Gerichte absolut in\nOrdnung. Der Service war freundlich und nett, aber nicht wirklich\nangemessen gekleidet. Vielleicht sollten man das Glutamat aus\ndem Speisen lassen, das steigert nur den Durst des Gastes was gut f\u00fcr\nden Betreiber ist, aber das Essen nicht besser macht."
1,"I just had these today and omigosh! They were sooooo good! I had a chocolate twist, which was huge, I had to share it with my co-worker. I also had a jelly donut and 10 donut holes (I got for another co-worker) and I only spent $3.50! That's such a good deal. I can't even tell they're vegan! Such a great selection."
0,"Don't get me wrong.  This place is definitely better than Palace Station, but I've had better hotels in Vegas than Palms Place with less money spent.  \n\nWhere do I start?\n\n1.  Balcony was locked for security reason - I wish I had read the Yelp reviews before I book this hotel.  Why do they bother to have the balconies if the balconies are not meant to be accessible.  Just so they can charge a premium on the rooms?\n2.  The kitchen in the room has a stove top, a sink, a dish washier, but no cook wares, no dinner wares, no utensils...  Again, they don't expect you to use the kitchen.  It's just there so they can charge a premium.\n3.  Virtually non-existent Wifi \n4.  Poor lighting in the room and the light fixtures are cheap and flimsy.\n5.  Bathroom is poorly maintained - We had a large jetted tub with marble tiles, but it looks like crap.  There is very poor bond between the grout and the tile's edges.  The shower drain looks disgusting.  Don't expect double sink in the luxury suite, because it's not there.\n6.  We have a TV in the bedroom and one in the \""sitting area\"", but the TV at the \""sitting area\"" is not even hook up.....  Really?\n7.  Palms Place has its own pool on the 6th floor of the tower, away from the Palms, but Palms Place's pool is basically a kiddie pool - a small, shallow pool with a ton of kids.  The entire pool area is small and it's closed off, so it's almost closterfobic.  We went to the pool at the Palms, instead.\n\nI am not complaining about walking from Palms Place to Palms, because I am trying to be more active and healthy.  I almost did 1,000 steps from walking to the pool at Palms and back to our room."
1,"My friends and I wanted to eat at an AYCE sushi place.  There were some debates on which place to go.  My friend that lives in LV recommended me to go here.  He lived here 10+ years and also has a sushi chef background.  With that in mind and the 600+ reviews in yelp, we decided to go here.  There was a 15 minute wait, which we didn't mind because we walked to the mini mart a few stores down and bought a bottle of beer.  We requested sitting at the bar so that we can order directly from the sushi chefs.  The sushi was fresh and made quick.  There were also items that needed to be ordered from the waiter - yakitori, pork belly, udon, dessert, shumai, etc.  Everything I ordered was delicious.  There were also daily specials too.  After we were finished I asked my friends if this was better than the other place you went last time (Don't want to call out the other place).  He said this place was better."
1,"This plane has to do I rinks.  There could be free skating on one wild berry and ice hockey on the other. With the hockey rink being divided into three smaller rinks horrible kids teens to play and practice. If I lived in the Phoenix area, and had a child that was interested in playing hockey, or I was interested in playing hockey myself, this place would be fantastic."
1,"All of the staff were very friendly and feel is somewhat hipster without all the hipsters, it's great! The ordering method via a tablet on every table is very neat and worked flawlessly. The owner was walking to every table to check on the quality and satisfaction, showing he really cares about what he is serving. The food and juices were very fresh tasting and well worth the price."
1,"Family and I went today for the first time. Knew it would be great as we are big fans of Chef Marc's Parma. Service was great, staff greeted us warmly and asked if it was our first time and explained process. Chef Marc was there and called us over to sample a new dish he was working on, \""avolto\"", which is INCREDIBLE! We ordered a cheese pizza for our 19 month old, wife had a gluten free Chef Marc and I had the Calbrese. Everything was PERFECT. Ingredients and flavors were exceptional. Had a little gelato after to top it off which was the perfect finish to a wonderful lunch! Will be going back this week!"
1,Perfect place for a nice friendly breakfast either on a date or with family. The staff are all smiles and enjoy the environment of this little cafe as well. The food is creative and delicious!
0,"The food here is stale. The lighting makes it very unappetizing. The \""waiters?\"" are very rude. The tables are way to close to the horrible buffet. The floor is filthy. Everything here is squeezed in. There's no room. This is one of the worst places I've been."
1,"Now, there are only a few late night eateries I can go to. AYCE sushi, Roberto's, and of course bars. But when I stumbled upon this gem. Who doesn't want ramen at 2am? This place is great! First off, I adore the atmosphere. It's very mellow and dark (as a ramen bar should.) \n     I've had my server Alex, 3 times and each time she was remarkably nice and very attentive. From what I can tell, so is the rest of the staff.\n     As for the food, in my opinion, Jinya does ramen right. The pork broth I had was flavorful and slightly thick. Noodles were on point. The Cha Sui pork slices melted in mouth and nothing is better than their seasoned egg. The appetizers we ordered, which consisted of Spicy tuna of crispy rice, crispy chicken, and pork Gyoza, were also all delicious! \n      If you're looking for genuine ramen, even if it's late night. Then Jinya is the place you need to go."
1,"Things have changed at Lawless Denim!!!\n\n   It might of taken almost a year, but Lawless Denim has totally redeemed themselves!! After cleaning house and getting rid of the bad apples they had working for them, they are now newly staffed with amazing employees and I want to be able to share with everyone that they made things right with me !!! In my book that goes a LONG WAY!!! I have recently been dealing with a new manager at Lawless named Jim Fuentes, and this guys knows how to take care of his customers.. He called me up and explained to me that they wanted to make things right..   And that he did!!! \n\nI am totally stoked that I will be receiving my new denim jeans, on time and the jeans are amazing. I always knew they had an amazing product and I am truly happy that Jim and the rest of the crew at Lawless reached out to me.. The customer service I have received has been outstanding and a big kudos to Jim and the rest of the crew at Lawless Denim...  \n\nI will be making some major purchase ASAP.. Now they have customer service that matches their amazing products... Sky is the limit for this company!!\n\nThanks again!!"
0,"I've heard this restaurant from listening to NPR in Charlotte, so I went and invited some of my friends and decided to come here to check it out. Here are my reviews.\n\nVenue - the ambiance inside the restaurant is like being in Japan. If you have a large group of people, your group will be sitting as if you're sitting on a floor, but your not. The sits are elevated and the center piece is wide open. It's a comfortable sitting arrangement.\n\nSushi - the Unagi (Eel) was cooked perfectly. The softcrab shells are not bad, but I had better ones before.  The rice was cooked very well not to sticky or clumpy. They need better selections in sushi.\n\nPresentation - the restaurant lacks in presentation.  It was a very simple dish put together.  \n\nSake - they are pricey. $15.00 minimum. \n\nRamen - the soup was very tasty.  \n\nOverall,  if you are craving for ramen, this is the best place so far I've tasted. As for sushi, I would only come here once. I've had much better sushi with awesome presentation and much better selections in California before.  I still have yet to find a sushi that will replace my experienced in California. Also, if you don't tip enough. You will be called back in by the waitress asking you to add more on the tip. Its a MANDATORY!!!  It feels like a teacher is about to scold you."
1,"They happen to have the best burgers in town!  My husband & I love the special \""Blackened Salmon\"" and the Black & Blue salad is addicting-nice, clean local pub to eat & feel comfortable.  Servers are very nice-sometimes you have to be patient until the food comes out but its worth the wait!"
1,"Food was way to expensive for us to order. Sat at the bar and had the happy hour drinks.  That was a great price!  The bartenders were very good, happy , and friendly.  Good place as far as I am concerned to get your drink started!"
0,"I actually never was able to try the food here. I got so pissed at the girl taking my order that I left. What happened? Well listen to this...I decided on a sandwich..I am not sure of the name , but it had roast beef and some sort of yummy cheese and the other sandwich stuff they add to it. Well I am not a fan of veggies, i know, that's so childish, but it is what it is. Anyway, I tell the girl what I want and I let her know I want the roast beef sandwich with only cheese and mayo, no veggies. She then looks very puzzled...\"" you just want cheese and mayo on bread\""? I said no....I want the roast beef with just cheese and mayo. She then says that it does not make any sense....\""so you don't want the meat\""? I then ask her...why would I order \""roast beef\"" and then not want the meat? She is like well I dont know you are the one that ordered it that way. Im like are you serious right now???? She then says ...well if you are not gonna order can you step aside so I can take the next order. What ????!!!!! I ask to speak to the manager...who apparently is the girl that has been standing next to her the whole time and did not seem to think there was a problem at all. \n\nI was so outta there...I am sure the food is yummy..but it is such a shame to not only have an employee that responds this way...but to have a person in charge thinking it was normal."
1,"I never have any complaints about the location on Montford in Charlotte! From the person that takes the order, the time it takes to prepare, to delivery or pick up, they are always friendly and the price is right. I try different pizzas, but always get an antipasto with it. Pizza always has plenty of toppings and so do the salads."
1,"She did great! Came out to Vegas for vacation and she helped watch my daughter at the hotel. Very nice lady, thank you Anahi!"
0,Never again! Car towed after a 45 minute wait!!! The food is very good. Great menu mix...its just that you really need to devote an hour and a half of your life to enjoy it. Not very conducive in a fast paced place like ASU/ Tempe.
1,"While my husband and I were visiting the area we tried and really enjoyed this place! It was a fun and lively bar/grill.  we were there on 1/13/12 and shared the nachos w/ ground beef (big enough to share), then my husband had the shrimp fajitas and I had the chicken fajitas. The food was really fresh and the portions were very generous. Our waiter (didn't get his name) was awesome, just the right amount of attention. The night we were there the age group of the clientele seemed to range from early thirties up. If you're looking for intimate this is not the place for you. But if you're looking for a fun place to laugh your head off with friends then I highly recommend it!"
0,"I've been to Tiffany's many times before. It is local, convenient, and they have a large menu with pretty good food. \n\nI was there this morning and we were a group of 8 who haven't seen each other in quite some time. After just a bit over an hour, we were asked to stop our conversations and leave the table as they needed it for other guests. Never before have I ever been asked to get up and leave even if we already finished eating. \n\nSo - if you want a very quick meal, this is the place to go, if you are looking to enjoy yourself, then I would choose somewhere else."
0,This place was the only thing that was open in the area at 11pm. I was starving and I figured I'd give this place a try. This was a HUGE mistake! I ordered a shrimp and steak quesadilla to go. By the time I got home the quesadilla was not only swimming in fatty oil but it was drowning in it! I was disgusted at the pool of grease that laid atop my food! I tried to save it by blotting it with napkins but it was no use. I was NOT going to put that in my body. It was just not worth it.
1,"Love it! The shrimp burritos are the best I've ever had. Also, the chicken tortilla soup is to die for. Pentiful baskets of thin/crispy chips and good but, not to hot, salsa are on your table immediately. (you can ask for hotter if you need to)\n\nOutdoor tables-however are in a parking lot area.\n\nHeard the atmosphere is better at the other Salsa's location on Carmel Road but, haven't made it there yet."
1,This salon is great and the stylist there are so friendly.  I go here regularly for my pedicures.  You'll never go back to the chop shop type pedicures once your feet have felt the hands of Ivon.  My husband gets his haircut here as well and he loves it.  Great location for us too.
0,"If I could give minus stars I would. The service there is the ABSOLUTE WORST!!!!!!\n\nNow I am in the middle of packing to move to Portland but I am taking the time out to write this review because this is how bad this place is. I have been to Mrs. Whites on several occasions and the service has always been pretty crappy but today took the cake. \n\nBreakdown of events:\n\n1.Call in my order at 5:30pm. The woman that answered the phone had no business telephone etiquette at all. \n\n2. Arrive at Mrs. Whites after going through the maze of the light rail and one way traffic...I digress that is not their fault. Anyway I walk in and I am cheerfully greeted by a young lady that is sweeping. A woman (I am sure the one that answered when I called is on the phone). She is on the phone with her boyfriend calling him out for cheating on her. Using all sorts of profanity while doing so. \n\n3. I state that I am there for the to go order and that is it. No one says it will be a few more mins or anything. Now mind you I live on 10th St & Camelback so travel time to Mrs. Whites should have been sufficient time to prepare...fried fish, mac and cheese and mixed greens. 2 of the 3 dishes are cooked already I am sure. \n\n4. I wait for about 10 mins when a older gentleman that works there reminds the phone lady that I am waiting for my order. I assume she is the cook. Well phone lady never even started my order. She did not start my order until 10 mins after I walked in the door and she was done calling out her boyfriend on the phone.\n\n5. In my 30 mins of sitting and waiting. There were 5 employees there and the owner was one of them. He did not acknowledge me or anything and sat across from me watching tv and then left. Why does it take close to and hour to make my order with that many people there in the kitchen?\n\n6. My food finally arrives, only to be dropped down in front of me...no words...just nothing. So I leave my  $10.18 for my meal as it states on the website since nobody came to take my money. Bad enough I have to wait for my food but I be da@#$ed if I will wait for you to come take my money. So I left. \n\n7. I barely get my foot in the car and phone lady is out the back door saying that I did not pay the total for my meal. I said that the website said the meals were $10.18. She tells me that the price on the site is wrong the meals are now $14+. So I give the extra $4. Now why could she have not been that quick with making my food?\n\nSo save yourself the time and headache of this place. It is not worth it. I don't care how many celebrities or what Food Network show they were on. I have been to plenty of famous soul food places in Harlem NYC and never would anything like this ever happen.  \n\nIf you have a jones for some soul food check out Lo Lo's in Scottsdale. The food is basically the same and the service is excellent."
0,"I heard they're organizing the official Cockfest 2015 here. No seriously, where are all the chicks? How am I walking through a GIANT crowd of ONLY dudes? Also, what the fuck kind of a club decides to book several parties to a single table? No joke, complete strangers had their bottles on our table (though they were probably thinking the same about us), and the workers were shoving tabs in peoples' faces left and right. Seriously? I get that you want more people to go for bottle service, but you can't quadruple-book a table, amigos. \n\nIt would be fine if the music was okay, but the DJ was apparently a cocaine addict suffering from ADHD, because the songs were changing literally every 20 seconds or so. What about all the sweet moves I learned on YouTube, bro!?"
1,"Very fun and chill atmosphere, not too loud or crowded on a Tuesday night (of course). Unfortunately it had been raining a lot and there was no terrace setup, but I would like to go back and check it out next time. The bartender was a tad snobby (he only spoke French and when I tried to speak slowly in English my local friend just ended up telling him in French what I was saying), but that wasn't a big deal. He seemed skeptical that I would like the apparently strong IPA I had ordered, but I like IPAs and it's not his business really! :]\n\nAside from that, I had a great time sitting at the bar and chatting with a friend. I'd go back if I'm in Montreal again someday."
1,"Seriously, every woman in Madison should go here.  The staff is sweet and you can find pretty much anything you're looking for.  I always feel very safe when I go here, which is a big plus."
1,"I am a self confessed coffee snob, and I'd much rather drink a great tea, than suffer through a bad coffee, so, in an area devoid of good places to drink coffee, why not drink tea?\n\n\n The staff here are very friendly and definitely know their stuff. They blend their own teas and brew it just the way it is meant to be brewed. Some may even think it is a bit obsessive the way they weigh the leaves and time the brewing process, but if you want the perfect tea, its how it should be. They have everything on the menu from a Scottish Breakfast (tea that is) to Rooibos, Oolong, and my personal favourite the green Qing Ta -- or something along those lines. To be honest I can never remember the name, but the staff know its my favourite, so I don't need to know!\n\n\n There are plenty of tables and comfy couches to curl up into while you enjoy your cuppa, maybe while checking your email with the free wifi. The walls are decorated with some striking photos, and if you like what you see and your wallet allows, you can take them home. I haven't tasted the coffee, so for once I can't pass comment on that, and while the food cabinet looks well stocked, I haven't had any of that either....\n\n\n Tea Tree Tea is easily missed as its located off Lothian Road 10 or so metres down Bread Street... but next time you crave caffeine, why not try some tea?!"
0,They are very slow in the drive thru.
0,This place just refused service. I have come here many times before! This time I had a hang nail that had bled but I informed them that it had not bled for 24 hours and that I have been keeping it properly cleaned for sanitation sake. They refused to fix the nail claiming that it was still bleeding. I told them that it had not been for a day but they argued with me saying that it would burn. I told them I have experiences far worse and that pain was not an issue. They made me wait 20 minutes and then refused service. I will NOT be coming back!!
0,"Four of us had the buffet last Saturday night. Total price 187.00. This turned into a grossly nightmare. For the next three days three of us experienced gastric pain, vomiting, etc. awful, awful experience. I called the front desk who transferred me to the buffett manager, who passed it off to security for an investigation. Obviously nothing will be done. Please beware of the seafood buffett. This ruined our whole trip. We didnt dare leave our room."
1,"Stopped in here today with Robyn N. for the Lunch Buffet.  Things have slipped just slightly from the best it has been here, as the Mongolian BBQ which used to have 8 meats (!) is not down to five, & the total food item count is down to 140 from it's peak of 150, not counting sauces & dressings.  ALSO, some of the other Chinese Buffets around the Valley such as certain locations of Hibachi & China City are just so good that the competition is really getting tough for this long-established place.\n\nWith that said, Crazy Buffet here slips down to 4 Stars for right now, but I'm certainly still a fan of this friendly, comfortable place that serves up delicious food at a reasonable price, and still including TEN kinds of ice cream!     :-))\n\nWeekday Lunch Buffet $7.99/$7.19 Sr."
1,"Most cheap, fast-food burgers are glorified slop. \nMost sit-down \""fancy\"" burgers are terribly over-priced. \nWouldn't it be great to get a GREAT burger AND a GREAT price!?\n\nHabit.\n\nThis place never disappoints. The burgers are fresh, flavorful and made to order in an open kitchen.. The fries are cooked to a perfect crisp. The interior of the restaurant is neat, clean and welcoming. The staff is friendly. There are even menu items that cater to the non-carnivores out there.\n\nAll-in-all, it's great burger, a very reasonable price, and a super way to spend your lunch hour."
1,"Feeling the need to sample more than one donut shop while in Vegas I went to Coco Donuts after  getting a dozen at Pinkbox.\nEvening it out with \""only\"" a half dozen here, the selection while not as vast, still delicious. \nCustard filled cronut, clearly the star of the show here,  perfect in every way, from the crunch, to the custard to the glaze, amazing!\nApple cinnamon, blueberry glazed, creme filled, crumb cake and a fabulous buttermilk bar also did not dissapoint!\nThe owner is super nice and threw in some donut holes, cute, clean shop, worth a stop, it is about 15 minutes east of the strip.\nSeems like Vegas has some outstanding donut options, more trips planned soon!"
1,"Saw the high Yelp reviews for this place, and we were staying in the adjoining Main Street Station, so we ended up in here for dinner one night.  We got there around 7, and there was a line of maybe a dozen folks ahead of us.\n\nI had the saimin (good, but nothing special), as well as the garlic chicken.  GF got the combo plate that had Korean beef and chicken, along with the obligatory rice and macaroni salad.  This isn't fine dining by any stretch - presentation isn't really a concern, and we're not talking about any crazy complimentary flavors or subtle undertones or anything.  Portions are large - GF and I could easily have just split the combo plate and been more than full.  Solid, stick-to-your-ribs, Hawaiian style food.  The beef and chicken were solid, maybe a bit fatty, but that's to be expected.\n\nCash only was a bit of a surprise, but fortunately I hadn't handed over all my money on the blackjack tables.\n\nThis is one of those places that looks like a hole in the wall, but looks like it's always packed.  Large portions and great bang for the buck.  Not amazing food, but a great value, especially if you're craving Hawaiian style."
1,"The Wynn Buffet gets 5 stars!  Yes, there is a wait - about 30-35 minutes.  But there is always going to be a wait if it's good.  Yes, it's $39.95 a pop - but it includes endless champagne and it's all you can eat!  The prime rib was delicious, and so were the crab legs.  If you're not impressed by either, then I suggest not coming here.  \n\nThere is also a variety of items on the menu such as several kind of seafood ceviches, pastas, some sushi, some dim sum, various soups...\n\nIt was a girl's weekend in Vegas, and we took full advantage of the buffet, staying for a whopping four (4!) hours, between 1 and 5 pm on a Saturday.  One server change, bottle after bottle of champagne (sparkling wine, if you want to get technical) mimosas, and one entire meal change later (from brunch until dinner) satisfied our food needs for the entire day.  The dessert selection is huge, and should not be missed."
0,"Experience in ER started out great until I was placed in the care of ER 'nurse' Kelly.  At the ER, I would usually expect to be treated with some modicum of compassion and 'dignity' as the name of the parent company implies. Nurse Kelly began her brand of compassion by digging around in my arm to insert an IV catheter. I begged her no less than 6 times to stop, please try the other arm. I was in extreme pain.\nNurse Rachet responded by digging further in scolding me it was a large catheter. After she could mangle my arm no further, she tried my other arm and got it right in.\n\nAfter waiting in the room for an MRI for 4 hours, I was starving. I asked for something to eat and was told I could not eat before the MRI, which I understand. Nurse Kelly then began a lecturing tirade at me in the middle of the ER that I 'needed to understand that when I come to the ER that I should expect to be there all day, including at least three hours after the test to wait for results. She further went on to suggest that I was being selfish and not considerate of other patients whose needs may be greater than mine. I was SIMPLY asking only if she might know when I may be taken in for the test. Her accusations were a needless and reactionary assault on my character. I would never want to push my way in front of a patient who has more pressing needs!\nI\nAt that point, I told her I needed another nurse. I refuse to be treated as a child by a condescending, incompetent nurse whose calling is supposedly to be a compassionate care giver. I do not go to the ER everyday and I was afraid enough for my health already, which is clearly WHY I was there in the first place. She then continued her condescending lecture on how she has tons of other patients; blah blah blah and said she would speak to her supervisor about getting me another nurse.\n\nMollified again, I said I wanted to check out. Whatever was wrong with me was no longer worth tolerating this treatment I am PAYING for. I will be following up elswhere hopefully at a healthcare center that does not employ 'caregivers' of such ineptitude that treat you like trash. For the record, I have insurance and am not indigent, not that that should matter. Having entered the world at St. Joe's 40 years ago, it was particularly disheartening.  \n\nIf you go to the ER there and your nurse happens to be Kelly, I would suggest getting back in you car and going ANYWHERE else!!!!"
0,It's not a bad place if you hate money and like leaving restaurants still hungry. I never need to bother eating here again.

1,"This place has good food!! I have been going here for years and I love that it is open late and located in a good area. I love their fried porkchops, special fried rice, porkchop combo, and of course their pho!! My favorite is their eggrolls! Theyre busy all day but especially late at night."
1,"If you're a fan of Thrifty ice cream, you can find it inside this Chevron gas station's market at the corner of Jones and Warm Springs.  We were originally headed for the Asian ice cream place next door, but somehow we ended up here instead to check out the selection and stayed.  Nostalgia!  I haven't had Thrifty ice cream in ages, so it was nice to see the old standards like mint n chip, chocolate malted crunch, circus animal cookie, black cherry, butter pecan, etc.  This is indeed a full-service ice cream counter right past the cashier.  Girlfriend had a scoop of birthday cake and I had pecan praline on a cone.  There are even two tables inside so you can enjoy your treats before you leave.  Free tastes and friendly service inside the Chevron? Now you know like I do!"
0,"We stayed at the Golden Nugget so decided to give this place a try for breakfast. The food was terrible and overpriced, reminded me of buffer food. Claim Jumper typically has huge portions with delicious food but not at this location, at least not for breakfast.  Avoid this place and head over to the Plaza Hotel and eat breakfast at Hash House a Go Go instead."

1,"Used to be my go-to chinese place when I lived in AJ and I visited there last night after being gone 3 years and glad to say the food is still great. Love their honey walnut chicken (but I did notice the sauce was a bit different, not quite as sweet as it was but still good.) Service is always good, but when the blue hairs come in during the fall it gets very busy so expect service to be slow. Great value and yummy food! =)"
0,"Pretty much blows since they changed from a New York pizza joint to an Applebee's wannabe. Service downhill, food is eh, we're done going here."
1,This is the best place for Taiwanese food and snacks in Tempe. The service is great and the food is also phenomenal. There isn't a single thing on the menu that I've tried that has been bad. I can't stop coming back for more!
0,"If I could rate this negative stars, I would. I have been taking my nephews here since they opened. Our experiences have been great until today!  \n1st...we weren't 2 steps in to store before the clerk listed half a dozen things my boys could not do. Dont touch the jerky barrel, don't touch the samples, don't touch the refrigerator section.  Now mind you, they bring their own money and are 12 & 15. They are not hyper and they are very respectful.  \n2nd....our total was $80 and change. I give her $44 and want the balance on a card. She takes the cash, then takes a personal phone call while she is running card. She hands me a slip to aign for the total purchase amount.  She tells me that's just the total, not what I charged your card.  I check the account on my phone and show her she charged me more than $36. She argued with me then told me she could not give me the $44 in cash back. Said there are not refunds.   She proceeds to call her manager and continues to tell him the wrong thing.  \nFinally afer 15 minutes she gives me my $44. \n3rd...she refused to let me apeak to her manager, put her hand in my face and was beyond rude. \n\nAs I said, I used to love this place. Whether it be new staff or bad management,  I don't know, but I will never return. \nOne more thing, apparently if you are under 18, they do not want your business.  Ahe took a call while we were there and told someone that kids under 18 were not allowes. The reason....get this, they sale hot sauce and have nuts out for samples. Are ypu f**king kidding me! Well walmart sales hot sauce and has nut samples too. So I guess they think that those under 18 are too stupid to realize hot sauce is hot and if you're allergic to nut you should not sample.\nChange your staff and rules!"

1,SO.\nDAMN.\nHIP!\n\nlots of eating disorders wearing stuff from anthropolgie taking themselves too seriously. I enjoy people watching here. Best place to watch public break ups.\n\nmaybe if we all hold our breathe and promise not to move away phoenix will become a real city....
1,"This Goodwill is my 2nd favorite in the Charlotte area for overall deals and selection.  In my humble opinion, this store seems to be the largest Goodwill in Charlotte, unless you count that ramshackle Goodwill store on Freedom Dr. *shudder*\n\nFew people would drive to Albemarle Rd. to visit a thrift shop because its, well East Charlotte.  But after shopping at other Goodwills, I've been pleasantly surprised with the selection of appliances, furniture, books, and clothes.  They have a good selection of furniture and its normally salvageable and microwaves for $10-$15.  The book section is actually larger that most thrifts stores.  You'll find alot of fluff (read:Danielle Steel, James Patterson), but you can find some real treasures as well.  They seem to get alot of overstock books at this location.  \n\nThe men's clothes are decent.  I've found nice sports coats and shirts that are slightly worn, but not necessarily threadbare.  The clothing is not as good as the Matthews Plantation Goodwill, but don't dismiss the clothing completely.  Customer service is predictably unpredictable, but oh well.  If you're looking to furnish an apartment with little $$$, find a pelvic thrust exercise machine, or get some sensible threads, this Goodwill is a good bet."
1,"This place is great. I took my SUV to Professional Break Service and they could have sold me on unneeded service but they didn't. I drove from summerlin just because they had great yelp ratings. They are good at what they do, friendly and really helpful. We need more of these places in Vegas!"
0,"My husband and I had first time appointments with Tiffany Frasier, who is Dr Allen's PA-C or NP (not sure which), but I'm fine with that, and have had spectacular NP's/PA-C's in the past.  We were told on the phone to fill out paperwork that we could get online -- which we did -- and the address was on the paperwork -- which it was.  But, it was the wrong address.  We called them and drove to the correct address, went in, and were told that they don't accept handwritten paperwork.  So, still being 15-20 minutes early for our appointments, we did their Ipad stuff in lieu of paperwork.  We also had to initial several things, such as that they'll charge $50 if you're 7 minutes late and they have to reschedule you for another day, or that if you need a dr's signature for something it costs $20.  Right.  Okay, so, Tiffany was more than 7 minutes late (although I don't think she had to pay $50) and more like about 25 minutes late (which is okay, it's a dr's office and those things happen), and then it's my turn.  The assistant took me back and told me to get on the scale, which I didn't do, as I am a few short months from being 60 years old and am well aware of my height and weight.  She clearly was not happy about the fact that I didn't acquiesce, but she put me in a room to wait for Tiffany.  A few minutes later, a person whom I assumed to beTiffany stuck her head in the room and told me that I had to get on the scale or she wouldn't see me.  Mind you, she didn't introduce herself, didn't greet me in any way whatsoever, she simply demanded and threatened all at once.  Why didn't I get on the scale? Mainly because I have a problem with the cattle call aspect that a lot of medical clinics shove on people (I used to be a hospital chaplain, and I have some energy behind this attitude), but also because as a teen I used to have an eating disorder and it's still a bit uncomfortable to weigh in a strange environment, so a little kindness goes a long way with me.  As a result of these two things, before I start taking orders I like to know a little about what is going on, and if I trust the environment, the Dr -- PA -- NP, etc.  At any rate, I said, \""okay,\"" and got up and walked out, because at this stage in my life I don't intend to be powered, and I don't intend to be treated with disrespect.  The front office person was very nice about quickly refunding our co-pays, and also seemed genuinely unhappy about the way I was treated.  But, having a nice person at the front desk does not make up for the disrespectful treatment by the health care professional that I had the appointment with.  It's not fun writing negative reviews, and I see that this place has several already, but the bottom line is that if I am going to trust someone with my body, ergo, my life, then I expect to be treated in a compassionate and respectful manner in return.  I am sure that this facility is great for many people, but it isn't the one for us."
0,"Gary M on 6/1/2013 said it all.  Been going to this place for years.  The place gets dirtier and dirtier.  Less attention to detail.  The acoustics are awful.  It's very loud and you have to yell to be heard.  The food isn't prepared properly and all they do is raise their prices.  You like wings?  well..if you want something other than your typical mild, medium, hot, they charge you an extra dollar.  You want just paddles or drums?..yup, an extra $1.50.  You want a side of hot sauce?..yup..that's another $1.00.  When you leave, you've paid $1.50 for each WING...\n\nGo to Native New Yorker!!!  Get 'em YOUR way and they don't break the bank.\n\nOh, Robert Irvine needs to intervene here.  (Restaurant Impossible)"
0,"We choose this place over the many other pizza options in the area and boy that was a mistake....  I ordered a calzone to share and it was a large portion but the dough was raw and soggy! I asked if it at ricotta cheese and was told yes, and when I got it home I found out there was none. This was upsetting to me because I would have paid the extra for the ricotta had I just been told correctly.  I did order the garlic knots as well and they were okay, a little bland but not the worst I have had. All in all I will not return to this establishment not when  there is so many choices in the area."
0,I really hate that I couldn't have been able to come on here and just rave about our meal at Bob Evans but it would have been true. We had breakfast and the food was cold and the gravy and grits tasted like the chlorine water that they were made with. You could also taste it in the dry biscuits that we were served. The best thing about the whole experience was the hot coffee and the nice waitress that kept our cups filled and offered to-go cups. That was worth the two stars.
0,"This place SEEMED like a good idea at the time.\nMy mom needed an Emergency tooth removal, and this was the only closest place we could find that was open on a Saturday afternoon. We called scheduled an appointment and headed right in. My mom was Sitting in the waiting room in pain for almost an hour. Then when they finally took her back the doctor gave her a shot for the pain and started digging right in. The assistant suggested waiting at least 15 minutes so that the medicine can kick in but the doctor ignored her. the doctor literately Threw his tools on the tray and gave up when my mom cried out in pain. We left and were assed out of $75 for the horrible visit. \nAlso, they have a very fishy disclaimer form that my mom refused to sign."

0,They took forever to bring a waffle which should have came with the chicken the so called cooks were so busy bullshittin my waffle wasn't made until I went up to the counter and asked about it. One server worked and the other girl was completely use less.

Crazy part it wasnt busy.
1,"I am only giving 4 stars because the wait was very long for our food.  I live 2 blocks from this place and was always surprised it was still open, I never saw any cars in the parking lot.  My dad and I decided to go see if it was open, it was.  \n\nThe place is very open, and not to bright or loud.  That matters to me, I can't handle bright lights or loud noises.  \n\nThere was good selection of food.  We ordered soup and an appetizer.  The appetizer came within a reasonable time frame.  Both were very good.\n\nMy dad ordered something called the Clay Pot, it was not what he expected (looks wise) but it was very delicious.\n\nI got a burger, they were out of the normal patty so I got a chick patty on it instead.  The onion rings on it were perfectly fried, and were whole onion rings.  The fries it came with were shoestring and were hot and crispy.  \n\nThe wait was long, but honestly the food was worth it.  I would give the 5th star but it seems like from other reviews the wait time is a constant issue.\n\nI never thought this place was very busy, but while I was there about 10 people came in for to go orders.  \n\nI will be returning to this place, the food is wonderful."

0,"There's this terrible employee name Leslie Ybarra. After two visits for evaluation and a plan, I was ready to move forward. This Leslie said that she would email the 2 plans that I was interested in and follow up with a call. I got the email but didn't understand the abbreviations and scope of work and NO FOLLOW UP CALL. I left a couple of messages since I wasn't doing this for fun but I have dental issues that I want resolved. No call back other than a message next day saying that she was available until 2 pm. I called anyway (it was 4-4:30) and she was there. I asked her why she didn't call and she gave the worst possible answer any employee can give..I have too much work (going to 4 other offices and perhaps why those reviews stink as well) and don't have time to do what I said I would do, in essence. Also, even though she doesn't work in your mouth, she bites her nails which looked nasty and very unprofessional for a business where oral hygiene is critical. I suppose that she's too busy to scrub her nubs. Seeing these other reviews doesn't surprise me. I'm actually glad now that she didn't call, I may have really stepped in it."
1,"Service was great, our waiter was very informative and had excellent recommendations.  \n\nI ordered the pan-seared chicken penne pasta and it was so savory.  \n\nThe waiter recommended the bloody mary and it came out strong, rich and spicy.  I was impressed and nicely buzzed.    \n\nThe size of the portions are extreme, but the quality of the food is stellar all the way through."
0,"I had eaten at this joint previously when it was Long Wong's and the girl behind the counter copped to the dough being frozen and back then you could see the conveyor belt pizza oven. Nothing has changed except maybe the sauce and the addition of the so-called \""paper thin\"" style as well as the now available pizzas other than pepperoni.\n\nThe \""paper thin\"" pizza is \""paper thin\"" because it's a tortilla. When I looked at it initially I thought they had done a great job making an extraordinarilly thin pizza. Upon my first bite I thought to myself: cheesecrisp. After that I picked up the pizza to check the upskirt, as many pizza people call it, and knew for sure it was a tortilla.\n\nI'll give you the fact that their sauce is interesting but it's not good in fact far from it. Me and my wife came to the conclusion that it's some sort of canned stewed tomato type thing.\n\nOverall I'd say the two hippies have made a mockery of pizza and should have stayed in school. If this is a testament to the quality of their food then I won't be enjoying any of their other establishments."

1,"Three words: FISH FRY FRIDAY.\n\nHave you ever been to a backwoods bar in Wisconsin that has an all-you-can-eat fish fry on a Friday night for practically nothing?\n\nIf you answered \""no\"" to that question, then I invite you to experience the Peoria Cafe. It's the next best thing, right here in Arizona!  What you will get is reasonable prices, friendly service, and a good, old-fashioned Friday night fish fry.\n\nThe downside is that they only serve until 8 (?!?!) and I don't think they serve alcohol; everyone knows that a truly awesome fish fry is complimented by a brandy old-fashioned and/or a microbrew.  I would give a few points for their delicious home-made ranch dressing.\n\nMy advice: pre-drink and head over to the Peoria cafe for a great fried fish dinner!"
0,"I was excited to see a new little sushi spot in the area. The sushi was pretty good, and the drinks were good. (you can't go wrong with that) The service was horribly lacking. To think that at such a small restaurant and three servers can't handle a handful of tables, shows that management must be lacking as well. My servers name was Bebe, I think. She seemed like she was having a bad day, I could see it written all over her face. So that attitude portrayed through her service. I asked for two refills of my hot tea (the cups were pretty small) and she rolled her eyes and started gossiping to another server about it. Geez, did I do something wrong? I would think not!\nThe sushi chefs were friendly at the least, and the sushi wasn't the best i've had, but good.  i had the valentine roll, nothing too special but good. My favorite was the spider roll, and the yellowtail sashimi.. Those were pretty good as well. The prices are not too expensive and very competitive at least.\nI would give this place 3 stars but because of the lack or service, I gave it 2 stars. My favorite place till this day is Hiro sushi..."

1,"MMMMMMMMMMMMM....\nDo I really need to say more?! \nSeriously, this is the place to go if you are craving something usual with a twist.  \nFried pickles are great, and any of the burger options are very good.  I personally love the Ding Dong Burger... it simply gives an amazing asian flair to an already good burger.  \nAlso, if you are a corn-dog lover, then this is the place for you.  These aren't your standard, buy them frozen and in bulk, and we can can stick them in the deep fryer and hope they taste good, corn dogs.  These are GREAT corn dogs, with flavor in every bite, and blanketed in a great cornbread covering.  Yum!"
1,Best BBQ!!! Must go!!! They have all you can eat BBQ. And it's not crappy buffet style.  It's made to order every single time!!! Definitely great to come with friends and family!!  \nOrdered the beef rib and the meat is falling off the bone. Short ribs too. And their seafood is delicious.
0,"Open on time and have a dedicated line for your customers to call. Is that too much to ask. I go there 2 hours after the are supposed to be open and they are still closed. So I call the number listed and its some guys cell phone and he doesn't even answer with the name of the place. Just a \""yeah\"" Not dependable with questionable service so can't recommend it."
0,"we were disappointed from the restaurant having such high hopes seeing chef huber on tv and hearing much about him.\n\nwe had the 3 small items of the menu, each at $3 \nseasoned popcorn, fry chick peas and marinated olives.\nall 3 lacked much taste. honestly hubert - you should cut down on the portion in at least 66% and you can give all 3 items complimentary on each table. its like bread or the great french fries they give free at the steak house a cross the hall (stripsteak) and will just show some class!\n\nwe had the fish tacos which lacked seasoning and were very very very small (again much better tacos we had at border grill also few restaurants away belonging to very famous chefs). if this was suppose to be mexican - it lacks the salsa. if this was asian - maybe aoily sauce...anything to help the hard taco shell go down and taste of anything\n\nthe palenta was very tasty. the meat balls were tasty as well but not very memorable.\nthe sliders were very very good, juicy and tasty\n\nall in all, very small portions even for tapas style meal. most dishes were very ordinary.\nwe had much higher expectation from huber and unfortunatly they were not found.\nboth restaurants i mentions in this review are only few doors down from the location and were both much much better. so was rm seafood.\n\ni will for sure try one of these 3 famous chefs restaurants before if i had to start it all again...."
1,"Best of all is knowing I'm supporting a business with great owners. The fact they reach out to customers and care about our opinions is what keeps my family comming back. This place is perfect for babies and toddlers considering they won't get trampled on. I love that they have hands-on toys instead of only having large equipment. With that being said I understand how people feel it could be too many toys in a small space. I just recently saw the \""kid drop off\"" .. I'm curious how well it works. I would consider dropping my son off once he's 3-4 maybe."
1,"Oh dear nom of all things that are nom!\n\nGluten free? Yes please!\n\nAside from having a really good craft beer selection, they have an enormous whiskey selection too. Yes, even Bulleit and Buffalo Trace. \n\nI got the 1lb burger (no bun, I don't eat that no more) and had it cooked rare. This is so far the best rare burger I've had in recent memory! One pound of ground meat smothered in cheese and mushrooms. Hang on, I just drooled on my keyboard...\n\nAnd then the french fries! If I could drown them in the malt vinegar I would have been even more in heaven. (I can't eat the vinegar ya see? They do have it.) These are those crispy, thin, slightly thicker than shoe-string fries. \n\nI hear the pizza is pretty good too.\n\nThe only reason I can't give it a five star rating is the difficult eating space. I'd really suggest showing up early to have a drink or two and then take your burger to go. There's probably like 20 seats total (the majority at the bar) but I have no problem saying I'll go back if someone wants to join me!"
0,Worst Drive Thru Service Ever!!! Sat for over 10 min such a pain in the ass. Cashiers are rude and still managed to screw up the most basic of orders. I will never come back here
1,Breakfast guilty pleasure :)
1,Strange location...out of the way of Scottsdale's more touristy strip but it was worth the trip.  The Dr. Pepper shortribs and green chile mac and cheese were outstanding - couldn't keep my friends' paws off my plate!  The duck and fundito were good but I'll take my ribs and mac any day.  Service was attentive.  Definitely would go back!
1,"Lunch is fast and fresh and Kim @ the bar is the best...she must be, always filled with regular customers..."
1,"Yes I'm a meat lover.  Call me a caveman, I just love to eat a big juicy steak.   Being in Hawaii we are a little limited to steakhouses but I have been to most of them at least once.  Morton's, Hy's, DK's, Ruth Chris, and also other with steak like Kincaids, Shoreside Grill, and even Ruby Tuesdays.  Well, you get the jist.   I normally will opt for a Ribeye whenever possible and then maybe a NY or T-bone.  I like my meat to be juicy and have some fat so I normally don't get a filet.\n\nBeing we were heading out for Vegas I wanted to have a date night with my wife and get a good steak.  I asked my friend, who is a seasoned chef.  He lived and worked in Vegas for some years after grad-ing from the CIA and working at the Greenbrier among many other accomplishments both abroad and at home.  I figured he'd be the best person to ask for an honest opinion.  He recommended a few places we could try but said if given the choice we should go to CUT.  That sealed it, CUT it was.  I checked Open Table to see if I needed to book way ahead but it seemed like we should be fine booking a day in advanced.  Great considering we hardly know where we will be in Vegas day to day and hour to hour.  Once we were out there and could plan our schedule, we were able to lock down a reservation that would work for us.\n\nWe headed out a little early not know how long it would take me to find the parking garage and not know how far we would have to walk to get from the parking to the restaurant.  CUT is in the Palazzo hotel.  Parking was a breeze.  They had a guard asking where you were going so I guess maybe they restrict the parking to guest and customers.  We found a parking pretty close to the elevators which is amazing for a Vegas Casino.  Needless to say we had some time to explore before going to the restaurant.\n\nWe had a reservation at 9 and got there about 10 minutes early.  They were pretty packed.  They didn't have a regular table open yet but did offer us a table off to the side in the lounge area.  We decided to wait for a regular table, not wanting to miss out on the whole steakhouse experience.  We did go to the bar to kill our 10 minutes.  One think that irritated me at the bar was when I asked the bartender what kind of beer they had he immediately stated that they don't carry anything domestic like Bud Light or Coors.  Did I f**king say that's what I wanted??  All he had to do was provide me their drink menu, which is on an iPad for customer use.  Snooty bartender,  he should be happy I payed for those drinks with my total bill and didn't have to tip him separate.\n\nOnce seated we had the best service.  Our waiter was Chip and from what we saw, he was probably the head waiter as he was directing most of the other workers as he did his job.  He was very knowledgeable about their menu offerings and offered in-depth descriptions about everything they served.\n\nThe menu was a head turner.  They had so many things that sounded delicious.  One of those places you wished you were with a large party so you could sample more.  We decided on the Warm Asparagus, Poached Organic Egg, Warm Bacon Vinaigrette on a focaccia bread as our appetizer.  Along with that we also got  to pick from their selection of homemade breads and also got a couple or long parmesan coated breadsticks and butter puffs, or something like that.\n\nFor the main dish my wife got the Indian Spiced Kobe Beef shortribs which they slow cook for 8 hours.  They were very succulent and rich.  They had a distinct Indian flavor but not too overpowering.  It was also not very spicy at all.  The meat was so tender it was almost falling off the bone.  It was actually too much for my wife to finish.\n\nAfter Chip had explained the different lines of meats they carried I was sure I would need to get their sampler to get the best taste of what they had to offer.  I got their \""Tasting of New York Sirloin Sampler\"".  It came with a 4oz of Snake River Farms American \""Kobe\"" style beef, 4oz USDA Prime 35 day aged, and a 2oz of Blackmore Ranch Australian Wagyu.  It also came with a medley of different sauces and spices I could add to it.  None of which I needed to use.  They season their steaks with sea salt and black pepper.  It was seasoned perfectly so that the saltiness and pepper was not too overpowering and let the flavor of the beef shine through.  It tasted amazing.  And to be able to taste these 3 different lines of beef side by side really made it easy to see and taste the difference in quality.  All being top notch but clearly easy to rank.  Might make me come back for more Australian Wagyu on a future trip.  We also got a side of their mac and cheese that was suggested by the waiter.  Talk about rich and creamy, definitely a grown up mac and cheese.\n\nIf you ever are in Vegas and in search of a great steakhouse.  Make sure to put cut on the shortlist.  You definitely won't be disappointed.  Happy eats!"
0,"If it weren't for the location, there'd be no reason to go to this theatre. \n\nI went this past weekend with my family. Firstly, the escalators were broken and the only open concession was upstairs. We took the elevator. Then, after some indecision, I settled on something to eat - only to find out they don't have it! My dad, always the funny one, said, \""They even have prices for what they don't sell. And pictures too!\"" \n\nWe got our treats, found our theatre and claimed our seats. I walked next door while I munched and waited for my previews to start. The room next to ours felt like a sauna. Poor movie goers. That would suck to be stuck in a 85-degree room on a 105 degree day. Ugh. \n\nBathrooms were typical - no surprises there. \n\nThere are many other BETTER theatres to venture to on the weekend, or any other day, for that matter. I wouldn't recommend this place, unless you're already on Mill, you got your parking validated and you simply can't justify going somewhere else."
0,"Heads up to anyone checking out this business before going: I'll do the short version for you. If you've ever had Jamaican Caribbean food before, this place is not going to hit the spot. The majority of four and five star reviews are from people who don't know any better.\n\nI shop frequently at the nearby Sprouts grocery, and always mean to stop in here.\nBF picked up takeout last night for dinner, and said the restaurant smelled heavenly and took it as a good sign that all of the employees were actually Jamaican.\n\nGot home, and as others have said, takeout dishes are splashed everywhere- sauce out of the box and in the bag, one napkin and fork for two orders (and placed UNDER the takeout boxes in the bag in the puddle of spilled sauce), etc- little details that may slightly irritate, but not be relevant for dine-in customers.\n\nBut the food, despite smelling so good, was simply mediocre. All spice and no depth of flavor. Ordered the jerk chicken plate and the goat curry- and you could tell that both meats were indeed chicken and goat, but the similarities between the high quality versions of these dishes we've had elsewhere and what we actually received, was sad.\n\nThe jerk chicken was, for starters, dry. Rub seemed to be applied sparingly, and there was only flavor where you got seasoning. Good portion, but not necessarily good value. \nGoat curry sauce had a good consistency to it, and the meat was good, but the flavor was simply lacking- lacking depth, lacking that finger-licking jamaican flavor I'd come for. \nSides included a mixed veggie type dish that was overcooked mush, and \""rice and red beans\"" consisting mostly of rice and of a few scant red beans (I counted maybe 10) that appeared to be dried. When even your sides are underwhelming, there's a problem in the kitchen.\n\nThis was one of those rare times when the BF and I didn't finish our orders. And for about $30 for a week night take out dinner, that's pretty bad."

0,"If I could give this place 0 stars, I would.  Both location will go out of business as it is run by dishonest and unethical people.  Would not trust how they get their supplies or what they do to the food.  Stay away.  Go to Grimaldi's, Pizza Rock, or Custom Built pizza."
1,I was looking for a place to get some espresso. This was a couple of blocks from my hotel. It has a cool vibe and they know their beans.  The espresso was evenly and cleanly pulled and had a flavorful depth of flavor. A great place that I recommend.
1,"As someone who happens to be quite curious about new tastes and really unique quality food, I happen to try and enjoy the various cuisines rather than stuck up with what I loved (I find it a little bit boring too-no offense). Anyways, there are five things I prioritize when I walk into a restaurant; greeting, serving, remembrance of the food, price/standard ratio and tidiness. I do care about them not in a comparative way but from the \""what their real potential is\"" aspect.\n\nGreeting: First and foremost, you are always welcomed with warmth and hospitality of the owners or whoever is upfront working at that time. I cannot guarantee on behalf of them that it will always happen but considering the fact that I've been there more than 10 times and (more to go) It has been always like that. \n\nServing: Sky is the limit for the service. Restaurant business is carried by people and as long the \""intentions\"" of the owner or employees are striving for the best, I'm down for it. You can simply see that in owners or the waiters eyes that they just want to serve you in the best way possible. \n\nRemembrance of the food: I happen to see some bad comments about the quality of the food. I don't say they are manipulating the truth but I have no doubt that owners would compensate it if those individuals would request a better plate. It is a human driven place and people might make mistakes unintentionally. Based on my all visits, the food was just always a good remembrance of what I've enjoyed in my hometown and I will be their loyal customer as long as I have that feeling. \n\nPrice/standard ratio: Although this is very relevant and subjective issue, my opinion is the prices are fine. Yes, you can find some items a lot cheaper in somewhere else but that doesn't necessarily obliges the restaurant drops their prices. There are also other customers who keep buying from that \""Expensive\"" price so bear with it. \n\nTidiness: I think the place is clean and seems improving. I had the conversation with the owner and if he can realize what he is thinking about decoration, it might be one of a kind restaurants in Chandler with a combination of satisfactory food, nice atmosphere and great hospitality. \n\nPeople who knows me already are also aware of that restaurant indirectly but for those who don't know me, I definitely recommend this restaurant."
0,"The meat is generally decent, but it doesn't have the smoke flavor of the Chandler Dave's.   I can never smell smoke in the place or outside.   \n\nThe people are nice and the place is always clean.  The Saturday all day happy hour is a bonus.    Ribs and brisket are usually tender but the tri-tip is over-cooked."
1,"went there the other day for the second time, we happened to have coupons for a free burger, I ended up getting the Albacore Tuna sandwich with the sweet potatoe fries. Both were very flavorful and the tarter sauce on the sandwich was awesome. My husband got the Charburger and was equally as tasty. Last visit I got the tri-tip sandwich and was just as pleased. I would HIGHLY recommend it!"
0,"Came a second time- was lied to again-\nWas told I didn't need brakes(which was a lie) and instead I need something electrical done because I didn't need a bulb for the brake lights(he claimed he checked)\nSo i went and asked some guy at work- he was nice to check the issue out for me. I did need brakes and my bulbs did need to get replaced for the brake light- nothing electrical need to be done.(What is up with these jerks always trying to ripe off women) So the jerk is basically lying to folks.   I believe in karma, and when you do wrong then you will get yours. On that note if the store hours is posted at  6:00pm ,and I show up at 5:25pm then you need to cut off the lights since you are in a rush to get home."
1,"This is a very unique experience for fans of Chinese food.  The dishes are very creative and they mix in flavors not normally found in traditional Chinese.  I had heard good things about this place so I decided to try it out for myself, and wow were they right.  The decor is very creative with great art work on the walls makes the whole place look spacious but cozy at the same time.   And the food is just so good.  The shrimp and scallops are great, the duck is probably the best I've ever had."
1,"Pretty much all nail salons in Arizona are pretty similar. Feet soak, scrubbed then painted. Not alot of attention to callouses and rough skin  included with the base price which is kind of BS... but like I said, that seems to be the standard in AZ.\n\nWhat set this place apart for me is that she asked me WHY I was getting the pedi. I disclosed that I was departing shortly for a family trip to Hawaii and she suggested a FABULOUS festive nail idea.\n\nI have attached a photo of this master piece for your viewing enjoyment :)"
1,"After a day of shopping, my sister and I stopped at Marigold Maison for dinner. We were starving and excited to see all the options available.\n\nStarting off with wine, we sat down and tried not order the whole menu. Our waiter, Nick, suggested the Gol Guppa so we ordered that along with some Samosa Chaat, Bhel Puri, and Eggplant. Eggplant and Bhel Puri were great and the Samosa Chaat had a blast of flavors--- we LOVED the Gol Guppa. \n\nFor our entrees we got the Onion Naan Chicken Tikka and the Tandori Shrimp. Again, oh so yummy!!! I have never had Naan with onion before and after having this, I am not sure I ever will eat it any other way!! We ended up boxing up at least half of each dinner to take home. Guess we over did it little on the apps!\n\nSo even though we were pretty full, I really had to try the rice pudding. A friend of mine was there a week earlier and she could not stop talking about how amazing it was. My sister was a little apprehensive as she is not really a rice pudding kind of girl. However, it was a hit! I think she even ate more of it than I did.\n\nSo glad we stopped in! Can't wait to go again."

1,"Overall will recommend to anyone and will stay again, I will only list my complaints here. We got 3 nights comped, and were hoping to get our 4th night comped, but apparently the comp process is just too complicated for us to understand. No fridge, microwave, or coffeepot in the \""deluxe\"" room, you have to upgrade to a celebrity spa suite if you want a fridge (we didn't because we wanted two separate beds). The biggest complaint is that the TAXI STAND TAKES FOREVER. We waited in line at least 15 minutes every single time we took a taxi out of this place, and the doorman only brought up one taxi at a time, which I assume is because he was trying to get tips by opening up the taxi doors for the patrons. That was the only bad part. Overall this is my favorite casino in Vegas. Oh btw the lobby smells like roses. I love this."
1,"This place is surprising.  It's in a crappy looking run down shopping center and as you enter, it's a very narrow entryway.  When you get inside though, they have a big wine cellar (they have pages and pages of wines) and pictures of celeberties on the wall.  The food is absolutely great and reasonably priced.  It was packed in there within 15 minutes of opening for dinner.  The Rad Nah and the Tom Ka Gai soup were some of the best I've had.  I recommend this place, for sure!"
1,"20% off happy hour Monday through Thursday hooked me, because it is 9pm to midnight on all food. This place is fairly new and a hidden gem in the Wal-Mart Grocery shopping center (next to Lee's Liquor). I love the Yellowtail Jalapeno Sashimi and my fiance loves all the sake offerings on the menu. Service is great and speedy. A great local spot on this side of town that was needed. Enjoy."
1,"This location usually has great service, and the food is your standard Olive Garden fare. I've eaten here hundreds of times, and whether it is for a birthday, weekend lunch with friends, or quick lunch in the bar area on a weekday, I usually come away satisfied. Today, as I sit here typing, is a different story. I have yet to be greeted at the table - wait just got noticed and placed an order at the 50 minute mark. I was just curious how long I could take up space and not turn a table over. They beat the worst example of that - 1:15 wait for a server at Pedro's East a few years ago with the entire section turned over at least once before I was greeted. Let's see if the rest of the service can partially redeem the visit.\n\nUpdate:\nThe manager ran my credit card and then asked me how my visit was. I gave her an honest reply, and she offered me a $15 gift card, which was a few dollars more than my bill for the meal. So all in all, some of my time was wasted but I was fairly compensated for the disappointing service. The food was good as usual."
0,"Positive: My kids liked it.\nNegative: It is WAY too expensive.  It should cost about $30 for a family of four, not $80.  My annual pass that gets me into the NC aquariums and zoo is around $100.  It took less than an hour to see everything.  I do not recommend unless they lower the price significantly."
1,"I'm an Apple girl. But, when my dad got his first smart phone EVER last month we received a white glove experience.\n\nFrom start to finish this little pop up shop near Urban Outfitters showcased patience with my dad. I was appreciative of the time, care and attention to detail they displayed. Sometimes buying a technology product can be a humbling experience but the Microsoft Store was gracious in a way that would make me leave a 5 star review."
0,"I have been to the factory in Phoenix - wasn't the least bit impressed.  My family wanted to try this one - I was hoping for the best, but yet again I was disappointed.  Its like another Olive Garden with everything premade so its nothing special and you can't customize anything.  Its only the way on the menu and thats it - no special orders.  I dont know what the big hype is with this place, this isn't real Italian and its nothing to write home about, there was nothing to be impressed with from the soups to the lame salads to the meal - all was mediocre and if you ask me they charge to much for the quality of the food. I got the ravioli - totally lacked flavor and their marinara is bland as well. Now that I have had both places I hope to NEVER return - the food sucks."
1,"Been here twice, once with group of 4 and another with a group of  6.  Service was great and food was yummy.  I enjoyed the pizza made from their pizza oven and the spinach pear salad.  Chicken parm is huge with side of angel hair - delicious!  Also snaked a bite of the steak panini and stole a fry from my neighbor, very good.  I would say the only drawback to this place is looking out on the pool in the middle of a work day thinking that it should be you with the bucket of beer next to you soaking up the sun.  Check it out for sure."
1,"its the monday after a whirlwindish weekend in vegas. my head is throbbing, my stomach is slightly nauseous, and i'm sitting here with my camera in my hand flipping through the memories of this past weeked. WHY DO I NOT REMEMBER A DAMN THING? oh thats right. i had waaaaaayyyyyy too much to drink in a short amount of time. so as i flip through my camera i notice the following:\n\n1. me looking relatively sober. i remember this pic. i think we were getting ready to go out. oh look how happy i look.\n2. me at Tao. yes. i went to Tao. i remember that. \n3. me at Diablos with friends. where the hell is Diablos? how did we get there? did we take a cab? who's that weird guy in the back? \n4. me with my head in between the boobs of a woman sittng on the bar who is pouring alcohol down my throat. from the looks of her she works there. god, i hope she works there. do i remember this? not so much.\n5. jagerbombs. lots of them. in a row. who bought these? \n6. tequila shots!?!???!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!? wtf is wrong with my friends?\n7. me smiling and sitting next to some guy. vague memories of him being from alaska maybe? alabama? one of the A states. sure why not.\n\ni woke at 11a the next morning with a vague memory of awesomeness. according to my friends' accounts, i was in rare form and diablo's was there to provide all sorts of alcoholic debauchery. i also somehow managed to completely lose my treo and my dignity. 4 stars, diablo's."
0,"My score could go lower or higher, so think of the 2 stars as an average. I've been to Sushi Creek several times now and there have been good experiences along with some bad.  The service is slow & clunky at best.  I'd much rather go to Kona @ San Tan."
0,"The store reeks of rotting fish, the security guards watch you like a hawk and the food selection is the worse I've seen in any Giant Eagle in the city.\n\nOne plus if you must shop here there are plenty of jitney drivers waiting for you to come out to offer you a ride.  That can be a big help if you are like me and don't have a car. \""Need a car\"" haha some things about living in the hood just never change. \n\nWith this being the closet G E to Downtown and PNC Park and Heinz field I would think they would renovate but it's been years and still no change."
0,"Worst car rental and customer service  experience of my LIFE. \n\nWhen I rent a car a few weeks in advance of my trip, it better be there. My experience began with a 30 min wait in line (at 10pm on a Wednesday). There were only 2 or 3 reps yet a long line of customers. Meanwhile other rental car lines were moving along relatively speedily. But this wasn't what irritated me. \n\nNo, the reason I'm leaving a review is partially to pass the HOUR+ I've been waiting to receive the car that should have been ready for me at my designated pick-up time. I would understand if I was a walk-up customer and there weren't cars available. But how are there not cars available when my reservation was in the system (along with the dozens of irritated customers). This is absurd.  \n\nThe worst part is how flippant the rep was about it - no attempts to remedy the situation, no apologies even. We were also given a 45 min wait time but were told it would likely be much \""sooner.\"" Well it's been 1:15 and still no car.\n\nTo add insult to injury, we noticed that other people who had come after us had gotten their cars and then were given the advice by a fellow sufferer to talk to a rep because they weren't coming out to the waiting area and calling our name as they had promised. She had gotten bypassed and had we not talked to the rep, we would have too. \n\nI will NEVER give business to Hertz again and will be sure to spread the word, starting with this review. If I could, I would rate Hertz  negative 4 stars instead of 1."

0,"Oddly, as I was eating my croissant I received a text from my friend who I was to eat lunch with later that day - he had made it to town early and was going to be stuck at the Olympia all afternoon - he wanted to know if we could make it breakfast instead.  Certainly not full after two small pastries I agreed and he suggested we meet over at the Wynn - near the poker room.  As previously noted, I'm usually a man with a plan when it comes to eating on vacation so the walk over to the Wynn provided me ample time to think of a good spot - eventually deciding to get out of the Wynn, check out Encore, and grab breakfast at  Caf\u00e9 Society Encore.\n\nArriving just after 9:00am I was surprised to find the large restaurant packed and my friend and I opted to sit at the bar rather than wait 20 minutes for a table.  Seated promptly and provided with menus our drink orders were taken - a coffee for myself and a $9 (ouch) vanilla protein shake for my friend.  While he noted the shake was tasty my friend was admittedly shocked when the bill arrived - even using the best whey on the market there is no way this shake was more than $1 worth of ingredients.  My coffee, also expensive at $4 for a relatively average brew, was refilled slowly at best - and only when I asked.  All this despite there being two bartenders and only one other person at the 10-seat bar.\n\nPlacing our orders next my buddy opted for the waffle with blueberries, a side of egg whites, and an English muffin - all of which he stated were good but \""overpriced\"" while I myself chose the Frosted Flake French Toast with Caramelized Bananas and Chocolate Cream.  Arriving after a relatively short wait the dish contained two pieces of brioche dipped in frosted flakes and topped with perhaps one half of a caramelized banana plus a small dollop of creamy but decidedly unchocolately chocolate cream.  Taking an initial bite I have to admit the quality of the bread itself was marvelous and the bananas were wonderful while the chocolate lacked.  Adding a few tablespoons of pure Vermont maple syrup definitely helped the dish - mostly by adding a bit of sweetness but also by bringing forth some of the more subtle vanilla and cinnamon tones of the bread.  A good dish, but at $15 nearly twice the price of the vastly superior and larger French toast at m.henry in Chicago and more expensive than either Keller's or The Country Club's wonderful bread-pudding-style French Toasts in Vegas. \n\nSitting for a while and chatting with my friend - later making plans for another brunch a couple days later I was glad that we were not rushed out but a little disappointed that I had to ask more than once for a coffee refill and that my water glass was taken away after a single glass and never returned.  In the end the total cost for the meal was nearly $50 for food that was good but not great and service that was present at best.  Paying our bill we walked away largely unimpressed - having had breakfasts at multiple places in Vegas now I'd steer clear and make my way to Bouchon, Mon Ami Gabi, The Country Club, or Tableau first - for the price you could even cab it to Hash-House-A-Go-Go and eat cheaper (and perhaps better) - but then if you did that you probably wouldn't have room for lunch and dinner."
0,"TERRIBLE. Rude employees- I will NEVER come here to bowl.\n I have never rated a place this low EVER in my yelp history- but I have never had this bad of an experience at any place in my life. \n\nAs soon as I walked in the door and walked up the stairs- the bouncer looked me up and down, and then asked me (or yelled at me rather)- \""WHO ARE YOU WITH?\"". I patiently relplied- I'm not with anyone- I just wanted to go to the bar for a quick drink. To which he yelled (I don't know why he was yelling at me because I was quietly answering- \""IF YOU AREN\""T PAYING TO BOWL- YOU CAN\""T DRINK IN OUR BAR.\""\n\nSeriously!!?? First - you can look at my previous ratings on yelp to see I'm certainly not a dramatic person- I can't not believe how rudely I was treated at this place.\n\nJust because you are the \""hip\"" place to go doesn't mean you cant treat someone like trash for no reason. DON'T GO HERE if you care at all about customer service.\n\nI've tried to come here to bowl three times within the past month and each time I've come I've been turned away rudely."
0,"Waaaaay overpriced for what you get.  Portions were huge, and dishes were either overly sweet or overly salty.  There are much better ways to spend your money than Tao.\n\nI got the Miso Glazed Sea Bass (~$40), and as my husband described it tasted like \""fancy fish sticks wiht sweet sauce\"".  The fish was huge and very sweet, served with some veggies drenched in sauce/oil.  I also ordered a wine to go with my meal; it was just okay.  This sounds picky, but the wine glass it came in was the same as a crappy set I owned in college.  I couldn't help feeling like I was back at a college party.  A restaurant that expensive could afford a nice wine glass at least.\n\nMy husband got the Seared Ahi Tuna (~$35), and they were really salty.  The tuna itself wasn't great; you could hardly taste it.\n\nOn a side note, if you eat at the restaurant you can get in to the night club as a VIP - just ask the waitstaff to get your wrist stamped."
1,"I studied abroad in Spain so I was excited to try a tapas kitchen in town. Went with a decent sized group and ordered a good selection off the menu... Wasn't let down by any of the food. It was all really good. This will sound snobby and I can't do anything about it but, a lot of them weren't the traditional Spanish tapas or pintxos (Basque Country) we ate abroad, but still good. HOWEVER the ones that were traditional Spanish or Basque WERE AWESOME. I got completely nostalgic and felt like I was back there. If you can, try to go during happy hour (Monday-Sunday 3-6pm) otherwise you will leave with your wallet pretty worked out as they charge generally $5-8 per dish."
1,"Ok, so I'm being slightly generous.  This should actually be a 3.5 stars, and not 4.\n\nThe Gyros was decent, the tzatziki sauce was good, my problem was that the tomatoes were cut too big and hard to eat, being big chunks in there.  The fries were ok.  I guess I should explore the menu more next time around, if there is a next time around.\n\nIt's relatively cheap, and a decent break from all the buffet in vegas."
1,Absolutely awesome experience. Traveling through on business and decided I needed a new tattoo. Anthony managed to work me in and did a fantastic job. Nice atmosphere with some amazing artwork on display too. I'll be back.
0,"Perhaps the least competent service I have ever received. \n\nIt took 30 minutes to get my first drink, this despite the fact that when I arrived waitresses outnumbered patrons. I ordered five drinks, each time the waitress would leave for 5 minutes before returning to notify me that beverage was sold out. On the sixth order she finally brought me the Magners I requested on order #3 when the managers pointed out to her they weren't actually sold out. The waitress claimed that they were changing all the drafts out to new beers which was why so many were out but couldn't tell us what new beers were available and I have never heard of a bar changing out so many beers at once rather than when a keg kicks (especially not a few hours before a game)\n\nI finished that drink and then waited 15 minutes for the waitress to notice me and then 30 more to get another order actually brought to me from the bar (I had to actually stand up and find the waitress who then signaled to another waitress to bring the drinks to our table). It was still 2.5 hours before the Pirate game and the place was less than 1/2 full.\n\nMy guests and I waited for about 30 minutes from there before a girl set up a cooler on the sidewalk and we got the rest of our beverages from her. Finally we wanted to leave and tried to get our checks from the waitress, this required another visit to go track her down on the floor and say we wanted to leave, 15 minutes later she was still not to our table with a check but was just chatting by the Micros POS machine so I went and asked again, this time I was told she transferred our check to someone else (she didn't know who) and they had to get our check. At this point I was ready to just walk out but the other people I was with wouldn't let me and we waited until the 3rd inning before we finally got someone to bring us a check and then take payment.\n\nI won't be going back again. I won't be recommending it to friends."
1,"Wings and fries were great! Honey Hot wing sauce was delicious and the blue cheese dressing was absolutely the best I've had in awhile. The only problem was the grilled wings came out ice cold! However,  They didnt have any problem taking them back. Laid back atmosphere. I will be back in the near future!"
1,"OK, let's be clear here, The Penguin is NOT closed. It is reopening in January 2011, that's been established by the family that has actually owned this awesome place for over 50 years. I can't wait to get in there an harden my arteries once again! Great burgers, fried pickles, cheap beer!!"
0,"This rag looks cool.  They review all the trendy-ass-kissing bands.  They have a great layout.  And they want so badly to be a mover and a shaker in the community.   \n\nSo what's wrong?\n\nThey (like a lot of publications) are entirely blinded by the bottom line (rather than readership), which is why you'll NEVER see them be even a little critical of ANY local business no matter how crappy they are.  Everything in this rag is GREAT and GROOVY and COOL.  \n\nAll style.  Zero credibility."
0,"Great food, horrible customer service!  I purchased a Groupon in June and went there with my husband.  The food was excellent and the waiter was extremely nice and accommodating.  Consequently, I returned and later bought another groupon when they came out in July.  However, the next trip was a complete 180.  I spent about $70 on food and drink for my daughter and myself.  When ready to leave, I presented the Groupon to our waiter (different waiter, older, some sort of accent).  Evidently he pushed the \""redeem\"" button because he handed the phone back to me with the message, \"" Are you certain you want to redeem this Groupon.\""  And, told me there was something wrong with my phone.  I explained it was just prompting us to redeem the Groupon.  He seemed confused, so, I pressed, \""Yes.\""  Unfortunately, he had apparently not written the code down.  Consequently, he told me I could not use the Groupon and accused me, in front of all the other customers, of trying to rip him off by using an expired Groupon.  I was livid because no matter how I or my daughter tried to explain it to him, he would not listen.  I asked to speak with the manager.  However, he told me he was the owner.  At that point, we left and I informed him I would never return.  After we got home, my daughter, still very upset, called to speak with him.  He continued to refuse to listen and offered no solution.  All of this nonsense over a Groupon that would have cost the business $10, since they had already received the $10 I spent on it.  \n\nAs it turned out, he was not the owner.  The owner called my daughter the next day and apologized, stating that she would make it right.  She suggested I stop payment on the transaction.  However, I was told by the bank that debit transactions cannot be stopped.  I relayed this message to the owner, but have never received a response.  So,  I can only assume that she has no intention of making it right, either   I can't believe any concerned business owner would let an employee  treat customers that way and not make it right.  Bon Chef has lost my family's business and I will not hesitate to inform everyone who asks me about the cafe what my last experience was like.  Bon Chef, \""Shame on you!\"""
1,"Sat at the bar for a drink. The Old Fashioned is well balanced, but a bit sweeter than most. One of the best I've had in Vegas. Ended up getting the fried rice, 2x Fried Chicken and the chicken skin. Sounds crazy... But it's pretty tasty. The rice was the best of the bunch. Service was very knowledgeable but relaxed."
1,"THey make an incredible martini.  The food is very good.  It is not Capital Grille.  It is not Mortons.  It is a good, solid resturant with good seafood."
0,"First time visitor to CityCenter and Aria.\n\nCrystals is nothing special. Very plain looking as has been mentioned many times.\n\nAs to Aria, for the most part we could hardly wait to get out of there.\nWe were simply uncomfortable with the design. The overall feel is busy with too many curves, lines and architectural drama.\n\nIt was very noisy with conversations floating all over the place.\n\nWe were simply not impressed with the visual busyness, like everywhere you looked there was something different design wise going on, and it was disturbing.\n\nWhat stood out for me was coming down an escalator from upstairs where the Elvis theater is looking straight ahead you get the pleasure of seeing pipes and electrical boxes.\n\nTen billion dollars and the worlds greatest designers and architects and what is visual from the escalator are pipes and electrical boxes.\n\nAmazing.\n\nI myself never liked the look and scope of CityCenter when it was under construction and I like it less now that I have been there.\n \nWe're never going back, it's too big and too confusing and too upsetting to even be there."
1,"I don't know much about beer, but I can say that the ones served here are great. I ended up sampling some of the Drak and a Rousse, both of which were enjoyable.\n\nThe menu is kind of strange, but has a variety of options and they're affordable too. If you're vegan, I don't think you'll have much luck here, as most of the menu consists of some sort of animal product. There is a veggie burger, but when it was asked if the burger was put on the same grill as the meat, apparently it was. If you wanted to have it on a separate grill, you had to request to do so- that shouldn't be the case. That's my one complaint about this place, being a vegetarian and all.\n\nMy group ended up ordering the nachos, and the portion was large enough to be shared amongst ourselves. It was piled high with cheese, olives, hot peppers, and came served with salsa and sour cream.\n\nThe atmosphere of this place is great, even if it gets really noisy sometimes. The ceilings are high, and there are three levels with tables to sit at. If you can, head upstairs to the top floor and sit by the window, where you'll get a great view of St-Denis.\n\nDefinitely coming back here next time I visit Montreal."
0,"I don't expect much from any fast food restaurant.  Truth be told, no honest person does.  It's fast food.  If we wanted a lot, we would just make it ourselves.  What I do expect, and what most people expect is reliability.  That's it... reliability.\n\nThat is something that this particular location of Taco Bell sorely lacks.  I have been there at 10:30, and they're open.  I have been there at 11:55, and they're open.  I even asked the hours once.  I was told that Sunday-Thursday, this location is open until 12:00AM, and on the weekends, they are open until 1:00AM.  Yet... they are unreliable...I wonder if the owner knows their staff closes early?\n\nOut of the last six times I have been to this location - on a weeknight - between 11:00 and 11:30 - they have been closed.  Sometimes they are open... sometimes they are closed.  You never know with this place.  If the owner were to check the power bill by the hour and see when the bill dropped off, they would be aware because the signs are off, the exterior lights are off, and the interior lights are off.  Don't advertise you are open if you're not going to be open.\n\nI went by tonight at 11:10PM and everything was off.  I work in a restaurant and don't want to go home and cook for myself on the nights that I work because I spend 8 hours cooking for other people while I'm at work.  I really wanted Taco Bell tonight, but because of the unreliability of this location, I spent my money elsewhere.  \n\nI really just hope the owner of this location gets a handle on the hours of their store.  Inconsistency is not okay.  If the employees want to close at 11:00 like they apparently did tonight (like I said, the sign-lights were off, the drive thru lights were off, the interior lights were off... on the whole, the place screamed, \""Don't spend your money here!\""), then that is fine... just be open about it.  Don't promise the public hours and don't deliver.\n\nI know this is a long review for Taco Bell, but I kept pulling for this place to get it together.  After four months of never knowing what the hours were going to be at this location, I finally convinced myself to write a review.  In a simple phrase... \""This location lacks on the most important function of customer service: Consistency.  There is none.\"""

0,"Been here for my root canal crowning & 4 dental fillings. The experience was alright. Not as good as the reviews suggested. \n\nI'd exhausted my annual insurance benefits , so they did work around that with me & gave me a plan that made economic sense to me. But the quality of work is what i'm not so confident about.\n\nI felt their push so i could get more fillings.\n\nThey identified i needed 8-9 fillings. I settled for 4 which actually made apparent sense to me. \nI felt that the cleanup(digging ) they did before doing the filling was a little too much compared to my previous dentist visits.\nAnd one of the four fillings i received developed sensitivity within 4 months ! And i do take very good care of my teeth - regular brushing, flossing , eating habits."
1,I just started tanning here... so far I think they are great - They seem to have nice clean beds and all the employees are so friendly
1,"Recommend it. Made me horny, enjoyed the performances and the hot chicks, appreciated the sensuality, what else is there? It's Vegas and if you're a couple mos def something good to wet the appetite, if you're into that like me. =P Our seats were at the front row but on the left side of the stage. Nice views that were closeup and intimate, but I've heard it's better to sit in the middle and further back to see the full scope of the stage. I dunno about that but I enjoyed the close up view myself. Pricey but worth it, afterall it's Vegas baby!"
0,"Outback is better, cheaper, and way less Stuffy.  A restaurant should start to re-examine their quality if they can sit at the last minute on friday or saturday night.  The prices are ridiculous for the quality of the food.  If I pay $50 for a filet minion, I expect for it to knock my socks off.  It was underseasoned and the outer portions were actually dry on a medium cooked steak.  We paid $18 for the mac and cheese, recommended by other yelp reviews, and the mushrooms.  I don't understand how mushrooms could be so bland, and if it was. $25 steak dinner including the mac and cheese that would have been worth it.  The mac and cheese was the most interesting thing we got and it was slightly amusing at best.  Overpriced.... stay far far far far far away from this Stuffy restaurant.  Worst meal in vegas and most expensive."
0,"Never again will I come here as a piece of wood ended up in my rolled tacos. I'm usually a forgiving person when it comes to stuff like this but one of my front teeth is fake and probably could have busted biting down on A PIECE OF WOOD. No thanks, Robbie. I'll just have to find somewhere else for my late night post-work food needs. Ew."
0,"This was a poor excuse for a steakhouse. While the sandwiches and other fair is ok, their steaks are not. They try to entice you by displaying the steaks in their dry age case. Don't get sucked into thinking they taste good. My friend and I recently went there for a bachelor party and we had about 6 different steaks. None were good. They may have been cooked to order, but it took them 30 minutes to serve the steaks after ordering them. I had the 1/2 pound hamburger. It was awful. I've had better burgers at Carl's Jr. \n\nBottom line-don't come here for the beef"

1,"We came to Flemings for our 30th wedding  anniversary after reading a lot of review's on yelp for steak houses in Vegas I kept coming back to this review ... Well let me tell you there was no disappointment in our choosing...  My husband is very hard to please when it comes to steaks as we raise our own grass fed beef he was amazed at how good the flavor,tenderness,of the Bone in Ribeye was I had the Petite Filet which was equally amazing... Both steaks were cooked to perfection sides were well proportioned...  The service (TJ) was great as well... I really liked that fact that even though this is a A+ restaurant in my opinion it has a very comfortable feel to it.... One short minus no Coors Light or Oyster's on the half shell... The Calamari was great as well.... We will defiantly be back......"
0,"By far, the least impressive Cirque du Soleil show I have seen.  The performers are all amazing, but for some reason, it was not showcased or directed well.\n\nWe spent over $130 on each ticket, and we had excellent seats, which were very comfortable, But the show seem to drag on.  The sand artist was really cool and different."
1,"This place made me sign onto Yelp and write a review again after a long hiatus. Simply put AMAZING. This place is in the conversation as the BEST place in all of Las Vegas. Yes I am serious. It is in fact the best \""hidden gem\"" in Las Vegas. Apparently it has only been open for 3 months which explains why there are few reviews, but I promise you this place will blow up. Let 's get started.\n\n    I litteraly wanted to try every appetizer they had however I asked our waiterss (Nicole) if she had choice of trying every single appetizer OR trying 3 of them and a steak which would she do? She replied \"" Apps & steak\"". I took her advice... and was I glad I did!!\n\n\nAppetizer(s)\n\n1. Applewood Bacon Jalapeno Prawns, 5 Stars, wonderfull! Flavorfull and delicous a solid choice!\n\n2. Lobster Cake, 4 stars. It was good not exceptional, but very good.\n\n3. PBJ Baggeutte with Bacon & Blue Cheese. Well words cannot describe this item. It is litteraly one of the best things I have ever eaten. So good in fact I ordered 2 of them, I am not ashamed to admit it! PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE do not be discouraged by this item!! If you like blue cheese you will like this item!! I am a meat and potatoes guy, I really don't do much \""exotic\"" stuff. trust me when I say, This item is legendary! 5 stars\n\nEntree(s)\n\n1. Fish and chips. 4 stars, very good but I am not a sweet potatoe fry fan, if I were it may get 4.5 stars. The Tartar sauce that came with it is excellent (my mother had this, I only had a couple bites)\n\n2. Twin Lobster tails. 5 stars. It's hard to mess up lobster tails. LOL. These were a decent size and cooked perfectly. ( My sweetie had this, again only a few bites)\n\n3. Ribeye Steak. 5 Stars. The key to this ladies and gents is to get the blue cheese butter!! AGAIN, GET THE BLUE CHEESE BUTTER! This was quite simply delicious!! Amazing steak! And they cook steak medium plus!! ( that's in between medium and medium well for those that don't know)\n\nSides\n\nCorn on the Cob squares? Not sure on the techical name on these, but basically they are corn on the cob, grilled, sliced down the center and put into quarters. The have it with some spicy peppers so these have a kick!! However they were great! 5 stars\n\nMashed Potatoe Croquttes. Excellent cooked perfectly! Very tasty! 5 Stars! You only get 3 in an order though.\n\nDesert\n\nWell... I dare not even write about it, this was a \""special item\"" that is only served on Christamas day! I don't want to get anyones hopes up only to not be able to try it. It was in my top 3 desserts I have ever had in my life! Yes, in my life!!! They will be having it back next year for Christmas, and, I will be there. I was threatened at gunpoint by my mother if I didn't take her back here. And if you were wondering... I ordered two of these as well :) LOL.\n\n\nIn a nutshell this place was beyond my hopes and dreams! If your a local this is one of the few reasons to travel to the strip! If your not local you have to go here before going back home! Trust me, you won't regret it!!! The prices for a steakhouse on the strip are VERY reasonable! They could charge double for thier items easily."
0,"As I told my husband, \""I don't mind hipsters, but I don't want them serving me my food.\"" He really likes OTB (as you can see from his review and 22 check-ins), and I finally tried the restaurant with him this Friday night. I was definitely underwhelmed.\n\nWe started with drinks, and I ordered the Spiced Cider. It was a spiked apple cider that tasted a lot more apple cider than spiked. The only reason that I knew it contained alcohol was because I became very tired half way through the meal. I also had to order the pierogies as they are one of my favorite comfort foods. These were literally the worst pierogies that I have ever had.... I mean, c'mon, if you want to serve frozen pierogies heated in the microwave in Florida, that's fine because no one will know what you're serving anyway. However, this is Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and you should not microwave your frozen pierogies.\n\nI must admit that my burger was pretty tasty. I ordered The Fixie, which is a burger covered with blackberry preserves and the incredible Wholey's peanut butter. However, the fact that the top bun was too thick and the bottom bun was non-existent just frustrated me. It was extremely difficult to eat, and I even ate a portion of it with a fork.\n\nOur waitress was just as frustrating as those microwaved pierogies. She was relatively attentive in the beginning. However, we finished our meals, and a busboy came and picked up our plates. We literally sat for a good 20 minutes as she just served the back portion of the restaurant, ignoring her three tables in the front. I almost lost it when I saw her hanging out with her coworkers and friends and eating behind the bar. \n\nFinally, the other patrons were annoying. Two or three loud guys were randomly chatting about drunken nonsense, such as getting \""lit up because it's light up night.\"" I mean... it's 5:30pm on a Friday night... are you seriously that drunk already?\n\nOverall, I was unimpressed and do not have a desire to return. Even though the burger was very tasty, the rest of the food and experience was poor."
1,"I like the unusual flavor combinations on the dogs (fruit, coconut with spicy) and it tastes good! It's not trying to be anything it's not."
0,"I went there on a Friday night and it was a very casual, laid-back environment.  The waiter told us to just pick any table we wanted, and didn't mind when we sat at a table meant for 8 since it was the only one open.  They recommended a lovely malbec to go with our meal that I wish didn't come out warm.  We ordered:\nA pork belly appetizer that I was excited to try but it ended up coming out as an empanada with the pork belly shredded and pulverized.   Travesty.\nCharcuterie plate - the cheese was good, but the meat came out shredded into little pieces.  Not necessarily a bad thing, but just weird.  \nRomaine wedge salad - nothing special but it was good \nCrab gnocchi - HORRIBLE.  I've never had such bad gnocchi before.  I don't know what they did to that potato but it was tasteless and had the consistency of clay.  \nI would not recommend it to anybody."
0,"Don Pedros or DP's as we call it out here.  I will tell you this,, I love the location of the place since i live right down the street ,  but as far as the food goes,,  It is edible,, but mediocre compared to the other mexican joints i have been to.  I really hoped that they would have good food, being so close to the house but it just doesnt do it.  I actually will drive 10 miles past it to go to Ricos on power & Riggs.  If you want good mexican food and you dont mind driving a little ways,  go to \""Xaviers Casa Reynoso\"" on Val Vista & Southern.  You will definitely forget about DP's.."

1,"WOW! You'd never notice this place if you weren't looking for it. I had some family in town and this place is pretty close to where I live, after reading the Yelp reviews we decided to give it a shot and treat ourselves to some deluxe pedicures. The chairs were comfortable and the shop looked and felt clean and taken care of. My pedicure was fantastic, the place was pretty busy but I never felt like I was being rushed. The nail tech took his time and the whole experience from the calf and foot massage to the moisturizing cream was wonderful. Everyone in the salon was very friendly, we were warmly greeted when we walked in, the staff was professional and personable while we were there, and we were sincerely thanked for coming in on our way out.  I will definitely be back!"

0,"The name \""Palatte\"" is purportedly a combination of \""palate\"" and \""palette.\""  Sadly, I found nothing pleasing to my palate here and any aspirations of artistry are just that.\n\nI had heard good things about this place and I brought the BF here one afternoon to give it a try.  We won't be back.  My guess is that Palatte is the first restaurant that Christine and Edward McHale have run.  This operation is amateurish and in desperate need of a good short order cook.  Perhaps the owners can poach one from Matt's Big Breakfast.  \n\nLet's start with the whole \""service\"" concept.  We showed up toward the end of lunch and there were several staff members lurking about.  We kept looking for a host stand and the staff saw us obviously trying to figure out what to do, but no one offered to give us any guidance.  Finally, we made our way into the house and the BF figured out that we had to order at the counter.  Palatte has decided to go with the lazy approach of making customers order at a counter and schlep a numbered marker to a table for the \""server\"" to find later for food delivery.\n\nWe decided to start off with a pineapple upside down muffin.  It turned out to be bland and dry.  Since Palatte desperately tries to lean toward the French, they should mix in some \""sucre\"" so that their baked goods actually have some taste.\n\nThe BF and I decided to split the sweet potato pancakes after hearing so much about them.  The menu proclaims that the pancakes combine sweet potatoes with mascarpone cheese, pecans and maple syrup. The end result is an abomination.  The pancakes must have been seriously over-mixed as they were absolutely rubbery and yet tasteless.  When a restaurant's signature dish is this bad, things can only go downhill.\n\nI ordered The Potato \""Mish-Mash,\"" which is really a $9 plate of scrambled eggs with potatoes, bacon, spinach, onion, Gouda and Monterrey Jack.  It was okay, but the portion was tres, tres petit.  The Breakfast Potatoes on the side were a disgrace.  They were par-boiled potatoes that had been sitting around for hours.  I know because I saw a huge pile of them in the kitchen when we placed our order at the counter.  The kitchen barely warmed them before plunking them on my plate.  They weren't even showing the faintest hint of brown.  Sacrebleu!  If you want real breakfast potatoes, go for the hash browns at Matt's Big Breakfast where you can get a decent breakfast in downtown.  But back to les pommes de terre aux Palatte; they're served with creme fraiche for dipping.  When Edward brought my plate to the table, I asked for a side of ketchup.  Edward directed me to try the creme fraiche first before he would bring me the ketchup.  Here's the deal, Ed.  I've eaten in some of the finest restaurants in the world.  I don't need to be coerced into trying your creme fraiche and it actually works better on the scrambled eggs.  I asked for the ketchup to try to mask the taste of your pathetic potatoes.\n\nA faux French vibe permeates Palatte.  This place looks like what Sage Antiques might look like if robbers broke in during the middle of the night and cleared out everything of value or perhaps a vintage southern home after the estate sale.  What's with the pile of old barrel drums in the corner of the yard?\n\nFor over $40 for two, we could have gone to a Arcadia Farms for a delightful brunch.\n\nBonne chance, Palatte.  You're going to need it!"
1,"I wasn't in the mood for Mexican food before showing up here but my mood quickly changed.  I judge a Mexican restaurant mainly on basic staples: tortilla chips, salsa, guacamole, and quality of the meat.  If these are great, then everything else is good.  Everything was top notch.  The guacamole was fresh and delicious, the standout was the carnitas.  Very tender and flavorful.\n\nDon't think about it, just go to Javier's!"
0,"My husband and I used to eat at this restaurant all the time.  We always loved the food.  However, the last time we were there , the manager disagreed with where we asked to be seated based on the placement of our highchair.  We did not realize that it was a problem.  Afterall, the hostess sat us there.\n\nWhen the manager saw what happened, he aggressively approached our table, rapped his knuckles on the table, and loudly imformed us that \""this was never happening again\"".  You betcha, Buddy, because after being chewed out by this manager like I was a tardy dishwasher, we weren't coming back.  I was angry and embarassed as this manager was loud enough that people at other tables were staring at us, so I emailed the restaurant's corporate offices right there from my phone.\n\nA few days later, I received a phone call from the restaurant's general manager.  I think that her name was Lisa. At first, I thought that Lisa was going to work this out with me, perhaps apologize for her underling's poor behavior. That just wasn't going to happen.  What Lisa gave me was a second butt chewing.  She interrupted me time and again, and even accused me of being a bad mother because the placement of the highchair was dangerous and against city code, that she was more concerned about the safety of my child than I was.  Had she stopped talking over me for 2 seconds, she would have learned that my husband is an architect and has forgotten more about building and city codes than some diner manager would ever know.  What she didn't know that my husband did know was that the placement of the highchair was well within city egress requirements.\n\nShe then claimed to have reviewed the tape of the manager approaching our table and she that the table rapping never happened.  She was lying.  It did happen.  I saw it.  My husband saw it, and my baby jumped when he did it.  She either did not review the tape or there was no tape to review.  I seriously doubt that they have cameras trained on every table in any restaurant, much less a pancake diner.  \n\nDuring this entire conversation, I kept trying to get a word in edgewise to complain about the way the first manager all but yelled at us.  It was awful, and soon as she was done verbally abusing me, she said goodbye and HUNG UP on me.  I was shocked.  She never had any intention of working this out.  Her intention was to bully me for daring to complain about one of her co-workers.  And sadly, we have lost one of our favorite breakfast spots because I will not contribute a nickel to that woman's salary.\n\nI had heard, maybe it's true, maybe it's not, that several restaurants in casinos had recently closed their doors.  If this is how they allow their manager to speak to people, I am not the least bit surprised.  I have since told everyone I know about the abuse that I suffered at this woman's hands and will continue to bad mouth this restaurant every opportunity I get."
0,"So I'm sitting at a table at Sushi 101 after waiting 40 minutes to even get seated. While I know the food is more than desirable, the service is utterly chaotic. When first walking in, there were crowds of people with drinks and it was difficult to even find a hostess. When finally reaching one, I put our name in for a table of three. She approximates a 30 minute wait which would have allowed us to receive the Happy Hour discount which ends at 7:00 pm. When we finally got seated at 7:02 the table wasn't even set up. We waited another 2 minutes for a third chair and another 10 minutes before a waitress even came over to introduce herself and take our drink orders. And 7 minutes later we got our drinks. I understand that I shouldn't base judgement on the waitress due to the crowds, however when we finally put in our food order we were told the sushi was going to take about 30-45 minutes before even coming out. I guess I'll post another review when we get our food."
0,"I went there because I read reviews talking about a happy hour with half price rolls. I was there when it opened yesterday, and was seated at the sushi bar immediately. I was given the \""happy hour menu\"", and started looking at the prices... $4.75 for a California roll... $9 for their special rolls... I was like \""this is half price?\"". I decided to stay, since it was cheaper than a normal night for sushi.\n\nI wish I hadn't... not because of the food... but because of the treatment by the chefs. I ordered a total of 3 hand rolls, 1 special roll, and 2 other rolls. I was hungry, hadn't had lunch, and wanted to treat myself. I handed the first chef my menu. A second chef came in and began conversing with him in Spanish about work. Then the unthinkable happened... they started bad mouthing the fat white guy (me) sitting at the bar in front of them.\n\nThe 2nd chef asked the first: \""Todos?\"" (All of it?), to which the other replied \""Si, todos\"" (Yes, all of it.). Then the 2nd chef said \""No lo creo\"" (I don't believe it).\n\nSo, being the polite guy that I am, I smiled at them and asked them (in English) to give me 1 or 2 rolls at a time. Instead, I get two platters of all of the sushi I ordered.\n\nI said nothing - my waiter continued coming back to check on me. The check came, and I figured I should say something. So I wrote on the ticket: \""Por favor, pregunte a sus camareros para no hablar mal de sus clientes en espanol?\"" (Please ask your chefs to not speak badly about your customers in Spanish?). I got up from the bar, and told them \""Gracias por la comida\"", and walked away.\n\nNot even 10 minutes after I left, I get a phone call from the owner/manager. I tell him I am driving, but he wants to keep talking. I apologize and say I will call him back when I get home. I get home, and call him back. He said his chefs never said that, but apologized. He offered me a free dinner if I come back. I might do that, since the food was good. But - you know how when you go to a restaurant and while the food is ok, if the service is great you still walk away and give it a favorable review? Well, this is the opposite. Food is ok, service sucked. -1 star for the chefs."
0,"its too cold in the dining room and the music is way too loud.  why not make it warm and inviting and play some family friendly classical music. the workers, who are young, like the music which is hip hop and pop with some very bad lyrics and sometimes obscene language, because I have heard them mention it. they tend to sit a lot in the small two seat booth adjacent to the door that leads to the kitchen. I would like to see more attentive workers who care about the customers, remember the customer is always right! I wish that the management would keep an eye on the workers and remind them more often to use their best customer service skills. :-)"
0,"We arrived at the hotel, and the wait was not bad to check in. We got up to the room and it was disgusting. The glasses had lipstick stains, and the bathroom wall was disgusting. We immediately went downstairs and the receptionist told us that they didn't have any rooms. So we asked her to at least send someone up to clean the room, and she went and talked to a manager. TADA! A new room magically opened up. This room wasn't much cleaner, but at least the glasses were cleaned and we have a remote control. We got comped a Buffett, but really it doesn't make up for the disgusting rooms and the mediocre service. We will stay elsewhere next time. Disgusted."
0,Probably would have been good but the 10 minute wait in the drive thru with no cars ahead of me was ridiculous. I don't know what I was waiting for considering my burger was still moo-ing even though I ordered it well-done. Gross. Not going back.
0,"I ordered the Salmon with Gorgonzola Sauce for take out. I notice the bill and they've charged $1 for \""to go\"". WHAT THE HELL! I've NEVER heard of anyone charging extra for a pick-up order. Even if it's a delivery, I can understand an extra charge. What was even more annoying was that the packaging was lousy, cheap Styrofoam!! Not even worth a dollar.\nNow for the entree itself. The cook (notice my use of the word cook, not chef) had to be blind. That's the only way the fish could have been so overcooked. It was like a hockey puck. DRY and BLACK. The menu claims that the entree has mushrooms and asparagus in it. Again, the blind cook probably just put double the amount of mushrooms instead. For a pricey $22, this was the worst entree I have had in Charlotte. Two thumbs down."
0,"Quit going after two years here. Female manger is beyond rude. You may notice her, she looks like the evil witch from the wizard of Oz, huge pointed nose.\n\nKept me from working out even though I was still under contract. Place is now dirty, and over crowded. Save your cash and join a gym that actually cares about its members. Call it 24 hour calculator because to them you are just another number.\nTwo stars,"
1,"Vegas isn't the best town to see bands in. mainly becuase, if its not mainstream radio, odds are we are ignored. but when a band does come, odds are it is to the Joint. I have seen many shows here, Muse, Interpol, Death Cab for Cutie, Vampire Weekend, Snow Patrol, The Beastie Boys, Wolfmother, and I could go on. Whats great is that you can always get down close to the band, without really having to push your way through people, which i wont do, but many people do anyways. This is becuase of the 3 leveled floors. But the common theme of almost all shows ive seen here has been dicks. i have seen a number of fights (at fairly peaceful bands), People are always smoking, spilling drinks, and having no regard for those around them. but thats vegas people, not the joint. so i cant knock it down for that. But the venue is clean, rarely sells out (once again, vegas music scene, not the joint), and lets you get close to really good bands."
1,"If you are a fan of Prime Rib, Crab Legs and Dessert, this is the buffet for you.\n\nI'M a BIG fan of Prime Rib, Crab Legs and Dessert, this is SO the buffet for ME! :D \n\nThe PRIME RIB\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/2weQS-RnoOBhb1KsHKyoSQ?select=jdfrkCcUITfPje_hj07FTg\nSure, I can go to a cheaper buffet with (sub)Prime Rib, but it wouldn't be as tender, juicy, melt in your mouth succulent like they have it here.  For the same price as this buffet (under $40 for dinner) I can get a nice prime rib somewhere swankier but that's all I'd get with no chance of a second or third helping.  \n\nThe CRAB LEGS\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/2weQS-RnoOBhb1KsHKyoSQ?select=aHJgbggTOloF2UFOvyP9cg\nThe snow crab legs here are sweet, delicate AND delicious even BEFORE the butter and lemon.  But what fun would it be if you didn't dunk it in butter?!  I'm typically not a fan of this type and more of a dungeness crab kind of gal, but these are outstanding.  They are even split open for you and ready for easy picking!\n\nThe DESSERTS\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/2weQS-RnoOBhb1KsHKyoSQ?select=cIYvAnaBHdm_ji688G7y-A\nTres Leches, Gelato, Chocolatey Brownies, Made to order Crepes, Key Lime tarts, Creme Brulee, Tiramisu, Warm Bread Pudding with Creme Anglaise, really....I can keep going!  And there is distinguishable quality and they are definitely a couple notches above the mass-produced type stuff at the other places - presented in pretty little serveware and you can taste taste taste to your heart's content.\n\nIMHO, these are the three core competencies that this buffet has.  OK, I admit - the sushi here is not great and might be better at the other buffets.  But does the other buffet have Truffled Pea Risotto?  Nope.  Does the other buffet have Roasted Fennel salad?  Nope.  Tom Yum soup where you can put in your own accoutrements?  Didn't think so.\n\nLucky for us we were with a buncha buffet professionals and we came for an early dinner - so there was no wait, and we split our large group into smaller tables (but still next to each other) so we would avoid the \""required\"" 18% gratuity. We tipped well anyway, our servers cleared our table and topped off our drinks often and with a smile.\n\nSo if you like the cheaper buffets with a ton of food with so-so quality, this wouldn't be for you.  But if you like to surf and turf as the way I described above and a sweet tooth that won't stop, then go to the Wynn FTW!"
0,"the food is not really good, and they do an 18% automated tip, careful!! I would not recommend this place."
1,"This place is fantastic.  Quite a surprise.  It's definitely \""asian\"" and not \""chinese\"".  Vietnamese Pho - yum.  The sushi is also very good.  Try the Godzilla, Fort Mill roll and Tega Cay roll.  Service is very attentive.  Almost too attentive - like there are 12 people working there when only half that are needed.  Perhaps the one weak spot is the drinks - they give you a can of soda not a fountain soda.  But the food is great and the people are very nice.  And it's been fairly quick too both times that I've been there."
0,"I normally love Lowes. We purchased new tile flooring, new carpet for the bedrooms and all new kitchen appliances. \n\nI'm extremely disappointed with the Door Department at the Eastern/St. Rose store. We ordered doors back in December 2013. It is now February 18, 2014. They have not arrived and will not be installed until March, I'm guessing! I don't know and apparently they don't either. Their customer service leaves a lot to be desired. You would think after spending over $5,000.00 on doors that they would give you a heads up as to what is going on. They blame it on not hearing back from the Vendor. Maybe it's time for new Vendors or better yet...don't buy your doors here ever."
0,"went for a catered wedding one sunday. the food was good and the employees that were assigned to the wedding were pleasent and helpful, however one manager ruined everything when he decided we were too noisy (this is Wisconsin we drink at weddings) and claimed that we were disturbing the business up stairs(they were dead, didn't even turn their outside lights one untill 9pm) and kicked the entire wedding party out about an hour too early. \nto review: food=meh ok for catering\nservice=alright they were nice\njackass power tripping manager who should be sacked=night destroyer"
1,"I've been going to Prestige Nails for years. Since it's come under new management, Ellen and her team, have really done a great job at putting the customer first. If I ever have had a concern... all I've had to do was let the manager, Ellen, know. She's taken care of me every time. I've also seen her go above an beyond for other customers to make them comfortable. She's even referred me to another competing salon for a facial. That's service!\n\nThe staff is friendly, clean, and skilled. The massages are the longest and most relaxing massages I've ever received during a pedicure service. I have no plans to ever go anywhere else and I tell all of my friends to stop here if they're in the area! \n\nI read some of the poor reviews and have to wonder if the disgruntled customer took the time to voice their concerns to the manager before taking to the Internet. It's amazing what voicing our concerns can do. Not only to help resolve a specific situation, but to guide employees in situations going forward."
1,The diversity of Montreal's restaurant scene is on of the things that makes it so fantastic and La Khaima contributes to that.   Being in a group we we seated in sort of booth complete with comfy pillows.  The table was a little lower herethan usual which wasn't the greatest for eating but that is my only complaint really.\n\nThe food was really good here although I can't remember the names of most of the dishes.  We had a table d'hote menu which included a variety of dishes served family style.  We also had a hibiscus-ginger drink which was very refreshing as well as mint tea which I thoroughly enjoyed.\n\nThe owner is very welcoming and does a great job of explaining the dishes to you.  He also served us the hibiscus drink according to the custom from his home country which I thought was a nice touch.  Apparently the pitcher containing the drink has to be put on the table for all the guests to see before you can serve it. Anyways definitely check this place out if you get a chance!
0,this place does not deserve any stars. i had to put one star in order for this review to get posted.\n\nplease beware of door pushers in this hotel!!!\n\nif you decide to stay at this hotel make sure your doors are closed all the way & all your belongings are stored & locked away!! \n\nworse customer service ever!! it's not worth it to stay at hotel where you don't feel safe. please please please do not trust this hotel. you can find better hotels with better security.
1,"People are too hard on Zine.\n\nFirst, Palazzo often times gives you a good amount off your meal if you're staying there.  Secondly, it's Vegas -- NOTHING IS AUTHENTIC. \n\nA little on the expensive side but the atmosphere is fantastic  and the service is pretty good. Just drink a little before dinner and enjoy yourself.\n\nThe food is all pretty good. I've only had a handful of items on the menu (roughly 5-10) but honestly was never disappointed. Of course it wasn't the best food in the world, but honestly it still is pretty damn good. \n\nThe star is taken off for the prices. Yes, I know I mentioned you can get a good amount off but there is no reason to charge me almost 20 bucks for a bowl of pho. Seriously, no reason at all. That being said, I will go back and get the pho next time I'm there. Damn.\n\nBut seriously, you are eating a restaurant in a 5-star resort -- things are going to be overpriced. There is a Panda Express somewhere on the strip, if you don't want to pay for the experience."
0,"So, first off. If you are going to call it happy hour, don't just take 30 percent of the food off the plate and give me a 30 percent discount. that's horse shit.   \n$3.50 coors light  on happy hour? FU, coors light should probably not be 3.50 ever. thats a rip.\n\n\n\nLindsay, Lauren??? I dont know, brown haired girl behind bar. You have to be a TON hotter/friendly to give this bad of service and get away with it. I thought it was weird that my beer was empty for so long, so I went to take a piss and noticed it wasnt a special treat for me, everyone had empty beers. \n\n\nWhile I was in the pisser I thought to myself, \""self, this looks like a pisser in a frat house\"" \n\nSO, I left."
1,"Really flippin' good salads here. The first time we came for lunch: \nI read the description of Sophie's chopped salad and wanted it, eyed a pretty salad that ended up being it, ordered it and enjoyed every bite. \nBf had the Sixteen Spice Chicken Salad that was also delicious. Our company who came late ended up getting the same thing since it was so good. \n\nWe also came for weekend dinner.  As far as appetizers, the Lobster Tacos were filled with soft, delicious chopped lobster complimented by the crisp of the shell. The Blue Corn Pancakes with duck are very similar to a Chinese duck wrap dish, with a very rich flavor. For the main entree you can't go wrong with the lamb, pork chops, or the salmon... all were perfectly cooked and delicious. The tamales that come with the lamb and pork are a bit atypical, with a more ground up consistency than your normal formed tamale- the Sweet Pototo and the Plantain flavors were unique. \n\nBread basket was really unique: jalapeno corn bread (amaaazzing), walnut bread, asiago bun (drool).\n\nFriendly service, definitely on the slower side for weekend dinner (from ordering to food arrival was ~45 minutes."
1,"Alright folks, I must confess first before you read my review of this place. I was about 3 sheets to the wind by the time I arrived here last night. We Pre-gamed at First Friday and moved on to Fremont where we commenced the super bowl of drinking. Okay so now onto my distorted view of this place. \n\nWe had just walked away from the million dollar stack at binions and happen to see a sign that said $10 for a one topping large pizza and a 62oz pitcher of beer.  Can you repeat after me. \""SAY WHAT!!!!\""\n\nThe four of us walked in carrying our 2nd round of 52oz footballs in with us and ordered the special x 2. You know how it works, when your drunk you always seem a little hungrier than you really are. The waitress was awesome and put up with us with ease, even after a friend that was with me fumbled his football and made a huge mess. \n\nThe atmosphere is summed up in one word \""Bar\"".  \n\nI was expecting a red baron frozen pizza from smiths or something but I have to admit, even after drowning my taste buds in suds for the past 3 hours they sobered up and handled the great pizza like a pro. \n\nIf you are at Fremont and need to get some food and would like some beer this is the place to get it for cheap. I only took away a star for caution. My judgment may be off a little due to the beer. So don't hold me to it being amazing but definitely try it!!"
1,"Went here a few nights ago with a party of 4.  We just missed the dinner rush and had the place all to ourselves.  There are tons of reviews on here that pretty much cover everything, but here are some points to consider:\n\n* Water is served in plastic cups\n* Soda comes from the can so there are no refills ($3 for a can!)\n* The bread is 'eh and costs you $3\n* the bruschetta is just ok\n* The fresh mozzarella is awesome\n* The pasta is fresh and delicious\n* The tiramisu is fresh, fluffy, creamy and delicious\n\nThe best part about this place is the owner, Richard Bock.  Although he jokes around and is super friendly, you can tell he knows what he is doing when it comes to his food and his restaurant.  From the prices he charges to the way he pushes the higher priced menu items, you can tell he is a sucker for the bottom line.\n\nI admit I am one of those people who is all into going to places featured on TV, especially DDD so this place was on my list.  It didn't hurt either that there was a 50% off certificate on Local Dines ( http://bit.ly/dfR4eQ ).\n\nI'm not going to rush back because the place is pretty far from home, but if I am in the area and craving some almost homemade Italian, I will be sure to stop in again."
0,"Highly anticipated (by me), rather disappointed in execution.\n\nI need to stop falling for the chicken croquettes! They are NOT the same as what you get in Spain.  Bland and not cheezy.  They were identical to the ones I had at Bazaar in LA.\n\nThe best dish was their risotto with mushrooms and manchego.  The calamari dish (small whole squid) was juicy and tender.\n\nThe deconstructed seafood stew, lobster skewers with pinapple and the coco chorizo were all severely disappointing - really unmemorable, boring items."

1,Michael Dennis and his team have always been extremely helpful and professionl when I have pool problems I can't solve myself.  I can always count on X-Pools to go the extra mile to get things done!
1,So my boyfriend and I enter and the hostess takes us to a table because there are no booths but it was too cold for me and my bf so she said where ever we would like I sat by the sun for warmth but then I saw a booth became open we moved. In the bathroom its very nice it was messy and very cold also the mechanism sensor of the water flow didn't work very well and the machine where you have to manually take the napkins out. Didn't work so I came out asking for napkins of course they were very apologetic we sat at a booth with Tammie when she came over there were no menus nor was the table clean because we have moved but they quickly set it up . Tammie was amazing had a great smile always and tried to upgrade us but in a casual way where I didn't feel pressure we asked her opinion on dessert and she gave it to us.she asked us for refills and was very on top of her service. Definitely would come back for the service we love TGIF and it's a routine for us .My bf and I have never been to this one and we will be coming back. the only downfall...the bathrooms:( boo
1,"Like many Smith's this is an upbeat and clean supermarket with a vast selection. This supermarket has been here for ages, and it does not show it. Overall it is a nice shopping experience."
1,A lot of history has taken place here. Even if you don't stay here touring the property is a must!
1,"I've eaten many a bowls of pho in my lifetime, and have been to most of the Vietnamese restaurants in Charlotte. I would say this place is pretty decent, although not spectacular. Compared to phos of other Vietnamese restaurants in Charlotte it tastes very similar. I think the one thing that stands out about this place is that they have buffet on the weekends. I have never gotten the buffet but plenty of people do. They do get very busy on the weekends and that speaks well for the restaurant. A lot of asians frequent this restaurant and that also goes to show that they have some pretty authentic food. \n\nAs for the pho, I would say the broth is decent. I haven't really  They used to put more meat in their bowl, but as it has been with most restaurants recently, everyone is putting less and less ingredients in their dishes. Must be the economy. They do give plenty of sides (bean sprouts, basil, peppers, lime) unlike some other restaurants. Their semi-raw steak is very thinly sliced, which is good for both the restaurant and myself.\n\nI'm pretty sure they put a good bit of MSG in their broth though because I get the after effects of it (drowsiness, dry throat). Although, that's not a deal breaker for me since it makes the food taste better. Just have to drink plenty of water if you plan on drinking the broth.\n\nSomething about the service at this restaurant. This is really strange. Apparently they don't have waiters working in sections, their waiters work the entire restaurant. So we had a lot of overlapping service which became extremely annoying the course of the meal went on. We had a waiter come up to us to ask for our drinks. We told him. 3 minutes later, another waiter came up to take our drink orders. Same thing happened with our food order. It was funny at first. Then one waiter kept asking my friend if she would like to have bubble tea. My friend told the waiter no, and he asked her, really? Are you sure? So my friend, being nice, told the waiter that she would think about it and order it if she wanted it. Another \""Sure?\"" Yes, she was definitely sure now that she didn't want a bubble tea. During the course of the meal 3 different waiters stopped by multiple times to ask us how the meal was, but we were very engaged in our conversation so it got pretty annoying. On its face you might consider this good service, but I would call it disorganized service. \n\nStill the food is good enough, and the location in close proximity enough to me that I will still go eat at this restaurant once a month. So I'll give it a low 4 star."
0,"On the whole, this restaurant does give a new patron a great slice of  European cuisine and it is worth noting that if you've never been here before that you should try it out because most of the food as it is now is delicious, but having been here in the past and knowing what these foods really were has really soured my experience.\n\nIt's been a long time since I had been back to this place since its first inception. Back then this place was one of the only occupied storefronts in a dead strip mall. This place had a menu that was meat and cheese heavy and showcased a wide assortment of Eastern Bloc varieties.\n\nThe appeal of this place in addition to the great food was the tell tale sign of a great hole in the wall joint: Authentic European food, sketchy European groups of men and women engaging in non-English conversation and a woman running the show who knew what was good and made sure you ate it.\n\nThe most notable things were:\n\nShopska salad\n-It has the creamiest Bulgarian feta cheese. Don't mistake this feta for Greek feta. This is incredible.\n\nCevape\n-Homemade fat finger sized sausages served with lepina, a type of yeasty flatbread.\n\nArtisian Charcuterie Plate/Cheese Plate\n-These 2 are definite musts for light eating and drinks\n\nLeskovacka pljeskavica\n-similar to the cevape in flavor but served like an over sized burger\n\nThere were also a few kabob-like meats and a few other sausages similar to the cevape that were so delicious.\n\nSo why the poor rating? Mostly due to the fact that what I described is what I was hoping to find on this most recent visit today.\n\nOur waiter informed us that he was brand new and didn't know much of the menu or the wine selection. He also pointed out on each trip back to our table that nobody was assisting him as he was learning. I'll point out here that for whatever reason he was not our waiter by the end of our meal.\n\nWe got the Beef Stroganoff Ragu, Thracian Clay Pot, Chicken Soup, Chebureki, Bacon wrapped dates and the Beef and Lamb Confit. We were really interested in the Thracian Clay Pot as it was recently featured on a Food Network show.\n\nThe Stroganoff was ladled over wild mushroom plemeni, a kind of Russian tortellini. This stroganoff had a lot of creamy goodness but was completely lacking the meat.\n\nI'll get to the Thracian Clay Pot shortly. The Chicken Soup was desired by my kids ages 8 and 6, as well as the bacon wrapped dates. The chicken soup was quite chunky with big chicken flavor. The first round of dates looked like they spent about 1 minute too long in the pan where one side was cooked good the other burnt. We were informed that the cook likes to cook it that way to which our reply was, \""Please give us unburned bacon wrapped dates.\"" They were very good about getting this order back after the rest of our items had come out.\n\nThe Chebureki was akin to a samosa where it is a flattened dough item filled with something and deep fried in this case, a delicious meat filling and topped with some dill and chopped scallions. Fairly standard in flavor and not served with any type of dipping sauce.\n\nThe Beef and Lamb Confit was tender and tasty served atop a small scoop of a dill and scallion rice. While this was tasty it was not a distinct one. My son said, \""Is this corned beef?\"" And you know what? He was right. It did taste a lot like the type of corned beef I'd find in a chunky hash at Hash House a go-go. But that's for another review.\n\nSo now back to the Thracian Clay Pot. It would seem that during the shuffling of waiters for our table, either our waiter put in this order incorrectly or it was given to another table because we didn't get it during the course of them bringing the rest of our order. When we questioned why the long wait, we were told that it takes a while. We didn't get it after an hour after initially ordering and 30 minutes after reordering it. So I can't tell you how melty and delicious it looked and how it would taste, but the table next to us seemed to really enjoy it.\n\nI'm not a vodka drinker so please read the other ratings for their extensive vodka menu.\n\nThis still doesn't really warrant the low rating based on the food. Where it really lacked was the overall experience now versus where it was. This place used to have people who knew the food, wasn't afraid to give locals some food they couldn't pronounce and keep true to themselves. Now, there are waitstaff that don't know the product and don't make you feel excited about their food.\n\nIf your looking for something new in Vegas and haven't been, your experience will most likely be 4-5 stars. It is not something that you will find anywhere else and that makes it unique. You will not have the displeasure of seeing a restaurant jump the shark."
1,"Only fresh brew cup in the Phoenix West Valley.  I do not live as close to Ground Control Coffee Shop as I used to, but still worth the drive.  If you are a coffee drinker you will agree that fresh roast and fresh brew is amazing.  \n\nI also like there huge selection of beers from around the world.

1,Great little diner with good breakfast. Pancakes were off the hook and took up the whole plate. Coffee cups were huge and toast was as thick as french toast. Overall very good spot that is mostly filled with locals. Only reason I gave 4 stars is because the booths are a little snug.
1,"I went for breakfast. It was the best buffet of my trip. I think the Rio buffet might beat it (from another trip years ago), but it handily surpassed the Parisian Village, the Mirage Wicked Spoon, and Mandalay Bay's buffet from this particular Vegas jaunt.\n\nThe Wynn's decor was lovely, but the food was the star. My breakfast had a lot of variety and included more expensive items like seafood and lox. There was both fresh and dried fruit. I think there was a seafood omelet in addition to the omelet station. I had lox-topped pizza. There was probably other stuff but I was too busy with the fish. \n\nThe real awesomeness was in the dessert. Yes, I ate dessert. For breakfast.\n \nAnd I even ate it first.\n\nBless their hearts, the Wynn staff had out a full dessert spread at 9 AM. Tres leche in a shot glass, lemon meringue pie, little cakes (regular and sugar-free), pastries, eclairs.  \n\nI really love dessert. And a good dessert puts me in my happy place. This is when I close my eyes and let the flavor fill my mouth and pretty much make sweet love to my spoon, one slow bite at a time. It is sweet, creamy nirvana.\n\nI did that in the Wynn. There was a French couple seated next to me, and the male half of the couple kept looking over at me, wondering what I could possibly be eating that was so good. \n\nNo other dessert in all of Vegas put me in my happy place. The Wynn breakfast made my day, and it might have made the day of the gentleman next to me, so it gets five stars."
1,"Having already visited the Home Hardware store in Morningside, I was expecting to find more of the same at their sister store in Portobello.  I was pleasantly surprised to see that this store offers much of the same and more.\n\nFirstly, this place is very large.  I just about managed to fit it all into the photo!  It covers everything that you could possibly need for your home.  There's paint, DIY equipment, plants, home accessories and furnishings and more besides.  They also provide a delivery service, meaning that there's no need to trek out to a B&Q or Homebase, when a place as big as this is probably just on your doorstep.\n\nHonestly, I was impressed with this place.  It crams in a lot of stuff, and will succeed in dragging people away from the big chains to something more local.  These people are definitely getting it right in my opinion."
1,"I'm very impressed with Topaz Veterinary Clinic, particularly Dr. Berthiaume. I manage a Doggie Daycare and boarding facility in Scottsdale and we have a daycare pup that's been coming for daycare. He recently had a mass removal at Topaz Veterinary Clinic. I noticed the incision was slightly irritated and called Topaz Veterinary Clinic to inquire about his history so I may transport him to a closer clinic. Dr. Berthiaume, ended up calling me back and immediately drove to our facility so that he may treat the patient himself. He wasn't only pleasant and friendly, he also seemed to be very knowledgeable to the background of the patient as well as his siblings. It's not always easy to find a Veterinarian who genuinely cares. I would definitely recommend!"
0,So I decided to order food from them for lunch for myself and a coworker. The ordering was easy enough and I was told it would be here by 1215 ordered at 1140am... I though sure not a problem... It got here at 1230... After I called to ask what was taking so long. No apologies or nothing... If you say your going to be here at a specific time show up promptly! It's my lunch hour! It was shortened thanks to you and your employees who don't give a damn. 23 bucks for 2 half sandwiches and small salads after tip.. Shoulda ordered something good for this price. I got the turkey sandwich  and it was rather forgettable. I don't think I will be ordering from this establishment again. Shoulda just got in n out.
1,"This place is great. Not because I use to work there many years ago, but because this place has great prices and and great service. Matinees are $4.50 and Evening shows are $6.50. People prefer the other newer theaters but your paying a whole lot more. The one thing thats a bummer is that they are finally banning people brining in their own food and snacks. Back when I was working there until a year ago, they finally started cracking down. Thats what was great and seperated this theater from all the others. This place has 12 theaters. Its called Cinedome but only 2 theaters are actually domed lol. They upgraded the seating and painted some vibrant colors inside is about the only difference they have done since it opened during the mid 90's. It is outdated but they run first run movies and actually have a couple 3D screens as well. The snack bar is clean and they actually still have a bulk candy bin. I say if you want to watch first run movies at a great price and not as packed as the big places, this is the place. Until next time!!!"
1,Great food lots of portion!
1,"The wait for this place is really long, but I already knew that from the reviews. We went to eat at about 10:45 PM and it took us about 1-1/2 to 2 hours to get seated. I've eaten here before but it was many years ago and I have been wanting to eat the clam linguine from here for a while. When we were finally seated, I ordered the New England clam chowder and the linguine and clams with a 2 heat (spice). Mike had the New England clam chowder and the Palace Pan Roast with a 6 heat (spice). They serve a sourdough bun with your order. I really liked the bun (with butter) and asked for more. The clam chowder was good too. Of course my FAVORITE was the linguine with clams. Mike's Palace Pan Roast was also good, although I would've liked more rice to go with it. Yes, I ate some of his food too :)"
0,"Tried LaVida because I received a gift certificate for Christmas. Was scheduled with Caitlin by the potty mouth receptionist. Expressed several areas of pain/tightness. She started late, worked some areas I hadn't requested and none of the ones I did. Headache came on later int he evening. Internet research indicates it was due to not working opposing muscle groups, i.e, bad/inexperienced massage therapist.\nCan't recommend."
1,"I heard great things about the Bachi Fish Burger. So since this was my first visit here I ordered the Bachi Fish Burger with Sweet Potato Fries.  I was NOT disappointed.  The burger was huge! The bun tasted like it was freshly made, soft and moist. The fish was cooked perfectly, nice and flaky, moist and mild tasting.  The fries were served with a citrus dipping sauce which was an excellent combination.  \n\nThe service was great!"
0,"I took my wife here for lunch today. We both tried the clam chowder, which although pretty tasty,  was thin and the carrots and potato were under cooked. I tried the Alaskan Whitefish and the salt and pepper catfish fillet. Both were tasty, but there was enough oil to puddle on the bottom of my plate. I tried the onion rings and found them to be large and without much flavor.  The problem with the coleslaw is that they chop the cabbage too finely and it turns out more like a mush than a salad. The worst part was, even though the parking lot was almost empty, it took longer waiting in line to pay the bill than it did to eat the meal Would I go back? Yeah...the next time I have an overwhelming desire to listen to my arteries harden  while I ate!"
1,"My cat Pikachu ran away for six weeks and luckily my brother found him eventually. He was very dehydrated, under weight, and of course very stressed.  They worked with us to get him feeling better immediately and to figure out what other conditions he may have.  I don't make a lot of money and am very grateful to them for working with me financially while not making any shortcuts in bettering my kitty.  The doctor made time to talk to me and go over my options and the receptionists worked to make it as affordable for me as they could. I'll be forever loyal to them for being there for those who don't have a lot just as much as for those who can afford it.  I especially appreciate this being as I am a pet sitter and work at a doggie daycare as well as do rescue work on the side.  A lot of my money goes to pets."
0,"STAY AWAY FROM THIS PLACE!! You have been warned! When you are there they tell you you can cancel at anytime, you pay for first and last month plus an initiation fee. total $97... after 2 weeks i decited to go back to 24hr Fitness. I was told i cant Do that and they will keep my $97 if I cancel.  The sales team are friendly and are quick to take your credit card, come time to cancel its a huge hassle and they treat you like shit because you needed to join a gym closer to your home. The front desk people are very unprofessional, constantly on their personal phones and on one instance one of the girls was on the phone with a customer rolling her eyes like the caller was dumb and she was wasting her time. Total assholes. Stay away"
0,Visited this restaurant for the first time with my boyfriend and it was awful. The service was very unattentive and slow. We ordered an omelet and egg rolls and it took thirty minutes for our food and we were the only two in the restaurant. And let's not talk about the mixed drinks. Will never go back.
0,Oh my god; the Poutine was cold and just disgusting and the hotdog was not great either.  The cheese also was playing on its own within the dish. Do not go here - tastes very differently versus other la belle province franchises.
1,"Not sure where all of the other reviewers on this site go for sushi, but I found Shogun to be right in the middle of the road for pricing.  Cheaper than Sapporo, Ra & Ah-So but a little more expensive than your traditional mom & pop sushi.  I say if you want to be seen in your micro mini with your gel head boyfriend than head to one of the aforementioned places.  If you want good sushi in a comfortable & fun setting than I would suggest Shogun.  I have been going here for nearly 20 years, well before they bought out the other side and built the bar area.  The sushi bar is always the way to go as you can be in and out in 20 minutes.  They have a fun little patio for groups (when it's not 115 outside).  I'd much rather support this establishment that has been locally owned forever than head out to another cookie cutter sushi chain."
1,"Their coffee is delicious, however generally sweeter than Starbucks and more reasonably priced. The staff is always chipper and pleasant. I definitely recommend! They get stickers every month so ask the cashier!"
1,Been here several times now. I can definitely say I will continue to go back. My favorite is the mint chocolate chip ice cream between two chocolate chip cookies. The service is always fast and the employees are so friendly. You cannot beat the price. Two dollars? Is this real life. Thankfully it is.
1,"When ever I see the lovely tulips and beautiful array of colourful flowers, I know that spring is here.\n\nAnd that's why Allen Centennial Gardens, right by the lake, and behind Steenbock Library at UW, is SUCH a special place.  It's a little piece of heaven in the university, almost feels like you're in a magical little park.\n\nBenches, ponds, gazebo, many times you walk around and someone's getting married, and most importantly, if you take your laptop in order to study, gratis wireless for students thanks to the university!!!!!\n\n\nSeriously, even if you just want to go there, read a book and leave, it's so tranquil and pleasent..."
1,Great service and great food. Very friendly even after the volume of people they deal with on a daily basis. Pro's
1,"Der erste Eindruck von au\u00dfen ist recht unscheinbar. \nParken kann man gegen\u00fcber auf dem Parkplatz eines Zoofachhandels, hoch gehts dann entweder per Treppe oder Aufzug.\nDie Einrichtung ist absolut typisch, wie bei den meisten Asia-Restaurants.\nDie Bedienung war bei meinem ersten Besuch einigerma\u00dfen freundlich, geht besser, aber auch deutlich schlechter.\nWir kamen zum Buffet, welches aus verschiedenen Bereichen besteht. Einmal hat man das klassische Asia Buffet mit einer Vorsuppe, Reis, Fisch, Fleisch, verschiedenen Saucen, Fr\u00fchlingsrollen, gebackenen Wantan, Spie\u00dfen, Gem\u00fcsen, gebratenen Nudeln, gebratenem Reis, Thai-Curry, einmal quer durch Asien alles was man so kennt und mag.\nEine kleine Auswahl Sushi steht auch zur Verf\u00fcgung.\nIm anderen Teil gibt es rohe Fisch (Rotbarsch, Krabben, Tintenfisch, Lachs) und Fleischsorten, welche man mit verschiedenen Gem\u00fcsen und Saucen auf einem Grill frisch zubereiten lassen kann.\nDes weiteren gibt es ein kleines Salatbuffet und die \u00fcblichen Desserts wie gebackene Banane, Eis, aber auch Kuchen/Tortenst\u00fccke und ein paar andere Sachen.\nAlles in allem keine \u00dcberraschungen, aber alles gut, hei\u00df und schmackhaft.\nDas alles f\u00fcr 14,80Euro, da kann man nicht meckern.\n\nDie Toiletten sind sauber und gut begehbar, ob man allerdings mit einem Rollstuhl bis in die Toilettenkabine kommt, da bin ich nicht sicher. \nAn sich w\u00fcrde ich es aber als behindertengerecht und barrierefrei bezeichnen.\nAls dicker Mensch hat man hier auch genug Platz, es wird auch gern ein Tisch etwas verr\u00fcckt, um den Platz zu schaffen.\n\nDrau\u00dfen sitzen kann man auch, hier w\u00e4re ich aber etwas vorsichtiger und w\u00fcrde um einen Stuhl von drinnen bitten, da die Bestuhlung aus den allseits beliebten, aber unstabilen Monobl\u00f6cken besteht.\n\nDas Lokal hat keinen Ruhetag, Kartenzahlung ist problemlos m\u00f6glich.\n\nWir kommen gerne wieder!"
0,"I've been going to this Albertsons since it opened, mostly because it's only a block from my house. The checkers are nice enough, and the baggers are even more friendly. Prices are just okay, along with the selection.\n\nThe big issue now is they just recently REMOVED the self check out lanes! I asked the clerk what was the deal and all she said was \""we are going back to the old fashion way\"". Most places are adding self check out. If the check out times increase, I may stop going to this store.\n\nIf a grocery store can't handle self check out lanes, then they need to be out of business."
1,"Best beer selection of all the AJ's in Phoenix.  Beer manager knows the product well, and is often willing to pull up beer information on his Blackberry to give enhanced info on the beers.  Virtually all beer is refrigerated as well.\n\nWine and spirts selection is on par with the other locations.\n\nGood parking and convenient location 5 minutes off the 101."
0,"First off all you pushed through the line very quickly while they yell questions at you and continue to push you through the line.  Soup had cold and hot spots in it.  The sandwich was just ok, had better, the chocolate covered strawberry tasted like dirt, and the plain chunk of bread they give you for the soup was a waste, should of been a bread of flavor like Sourdough or Baguette.  Very disappointed.\n\nOh the ignoring signs they have on the tables that take about 90% of the table about not going to save a seat need to go."
1,"I actually agree with Deanna on all of her points:\n1. Lunch specials are an EXCELLENT deal, and they really are the cheapest sushi in Champaign Urbana... for dinner the prices are comparable with Kamakura. The atmosphere is cool, busy and bustling (if a TEENY bit cramped, but I don't mind that when I'm eating sushi for some reason...), clean, but lack of alcohol is a downer for me. The last really great thing is that they don't overcharge for appetizer dishes and soups like some other places in town. One star off because of cramped seating, dim lighting and I thought about taking another one off for not selling alcohol... but no, it's not fair!"
0,"A month ago I took my car in for a hit and run repair after a friend reassured me that this shop was decent. My insurance company recommended it and the shop originally estimated the repairs to be a three week job.Its been an entire month with minimal communication between the shop and I to the point where I have been calling and having to go through voicemails to speak to anyone. Goes to say I am very upset with the professionalism of this shop that seems to be taking their time based on the fact that they will get paid regardless of how much time I have been waiting now for panel bodywork only. I will definitely not recommend this place for anyone looking to receive their vehicle on the time appointed. Since I still have not received my car I cannot speak about the actuall bodywork but I can say that they have already cost me more money, time and effort than any other business has before. One more thing, today is christmas eve, the shop told me the car would be ready today, today I have received no calls whatsoever in regards to my car and when I went down to the place I found no one there, they must have closed early...thanks for letting me know Gerber. I will update this review once I receive my car which may go over into the next year from the looks of it."
0,"Great place to get a B-12 shots but a horrible place to use as your regular doctor. This is the kind of office that judges you instead of helps you. They do not make me feel comfortable about discussing my health concerns and even became rude when I expressed a different opinion then them.  Wasted my time and money.  \n\nI scheduled up Pap smear and medication request. When I arrived I was informed that she will hundred dollars covered one or the other but not both. They said I would have to make separate appointment to request medication. Um, why can't I handle it all in one visit?"
1,Hands down the place to go for Natural Nail expertise!
0,I've stayed here over ten to fifteen times over the past 5 years.  Sometimes for up to three weeks at a time.  But I am fed up with the nickel and diming.  \nThe last straw was the throttling of the internet down and an extra fee for higher speeds.  Is it not enough that we get charged for it in the resort fee?  \nI could barely check emails and god forbid I tried to surf two pages at the same time.  For a good connection I'd have to shell out another $8.99 per day in addition to the $25.99 resort fee.\nNo thanks.
1,"I've been to this buffett twice now (lunch and dinner) within the last couple of months and thought it was very good for the price. However, with the local discount I think I'd prefer the Carnival World buffett at the Rio which I think is very similar only with more to choose from. It was nearly two years ago since we went to the Rio so I could be wrong. I just remember the Rio had Lasanga which I thought was quite good for a buffett."
1,"Antonio's is our \""go-to\"" for delivered pizza in our area. We are Dormont dwellers and although Antonio's is in Brookline, it's close enough. \n\nWe've tried the rest, Antonio's is the one that my sweetie and I agree on. \n\nTonight we ordered a large pizza and two small orders of wings. (We were not agreeing on the flavor of wings tonight.) Both of us started with our wings tonight, and both of us raved about them. They were perfect, just perfect.\n\nOur pizza got second billing tonight, but it wasn't the pizza's fault. Actually, it was very good. The sauce has some \""tang\"" to it, the toppings are fresh and there are plenty of them. (Tonight we had Pepperoni and mushrooms...)\n\nOften we order their pasta dishes and have never been disappointed. I'm a particular fan of their baked ziti. \n\nI have to point out that their delivery drivers are part of the equation. Although the stand time quoted is 40 minutes, we consistently get our food (in the next neighborhood) within 25 minutes and often within 20. That is very impressive. Admittedly we tip the drivers well every time. \n\nSo... If you live in Brookline, Dormont or Beechview and are in the mood for some takeout, ring up Antonio's!"
1,My pregnancy has made me a chalupa fanatic!!!  I recommend ordering your drink with no ice though- sometimes they fill the entire cup with ice and then you are left super quenched!!
0,"Wow, just wow. I had the Rodizio All-You-Can-Eat Experience and I can say that my dining experience was ruined. \n\nFirst off, most of the meats were bland and dry. Now I  finally understand why Gordon Ramsay would take a bite out of a terrible meal and not really eat anymore after that.  He was not being a jerk like some people make him out to be. I too, would be upset if I was fed an injustice done to food. I would rather starve instead of continuing eating terrible food. I just lost my appetite. It was like a punch to the face and I dislocated my jaw. I couldn't stand chewing through their meats. All the meats were basically bunched up in the same spot and seems as if it was cooked on a timer. No attention or care for the meats at all. It does not make sense to me that different meats would be cooked in the same way.\n\nI would say the service is between terrible to mediocre. What confused me during my dining experience though is that one of the servers denied my group a slice of meat because it seems that these servers are assigned tables and that table only. I just wanted my meat! Not only that, but the wait between getting the meats were long. If the meat were decent enough, then I would be staring at an empty plate most of the time. Of course, this wasn't the case since I just couldn't stomach most of the meats after a bite so I just left it to sit on my plate. I feel bad for wasting meat, but it was just that bad.\n\nI had mostly the flank steak and there was no consistency. The first few cuts were medium rare and then towards the end it was extremely rare. The only consistency though was the dryness of the meat. It was so dry that there were no signs of blood anywhere even though the piece was extremely rare. What kind of technique would you have to use to be able to obtain this result? I also had the pineapple, which I was hoping to be a saving grace to add some flavor to the meats, but it was too sweet for my palate and the charred parts tasted like burned marshmallows.\n\nIn terms of the Bazilian experience, it was so so. They start you off with pao de quijo and chips. The pao de quijo was absolutely wrong. it was more like a piece of bread if anything. Next was the rice, beans, and sweet plantain, then the salad. I didn't really go for the appetizers since I wanted the meat experience, but my companion did say he enjoyed the beans.\n\nOverall, I spent almost $60 for the meal, tax, and tip (even with a discount!) and I felt I did not get the experience that I paid for. I do not recommend Samba at all, especially if you are a meat eater. I would not even come back even if they managed to improve on the food and service."
0,"I'm not sure if it was a off night but I had very high hopes for this place, according to the reviews. \n\nWe were about a party of 20 and while I didn't have to pay for the food, I was extremely disappointed. The server was very rude, she seemed like she'd rather be somewhere else. She didn't come around again for more drink refills and the food was cold.\n\nI tried the chicken parm, which tasted old and it was cold. Also a rigatoni that was so over cooked. I was there from 6-8pm and there were only about 2 or 3 tables occupied. That says it all."
1,Whenever I need a dose of Hawaii I can always come here and stock up on all the yummy treats I used to enjoy when I lived there.\nI was just there recently for some wine and of course chocolate covered mac nuts. I had to buy a bag of the sea salted ones a well.\nOh..cant walk past the guava jelly without grabbing that as well!\nThese stores are everywhere in Hawaii and I am glad there are a few here.
0,"Went to get takeout last night, we live very close so was shocked to find food cold, not lukewarm but COLD and garlic knots were old stale and hard, salad was hardly worth it, not happy at all, for something that a business like this should be able to do very easy, they failed.\n\nWe have eaten there a few times, I can honestly say, NEVER AGAIN!"
0,"Rude Staff, no customer service. An immediate Resort fee of $15 a day, and lots of hidden charges and some fraudulent charges, that are difficult to fight after you return home. \nWe were a mixed group of 20-40 year old, and ready for a party hotel. \nNOT !!\nThey also have goons at the elevator that actually open up and search your luggage to make sure your not bringing any outside food or drink to your room.  bringing in your own licqour or beer/wine is out of the question.\nsome of our companion were taken to a back room to have thier luggage and patted down, even though we were in business attire.\nOur friend who is a CEO (40+), had his luggage broken into and searched, and they blamed it on him.\n\nThe upscale resteraunts are poor service, and long wait for food.  \nWe were treated poorly almost everywhere at the Hard Rock, We were searched again just going from our room to the pool, they actually patted us down, even though we were wearing shorts. Its more intrusive than security at the airport. \nCosts of food and drinks at the pool is very Expensive. drinks start at $18, \na six ounce bottle of water was $6, and you cant bring your own, even if its purchased in the hotel store.\n\nthe rooms are beautiful, but they seem to be having some maintenence issues, (TV and Electrical ) and problem getting cleaning staff, our room ran out of toilet paper and after a entire day, couldnt get more, we actually had to ask some other guests to get some. \n\nThe security staff at the concerts and venues are obtrusive and beligerant, we had staff trying to make dates with our wives and girlfriends, and after being rebuked, the girls were told they couldnt wear their outfits at the venue becuase they were too revealing, but thier dress hadnt been the 1/2 hour before they wouldnt date the staff. and were the same dress all the girls wear in vegas. \nThe manager had to come over and finally tell the 2 security staff that we were fine and to let us alone."
0,"This place was good until it was well known in the asian community. You have to fight for a parking spot. It's waay crowded, the employees have somewhat of a lack of communication.\n\nThe positives of this place, it reminds me of home...the palenke (however you spell it) smell. The fish you can inspect yourself for freshness (I am picky when it comes to fish). Also I like the fact they can clean and cook it for you (for those who are always on the run)."
1,"Dumplings galore!!! This tiny Chinatown joint serves up Montreal's best dumplings. They come either boiled or pan-fried, with pork, beef, lamb and seafood offerings. A variety of secondary ingredients are offered with each one and as well as vegetarian choices. I love the pork, oyster and pickled Chinese cabbage and it is the best when pan-fried. Really brings out the flavoring of the oyster. \n\nI also tried the pork, leek and egg dumpling and that I would recommend as well.\n\nI only wish they served tea here."
0,"They get one bonus star for having a cool concept and the truck is pretty awesome. Pizza was bland and that's being nice. My girlfriend wanted to try a slice at First Friday... I wasn't very interested but tried a bite of hers. She had a slice of pepperoni pizza and I'm not sure if we just got a bad slice or if they were having an off night but the pizza was dry, lacked any flavor and was caked with flour or whatever they use on the bottom of the pie. I love pizza of all types, shapes and sizes but this was pretty sad. I would have to be a pretty heavy liquid influence to make it though a slice. \nI really don't like judging places off one visit so harshly but this was pretty inexcusable. I hope they can right the ship because it is a really cool truck."
1,"Tried this place out today and omg it's so yummy that I had to write a review!!! I ordered the chicken gyro combo that came with fries and a drink for $8.50 after tax. I asked the owner what a certain dessert was that was sitting in the pan on the counter and he gave me a piece for free! Very friendly workers. Now back to the food...let's just say, I got it to go and when I got home I was barely able to eat it because my family devoured it!!! I took one bite and was moaning because it was so delicious, and my sisters and parents came into the kitchen to check out what I was eating and asked to try it... Then they just kept taking more and more of my food cause it was sooo good! Now they owe me. Lol so the fries are seasoned to perfection, the chicken is marinated and juicy topped with fresh tomatoes, onions, lettuce and tahini sauce on a pita....nom nom I'm getting hungry just talking about it!!!"
1,Getting back into wine isn't easy after a year of deployment. It's amazing how much you can forget over that time when you don't drink wines from the end cap at Pick n' Save.  I happened to be walking by this place and stopped in for a peek.  What a fortunate occurrence. \n\nAndrea has compiled a selection of wines that could match what I put on my wine lists in previous occupations. It's a great line of well-made wines from solid producers at very reasonable prices. \n\nThe selection goes from easy on the pocket bottles at $12 on up to crest just over $120.  She also holds tastings on Friday evenings for $15.  Here's to hoping she'll be a mainstay on the Cap Square for a long time to come.
1,"This well may become one of our favorite hotel in Vegas,it is about 6 to7  miles south of the strip,this place is huge we check in less then 5mins. and the front staff all were so friendly and helpful service with a smile,our room was very nice and clean from the carpet,the bed,and the bathroom,we had an amazing view of the pool and interstate 15 from the 15th floor.There is a equestrian and event center with 4,400 seats in the arena, over 2,300 slots, 60 table games, 600 seats in the bingo room, a poker room, 64 lane bowling center, 16 movie theaters, theater showroom and live entrainment lounge, 8 restaurants, pool and fitness center, costa del sur spa and salon, 6 bars and lounges and a tequila bar, a spacious race and book area, you also get a fun book which we did not used but we can use it if we do not stay here any more up until 12/13."
1,"Went for the free \""Movies in the Park Free Family Movie Series\"" last night and really enjoyed myself. The park has a giant inflatable movie screen where they show family movies every Friday night at 7 in the early spring months. \n\nGet there early to get a spot closer to the screen and bring a picnic blanket to relax on. It got a little chilly later in the evening, I would bring a blanket to snuggle under too."
1,"This place is excellent. Jason was extremely helpful and polite on the phone. I only spent about thirty minutes there for them to check my tire. I was anticipating having to purchase a new tire but I paid nothing. They fixed the leak and I was good to go. By interacting with and seeing the staff, they seem to genuinely care about efficiency and customer service."
1,Baked Potatoes are saving me from an early fast food grave.\n\nMr Hot Potato have more fillings than you can imagine (some extremely questionable... pineapple?) but rest assured you'll be catered for however you like it. As Stephanie says it rarely costs you more than a fiver for a good wholesome meal that won't leave you bloated or hungry!
0,"The Tailor I used to go to had to go out of business due to health issues so I have been in search of a new one.  This lady was recommended by one of my friends because she said that she does good work.  I have 3 clothing items that need very small fixings so I decided to take them in to this lady on Miller and Camelback.  \n\nI walk in and the place smells like an older lady that hasn't showered.  Then I walk up to the counter and the lady just stares at me.  I put my items on the counter and asked her how much it would cost to have her re-hem one pant leg of some work pants, she says \""$17.50\"".  I looked at her and said \""for one pant leg?\"" and she says yes.  I then tell her that I think that is pretty expensive considering the tailor I used to go to charged maybe $7.  She leaned back in her chair and said \""you aren't one of my customers\"" in her stupid accent.  So basically she told me if I am not willing to pay $17.50 for her to re-hem one leg of my pants that she doesn't want me as her customer.\n\nHow is this lady staying in business?? First of all the smell of the place would deter me from leaving my clothes in there anyway because I know I would pick them up and they would smell like her which would be a no-no.  Worst business lady ever!!"
0,"I fly a lot.  And I used to not mind flying on Delta, despite the fact that their flights rarely take off on time and seem to always be overbooked and have flight attendants who would never win Miss Congeniality.  And other than MSP and a few newer shared terminals, the Delta terminals are overcrowded crap.  But then to add insult to injury, they changed their partnership rules with other carriers.  Now I pay for a bag to avoid checking at the gate or having somebody crush my stuff with their overly large \""carry-on.\""  No SKY privileges anymore.  I know, I know...that seems really whiny; but when somebody takes it away suddenly...man, it stings.  So why would I choose this airline when I can have an equally poor experience from another airline for a cheaper price, or a better flight for the same price?  The obvious answer is, I wouldn't."
0,"I am not embarrassed to say I LOVE buffets. I am, however, embarrassed to write the review of this one.  I saw this buffet on a few top ten lists, all of which praised it for being far more affordable than the other top-notch Vegas buffets.  \nMy experience was laughably bad.\nFirst, it's only $10 cheaper than some of the best buffets in Vegas (Bellagio may be my fave) at $27, and the experience is night and day.\nMuch of the food was mislabeled or had no name cards at all, and when I'd mention that fact to the cooks behind the counter, they literally shrugged.  I asked to move to a table near an outlet so I could charge my phone, and the waiter told me \""no one will help you there\"", so I sat 15 feet from where they sat me... He walked past me 10 times and never got me a drink or said another word to me.\nThe food was just OK. Not as big a selection as the Rio or Wynn, and while I'm not big on shellfish and sea food, I'd say that was the strength of this buffet. The dessert selection was huge, but much lower-quality than any of the top-notch buffets.\nI ended up eating a make-your-own fajita, which is a bad sign. There are so many better choices, avoid this one."
0,"I am new to Las Vegas and am looking for a primary care physician.  I had heard good things about Dr. Pingol so I made an appointment.  I was told to be at the office 15 minutes early for my appointment so I could fill out my paperwork.  I arrived early and waited for 50 minutes during which time I started reading online reviews stating that it was normal to wait one to two hours for your appointment.  \nDr. Pingol may be a fine doctor; however, in my opinion it is very inconsiderate to schedule someone and then let them sit waiting for an hour or more without any attempt to explain.  I got the feeling this is standard practice in Dr. Pingols office.  \nI left and won't be going back.  I would select one star but I did not get to see Dr. Pingol, so my rating is based off the office staff / efficiency alone."
1,"Restaurant/brewery in an old church you say? I'm intrigued.\n\nChurch Brew Works gives you some really good food in a cool atmosphere. I'm not a drinker so I can't report on the brews. Had a pasta dish with shrimp. It was very good. I think all of us really liked our dishes except for maybe the couscous salad. Didn't try the pizza but some of those looked really good.\n\nWe had to wait about 30-45 minutes for a seat but in part because we didn't mind waiting and didn't feel like hovering in the half of the restaurant with open seating. They take reservations for groups of 8 or larger. Prices are a little on the higher end, but so is the food. Main dishes are in the 15-25 range but they are filling and taste great. Good, knowledgeable servers.\n\nMy only real complaint, the very poorly marked front entrance. FYI, it is the center door at the front of the church, which seems logical but when you are there, it is not easy to tell."

0,"Meh. I wouldn't say we got a deal on the two rooms I booked - two rooms for two nights cost over $325 total, and I had to cough up another $312 when I checked in for these two rooms ($100 per room deposit - even though I used a major credit card? And $28 per room per night resort fee). Granted, I got the $200 back when I checked out but still. This was the weekend after Christmas. The gentleman who checked us in was very nice and helpful. Like the other have said, check in at 4pm, the line is LONG. They used to have check In kiosks, not anymore. The rooms were basic. Like others said, paint chipping off the walls. In my brothers room a piece of the headboard had broken off before they got to the room and the appropriate solution was to just prop it against the wall. \nThought we would give it a try since we allegedly had gotten \""Black Friday\"" deals on our rooms. Think we may stick with our tried and true next time."
1,"Looks like a waffle house, smells like a waffle house.. feels like I'm back home in SC! \nHe had the diner stack, biscuit on the bottom, eggs scrambled. I had 2 eggs over medium with bacon, hashbrowns, and toast. We were the only customers on a Sunday morning at 1pm until the hungover undergrads rolled in. Service was excellent. Our waitress was very friendly, and our food arrived promptly. It was delicious and didn't leave me with that greasy what did I just put in my stomach feeling that I was expecting (from past WH experiences). I will definitely come back. The only thing that could have made my experience better is a big bowl of cheese grits..."
0,"The food was good - brisket and ribs and a black bean soup. We had a chili cheese pepper thing that was delicious but was tiny for $10. I had a good sangria too but it is over priced for BBQ,  and never had Mexican BBQ so i felt the favors didn't go that well together. We had one appetizer and split an dinner dish, and I had one sangria. The bill was over $50 with tip and no left overs.\n\nService was great, but due to pricing, we will not be back."
1,"My daughter introduced me to her favorite pizza place last night.  Many thanks!  We ordered by phone and it was ready for pickup when promised.  The toppings were exactly as we requested and the folks there were cheerful and friendly.  When we got it home and dug in, it was everything she told me it would be.  Very fresh and tasty and NOT smothered in garlic.  Some places seem to think it's ok to let garlic overpower all the other ingredients, but not Russo's.  Thanks for the great pizza!  I'll be back for more."
1,"Great food and great vibe. The staff is very trendy, but also knowledgeable. The Mac n Cheese and the Gyro Tacos were probably the highlight for me. I wasn't a fan of the Cauliflower dish... It sort of tasted like grilled veggies doused in lemon juice. Overall, a great experience and I would definitely go back."
0,"i'd like to give it 0 stars! my husband & i bought 2 groupons for lots of great skin treatments at a discounted price in 11/10... i first called in april, 2011 to set up our appointments... got a voice mail saying to give them 24 hrs to call you back... then called again a week later, then again months later. never got any call back and the voice mail was always full so i couldn't leave any more message (but did leave 2 in april). we took a chance and drove to the location this month (august) to find an empty building w/ a \""for rent\"" sign posted. this is absolutely a TERRIBLE way to run a business. i am a massage therapist and i would never treat potential clients like this. we will certainly be contacting groupon for a full refund!!!!!!!! and this experience alone makes me wiry of buying anything else from them which requires an appointment."

Thank you for not rushing our enjoyment of your food and our company!"
0,"I had dinner with my wife at Spasso's a few months back and have not really been too excited to return. Maybe I just picked the wrong menu item so I'm giving Spasso's the benefit of 2 stars instead of 1 star. I had the Italian Sausage Panini for $10.95 and a soda. The Sausage was like a patty with onions and greenpeppers, and was not too appetizing. I only eat half of my sandwich."
1,"My girlfriend and I have been Shogun fans for a few years and when we can, we'll take in a few of the monster-sized rolls, some edamame and Saki and call it a night.\n\nToday I went for the lunch special and was very pleased with the portions and the price.  The Katsu chicken was crisp and not over cooked and the roll was right on target. \n\nWe usually feel like we've been well fed, well served and reasonably priced.  The fish is alway fresh, the sushi chefs always accommodating to create a special version of a standard roll and the wait staff kept our glasses filled.\n\nI read some of the other reviews and feel that over the long run, some are off base - this is my perspective from over more than a few years of being a semi-regular dinner."
0,I use to love their concert but tonight it was nothing but soup with large globs of what should have been 'mix ins'.  At over $5 a container it was very disappointing.
1,If you are a Pho-natic like I am you will really like this place.  The broth is fantastic. They cook the beef bones and herb/spice broth for nearly 24hr.  The meet is fresh and tender. Lots of noodles and friendly service. \nOne of the owners came to our table and had us try a few new things. It was refreshing to see a place the gets great reviews and stands up to its reputation.\nI would certainly visit again.
1,"Really good Pho and surprisingly good Chinese food. My daughters, who have lived half their life in Asia, were very impressed when craving some Pho during recent trip to Tempe. The family owners were very nice."
0,"went there twice in the last 2 weeks waitress just ignores me and takes customers orders that came in after me. I  then just get up and leave, they seem to care less."
0,"Apparently I'm too nice. I wrote in my last review after they drove spikes into my nice silk strapless dress that I was sure they would've taken care of it, had I gotten off my lazy ass, because they really are wonderful folks. \n\nWrong. WRONG!!!\n\nI am too nice. Period. I brought in a pair of pants that I had altered recently... taken in at the waist and replaced back buttons for a mere $23 Oh, I should mention the back buttons were missing due to Regal cleaners services. Did I ever complain then? Nope. Should I have? Yup.\n\nUpon getting these pants back, they were missing a button and had weird white stuff on them. I figured they would take care of it. I took the pants in, explained that I had just had them altered (great work at The Fit Alterations, BTW) and now they were damaged. The manager was out and I waited on the call back. \n\nI miss the call and stopped by that night only to be told that the white stuff was the fabric wearing out and that was from normal wear and tear. Um, ok. They weren't like that at all when I brought them in and now they are almost unwearable (especially because of the button flap sticking out on the ass of the pants because you took it off... yet AGAIN).\n\nNo offer was made to put the button back on... no offer of returning my money for the last cleaning of said pants. Nothing. If they'd sewn the button back on, at least I could've worn them one last time. Yes, I am that cheap, I would've worn them even with the white junk all over. Now, they are trash. Expensive trash. It's just weird that they went from fine to completely unwearable in one single visit to the cleaners. \n\nAnd that was the day that Regal lost my family's business."
1,You honestly cannot go wrong with any sandwich here. They are all delicious. I introduced my parents to this place and they are also addicted. A great spot to grab a lunch sandwich of any style. Definitely one of the better ( no pun) sandwich options in Charlotte.
1,"I would like to comment on my latest favorite beauty regime.  A few months ago, Karen @ Foxy Nails suggested I try the gel manicure.  It lasts for 3 to 4 wks and I LOVE it!  I've been getting the French gel mani.  I could never have a traditional mani look this good for 3 or 4 wks AND it's your own nails.  I've gotten so many compliments.  The only problem....now I'm hooked on getting manicures!"

0,"I had always heard that Lulu's Noodles was supposed to be good............,well I sat down w/my friend & it was like sitting in a wind tunnel.  Artic blasts of freezing cold air whooshed all around our table.  Now mind you we haven't even eaten yet!  My friend put on my down vest & I wrapped my scarf around my neck hoping to garner some warmth.  We moved to another table in the back(our waitress was very patient w/us)but incredibly it was even more frigid!!!!! All around people sat shivering in their coats.  The food was extremely MEDIOCRE.  Again our server was a sweetheart. I would never recommend this restaurant to anyone but an enemy!  By the way the Manager has no customer service skills.  I have a head cold that should it worsen, I will be blaming Lulu's Noodles!"
1,"Bobby C's is what a neighborhood pub is all about.  The fact that it serves up soul food and hosts some amazing music is icing on the cake.\n\nBut what makes the family owned and operated bar & lounge stand out is the fact that, from the minute you walk it, until you leave, you're treated like a member of their family. with in minuted we were joking and kidding around, a few minutes later, we were being given a tour of the facility, including their overflow seating next door.\n\nUntil now, it's been a hidden gem with a loyal following of people into live jazz and R&B, or this looking to sate their southern food cravings.  However, with a light rail stop outside, I predict it will be getting a whole lot more attention, (Hint: it is a must stop venue for any Light Rail pub crawls)"
0,"The spa and gym are great, this poor review is for the salon. The staff was rude and the pedicure was so not worth the $100+ they charge. Find a nail salon off the strip or get at home before you leave."
0,"Everything in this store is over priced by at least 30%.  I could have died in the garden center and still would not gotten any attention.  I walked around for about 20 minutes and passed several staff members that we talking to one another and not the customers.  Not one of them said hi, can I help you, or anything else. I did end up interrupting their conversation to ask about a plant that was not tagged.  The lady told me she did not think it was not for sale!?!? It's a plant in a pot in a garden center..  WTF?!?"
0,"First of all, a substitute sushi chef is like a substitute teacher. That was our mistake. When the relatives wanted to take us to their favorite sushi restaurant and they didn't recognize the chef, it should have been a red flag (pun intended, since the restaurant's name means \""Red Flower\"").\n\nAfter that, the reliance on \""seafood salad\"" as a filler was another sign that something was amiss. And maybe the chef is Atkins-leaning, for while the sushi fish portions were generous, the supporting rice was about half a thumb-sized. Balance, Grasshopper!\n\nEverything was fresh and the place was clean. The hot sake was in a half-litre ceramic bottle at a very reasonable price. The waiter WAS apologetic when he came back to say the menu was wrong, after having been shown the difference between what we ordered and what the chef assembled, and did take it off the bill (well, we didn't eat it).\n\nMAYBE it is ok the rest of the time. It IS an awfully long way out of town, plunked at the edge of new franchise ghettos. But the staff seemed authentic, but got too much wrong to get three stars. \n\nAnd every place with TVs automatically loses a star."
1,"Came here 2 nights in a row while vacating at the Cancun across the street.  1st night I really only needs quarters for laundry but managed to sneak in a beer and a shot.   The bartender was very nice and helpfully.  So much so that I came back with my Wife the next night.   Again two very nice lady bartenders.  We did our part for the Vegas economy.  Dropped a couple hundred in the video poker and had a few beers.   My only issue was the \""Special Guinness Cheese sauce \"" that goes with the Giant Soft Pretzel.    Not sure if it had gone bad or what but I literally spit my food into a napkin.  \n\nWe will come back next time we are in town but I am a little scared about the food."

1,"The area seemed a little sketchy at night, but the Columbia Outlet (the only one we shopped at) was awesome with awesome prices. What more can I say other than I wished there were one in San Diego!"
1,"ATMOSPHERE: Clean booth seating, which is nice since it allows some privacy from table to table. Huge. Very  nice inside. Casual atmosphere. Would be good for groups.\nFOOD: LOTS of variety. Good selection of food with a fruit/sweets station, baked dessert, 3 entr\u00e9e sections, and sushi bar. They also had unique selection such as frog legs and raw oysters. A carving board with what looked like roast beef and crab legs. My favorites were the squid salad (not fried squid), seaweed salad, and the white fish dish - forget what it was. There were a lot of fried items which I tried to avoid but also many non-fried dishes as well. Sushi was average but not bad. Other than that nothing else too weird. The baked desserts were a bit dry, which included carrot cake. They do serve pudding and soft serve ice cream - yum. Nothing seemed liked it was sitting out too long or not fresh except for maybe the cake.\nSERVICE: Very good. Server was prompt and polite. No complaints.\nPARKING: Plenty of parking available in shopping plaza parking lot.\nPERKS: You do get a $5 off next purchase of 2 meals upon leaving. Dinner's not too pricey considering what you get at $15.\nCONCLUSION: Nice place with good food and service. I like!"
1,I really enjoyed the cupcakes from Mad Hatter since they opened. Unfortunately they decided to double the prices and as much as I like the cupcakes I rather spend my money on something else. They now charge $26 for a dozen mini-cupcakes and the previous price was $15. They lost a loyal (Chubby) customer.
0,"Awful service! We had used them prior since FedEx and the post office were unwilling to help us send a VIP package, and they were very helpful. However the next time they completely screwed us over. We once again needed something mailed to get there the next day. The lady responded \""no problem!\"" Next she takes the next day envelope and hands me a Manila envelope and says this is half the price and where you are sending it, it will get there tomorrow anyways. Then continues on to say how some customers are so dumb and overpay for things to be mailed overnight when it will get there overnight anyways. She then instructs me to put my stuff in the envelope and has me pay. She then throws the open envelope on the desk behind her!! I asked if she would seal it, and she said she would as soon as she helped the next people. Once I got home I looked up the tracking number and it was set for 4 day delivery! And it wasn't even scanned into the system until the following day! I paid \""half the price\"" =$11 to send a Manila envelope I could have easily sent myself with one stamp and it would have gotten there the same time if not sooner. DO NOT TRUST THEY KNOW BETTER THAN YOU, THEY DON'T!"

0,"Not sure how this place stays in business. There are so many things wrong here. \n\nWhen you walk on through the door you are greeted NY a dining room that looks like a bottle of Pepto Bismol exploded. There is pink everywhere! Booths, chairs, floor tiles, etc. \n\nNext you get treated to service that could best be described as glacial. A good 10 minutes from ordering drinks until you actually get them. And this with only one other table occupied. \n\nOnce you actually get to order your food you have plenty of time to talk about how horrible the decor is, as it will take forever for the food to arrive. Just don't get your hopes up to high.\n\nNot only was some of the food cold by the time we received it, it also tasted like it had been cooked several days ago and had been reheated in a microwave.\n\nPortion sizes can best be described as being appropriate for someone that is on a diet. The prices associated with the portion on the other hand would have you believe you just had a three course meal.\n\nStay away from this one. Any fast food restaurant will give you better food at a better price than this place."
0,"Steak restaurants in Las Vegas, like internet cat sites,  exist in a hyper competitive cut throat market. Some places that would be thebomb.com in other markets just can't cut the mustard when compared to Vegas Gold Standards like Carne Vino or Outback. IMHO Craftsteak is just such a restaurant- it is pretty good, but given its similar in cost to just about every steak place on the strip it isn't one I would recommend. \n\nI always get the same thing first time around- Bone in Ribeye, Potato side, Mac and Cheese- except for they don't have mac and cheese- terrorists win :(. \n\nThe Steak- the bone in ribeye was mediocre at best. Ordered medium rare the meat was barely pink which was a huge misstep. It didn't have a very good crust and was sort of bland- given how often TC yells at people on Top Chef for incorrectly seasoning, and given it was a steak and should have enough salt on it to choke a deer, this was pretty disappointing. Now again, if this was your first Vegas steak experience you could overlook this and still have a pretty good meal. But if you have been to other great steak restaurants in the area these mistakes become more crushing. \n\nNow I will say- their specialty is clearly the more expensive steaks (US and Australian Wagyu, Kobe... or Japanese Wagyu? Does anyone know what these things mean? Nope? Ok I figured). So I will admit the fault could lie with me not going for a big boy steak. \n\nPotato Gratin-this was actually pretty top notch. It has a garlic cream sauce that is STRONG so if you are on a date or with a fancy prostitute you may want to stay away.\n\nWhite Corn Grits- I'm from the dirty south so naturally I had to order this. It's not exactly what you would expect if you have been raised on three Michelin star restaurants like Waffle House- but it is chock full of so much bacon and gruyere cheese that you can't really go wrong. \n\nDessert\nThe Monkey Bread is pretty amazing- overall the sides and dessert were the stars of this meal with the steak more of a creepy extra lurking in the corner. If I went back here I would probably skip the steak altogether and get more apps/sides/desserts."
1,"I love Hawaii and I love rum and Tiki's and like Polynesian sauce from Chick Fil-A and I like Pineapples and cool looking glasses and happy hours.  I love Hulas because it has all these things.  What really makes this place is the drinks, I haven't had such good tropical drinks since i visited Hawaii, seriously they hold up and hold up well plus they come in awesome glasses that you can purchase or if your a real douche steal ( I don't condone that).  The only reason Hulas doesnt get 5 stars from me is the food, its been hit and miss for me.  Not bad but not AMAZING, and when you build a place like this with such fantastic drinks and an excellent ambiance you would only expect the food to follow suit.  That being said I will go again and try something new again and hopefully I'll find that dish that blows me away but for the mean time I'll enjoy drinking like I'm on a tropical island in the middle of the desert."
1,"We had to stop by the Apple store to replace my phone so we decided to head to CPK for lunch. It's been quite sometime since my boyfriend and I both had been to one so it sounded like a good idea.\n\nWe got seated right away as it was just lunch time on a Sunday and it wasn't to busy. We were instantly helped and our server took our drink orders. He also asked if we wanted bread and oli which we declined (as we knew we'd be eating enough carbs). He promptly brought us our drinks and what I loved about it I ordered a flavored ice tea to which he suggested me trying before adding any sweetener in it as they use syrup to make the flavors. It was perfect as is. My boyfriend ordered a pepperoni pizza and the waiter wanted to make sure he was okay with the oregano and spicy pepperoni they now use (which he was), I had the chicken tequila fettuccine w/extra cilantro. As he was putting in the order he turned to just confirm I wanted extra cilantro which I did. \n\nThe manager brought our food over in less than 10 minutes and it was perfect! About 1/4 of the way down on my ice tea our server brought me another one. \n\nThe server asked if we wanted any desert which we were stuffed anyways. My boyfriend and I both said this was one of the best service we had received from any restaurant in a long time. As we left my boyfriend mad a point to tell the manager how great the service was."
0,"Food was average at best.  Rasam was thick and opaque... Not clear and tangy with the flavor of tamarind.  Buffet left a lot to be desired.  Chicken was full of bones with little meat .... Raita was ok... Kheer was disgusting.. I didn't taste one hint of cardamom.  Worst of all, I introduced myself to Victor ( owner?) because I was interested in holding a 30 person party here in a few weeks.  He showed me the area and then never said another word to me for the rest of lunch.  The waiter also had no personality and seemed bothered to wait on my mother and I.  I told my Indian husband that I think they treated me this way because I'm not Indian and he  said... No.. They will treat all this way.  Very disappointing and rude staff.  I must say the waitress with short hair was nice.  I will never set foot in this restaurant again"
0,"ok, Tried Sauce in Chandler, n now this one.... \n\nUnless you are into over spending for less food just because it may be a little healthier, then have at it.. The flavors have been bland, and leave out of there for about 12 dollars and seriously still hungry.... \n\nI tried the Wild Mushroom pizza actually served on a Tortilla :-( lightly dusted with some cheese, ,,, mehhhhh\n\nMeatball Panini, is the only reason for the 2 stars and not 1... it did have some flavor, and the sauce it came with for dipping was decent, i would def try again forl like 6 bucks,,,, Not 10.\n\nOut of rotation ----"
1,"Great service, decor, and fun menu.\nThis new little Bistro is a foodies heaven. \nTheir 1st day had to be crazy but they got our order out in timely fashion and got the order correct. \n\nFor me: a Tino's Salad with their lick-the-bowl cider dressing. This comes with beets, goat cheese and bacon. All of which are delicious, but the tiny shred of beets would be so much better left BiGGER and the bacon was too hard to enjoy. Still, I'd order it again. \n\nMy friend: Chop Salad with their Greens Blend lettuce. Love the fact you can choose from Spring Mix or their Kale, arugula Greens Blend! \n\nWe shared: Olives with Goat Cheese & Pesto which was very tasty on crostini. Lots of olives come in a bowl topped with a delicious blend of tasty spread."
1,"I'm not sure what  that \""liberal NY'er\"" is talking about on her review but this place was magical and I am from NY and NJ!\n\nFirst off, its an actual authentic old western town. It is so charming it's not even funny!! \n\nThe mine tour was fun and the tour guide was an angel. My sister passed out at the start of the tour and he stopped the tour and helped her back upstairs to the ice cream parlor ,got her water and a dr. and stayed with us to make sure she was ok. He was super friendly, sweet and for the first part of the tour I saw explained what all the tools were in the mine, how they were used and everything else you could possibly want to know about those days. His name was Chris BTW! \n\nWe got there late in the day so sadly everything was closed but the saloon by the time my sister was up to par again so we went to have dinner and watch the musician. I ordered the flat iron steak and backed potatoe and my sister being a vegetarian ordered a grilled cheese and fries. I ordered my steak rare which RARELY ever comes that way but it did and it was tender and juicy. The waitress was friendly and the musician was fantastic! The decor was so spot on and made me feel like I was back in those days! \n\nWe really wanted to see everything so we came back the next morning and went to all the shops. We got our pictures taken in old western wear and the woman was sooo friendly and dressed us up exactly how we were imagining! The gift shop had tons of neat little things like cactus candy, windchimes, and homemade TASTY fudge!! We visited the patry shop and the iced mocha I had was great. \n\nWe decided to try the train tour instead of venturing to the mine again and when the sweet woman at the counter heard what happened the day before she gave us free tickets. Whiplash was the train conductor and he was as friendly as can be. We had talked to him earlier in the day in the pastry shop and when we realized he was the conductor we were all delighted to see each other. His tour was very informative. He talked about how the mine started, who took it over, how it progressed over the years and how it came to be a ghost town! We took a TON of really fun pictures! \n\nThe bordello wasnt open yet when we were there since it was early but nect time im up in that area im definitely going back. ALSO, they said that they hold weddings there and let me tell you, if the day ever came where I was getting married I would absolutely have it there. Theres a cute little church and horseback rides!\n\nIt was truly a magical place that I enjoyed more than I ever thought I would. It made my first ever girls weekend truly special!!"
1,"It's a half mile away, I can run in and out in a  few minutes without aisles and aisles of streamlining children and preening mommies, there are lots of really, really good deals, and the guy who cooks up the samples (I'm embarrassed I forgot his name) has some great ideas.\nWhat more can you ask for???  OK, OK, if you like to inspect each apple, choose from 12 varieties of granola, etc., you won't like it.  \nFor example, choices of apples are usually four packs of either Gala, Fuji, or Granny Smith.  Take or leave.  BTW, the Fujis are usually the best.\nThe F&E brand items are hit or miss, mostly hit.  I like the F&E putenesca sauce.  Come to think of it, there have been a few \""misses\"" but I cannot remember them... (remember the over 40 bit, Ok?).  The olive tapenade tastes straight out of an Italian deli, the stuffed baked potatoes are a great meal in a pinch.  The giant boxes of mixed salad greens are a staple in our house.\nThe meat selection is pretty darn extensive - a variety of pork and beef cuts, sausages, and sometimes even lamb. They have chicken also, but since I am allergic to it I never paid it much attention.  The cooked shrimp makes a good quick meal - either get a package that includes the cocktail sauce packets or get a bottle from the condiments aisle (the F&E brand is surprisingly good).  The tilapia is excellent.  Grill with a  little salt and olive oil. \nFor ease and budget-tending, I love F&E.  Tip:  Avoid Sundays, as that is when their stock is lowest."
1,"Yum! For all those skeptics who fear trying vegan cuisine, this is the place to start. I have not had anything on the menu that I disliked, and you would never know that these dishes are completely free of animal products. The Green Burger and the Mexicali Burger totally satisfy my need to chomp into a big ol' burger, which I occasionally miss since I became a vegetarian. The Drunken Mushroom \""Chicken\"" Bowl is amazing. All of the vegan \""meats\"" and \""cheeses\"" they use at Green are awesome. They even sell some of them in their mini grocery store so you can take that vegan deliciousness home with you. And the desserts... oh, boy! If you haven't tried it already, go now!"
0,"First, the cost was ridiculously expensive.  I think I could have gone to Disneyland for less.  The animals lived in sub par conditions.  I was horrified to see their baby hogwarts in a glass room with electric blankets hanging down and the hogwarts nibbling on the electrical cords.  I was saddened to see the white tiger pace as they were in a cage too small and looked so unhappy.  On top of a very high admission fee, they also charged a few dollars for every attraction.  I will never return."
0,There was nothing wrong with the service. The food was just not great. We ordered 2 appetisers and 3 entrees. The appetisers were good. They were creative and flavorful. The entrees left a lot to be desired. Just didn't make the grade. The portions were enourmous...Food marginal at best. Will not be back. Would much rather go to Carraba's.
1,"Alright so like most of my reviews it was my first time here. I got the Grilled Chicken Broken Rice I believe it was R5 on the menu. It was pretty good I'm not going to lie. But the rice was a little sweet. Because they give you fish sauce and I was just listening to my sister when she said to pour it on the rice and the chicken. Maybe next time I can put a little less on but it was definitely good. The chicken was also pretty good and if you like spicy things you should use the chili paste, in the rice and on the chicken. I will possibly come here again but I don't think it's worth the drive for me. It is good but not to die for."
1,"I really appreciate a bar whose focus is on mixology, so when you get something other than a Bud or Coors you're not automatically slapped on the forehead with any of the below stickers:\n\n- Hipster\n- Elitist and/or snob\n- Oh, you drink craft beer AND drive a Fiat? You must be so cultured. \n\nI came here on a Sunday night with some girlfriends who work in Strip hotels as concierge, so of course we had to start with a self-guided grand tour to get an idea of this whole shebang. This way they could be as well-educated as possible when offering Downtown to the three undergrad tourists per month who take up their recommendation of the area because this trio's too broke to go to a nightclub. Sorry, that was a tangent. \n\nWe posted up at the bar and watched as a live band prepared to set up while we chatted with our bartender Dan and amongst ourselves, after having come downstairs from ooh-ing and ahh-ing at the gorgeous rooftop patio. I got the Little Hot Mess which was made with muddled strawberry - pretty much summer in a glass, and what's not to love about that?\n\nUpstairs was laid back and casual with strung lights - great for groups, while the main bar area below had a speakeasy feel with a vintage-y looking menu inviting guests to peruse a large selection of well-designed libations, with specials for Wednesday nights only. \n\nThe only thing I was bummed about was that I hadn't visited this place sooner! :)"
1,"This is a great hole in the wall sushi secret! Friendly, attentive, and generous servings."
1,"Outside what is expected from a normal Embassy Suites Hotel, but what a beautiful view from your room. Customer service is outstanding and of course who can say enough good about the complimentary breakfast!!! Great Embassy experience, this will become a regular for me when visiting Scottsdale Arizona! Highly recommended family friendly place to stay, clean comfy an the kids love it. Pool is emaculate,\n as expected form embassy suits."
0,"My girlfriend and I were excited to try something different up north here.  I may return for happy hour but she certainly wouldn't. \n\nThe vibe was cool. Music was really loud, but it was a Friday night so I get if they were trying to keep up with Blue Martini across the way. I was surprised at how busy it was when I walked in but then excited about the people watching. It's a neat, small space. \n\nThe host was great. Very friendly and helpful. \n\nI finally found a couple of seats at the bar and ordered a couple of the specialty drinks on the menu when I girlfriend arrived. She got the yoga marg and I got some blanco drink with grapefruit. The drinks were tasty, but the bartender was saltier than the rim of my glass. We immediately were taken back by her passiveness and abrupt responses to our questions about the menu. (Which consisted of one question- street tacos are three to an order. Do we pick three or is it three of the same). \n\nAnyhow, my girlfriend had a shard of glass shoot through her straw into her mouth. Not upset about it, it happens. I worked in the industry for years so hey, you burn the ice, make new drinks and apologize. No such luck. We told the bar back, he alerted the bartender, she got irritated. He had to convince to to make a new drink. She made hers, set it down and walked away. No apology, no words even. I grabbed the bar back and said, \""I hate to be a pain in the a*$ but the waters and my drink came from the same well. We need these remade too if you could. \"". He was totally on board but this irritated her further. She made the drinks and never burned a well. I asked her if the drinks came from the same one and her response, three times, was, \""I promise... You're good.\""  Never, it came from a different well; im sorry that happened; let me check; is your friend ok... After twenty minutes I grabbed a manager to let her know that there was ice in one of the wells because I watched to see neither get burned and somebody was going to end up chewing on more glass. The manager immediately dealt with the bar and we never saw our bartender again.  Until she threw the check down. \n\nI'll give credit on the place, the food was ok and the atmosphere made up for it. That bartender though made us never want to go back. Before any of this happened, we had tried to make up an excuse to sit on the other end of the bar to avoid her attitude.  \n\nI've been in the industry for a long time and have had yelp reviews written about me. Some good. Some bad. You can't win em all. You can, however, be nice to people, even when you're busy, and let the chips fall where they may.  Unfortunately she chose to play her cards horribly.  Owners, talk to your girl and make a real smile a requirement."
1,"OK I have this thing were I refuse to write reviews about anything in Vegas especially since i've been there so many times I think i've been to everything and well that would just take up too much time to review every bar and hotel. HOWEVER, treasure island has never ceased to fail me. The first time I came to Vegas (legally) I checked into the T I with my friends, and from what I can remember it was a fun trip while staying here but as the years have passed something always drags me back. I've stayed at really nice hotels such as the Bellagio, The Wynn, Excalibur etc..even crappy ones such as the Luxor (ugh, which reminds me I should probably write a horrible review for them) But in between all of those trips I still manage to stay at TI when I can just because it's one of those hotels that aren't TOO fancy and definately not low end. \n\nThey have this scent every time you walk in that really gets me (I dunno, I'm  a sucker for small things I guess) It smells like baby oil of some sort. The slot machines in there are really good if you're not TOO much into gambling like myself (I'll play like 25 cent blackjack all night) .Customer service there is great. I'll never forget the time my friend and I were super wasted when we got to our hotel that we got into our pj's and next thing I know I'm locked out of the room and she's passed out- and I'm literally in a little black nightie, so I have to go all the way downstairs like 16 levels in an elevator and through the casino (and of course there were kids everywhere for some wedding so i'm stuck in the elevator with some 13 year old starring at me up and down) so then I go and ask customer service in this teeny little black dress to please give me a key since the hotel wasn't even in my name! I think they just felt sorry for me and let me in while holding in their laughs, but either way it was nice of them cause it was so embarrassing. Oh, and if it's your birthday tell them when you check in and they will send you a free bottle of champagne up to your room. They also have a buncha goodie buy 1 drink get 1 free coupons when you check in. \n\nThe club there is really lame though, I mean for one its owned by that Ed Hardy guy, Christian Audigier so that says it all already...but since we got in free being hotel guests and all we gave it a shot, it's definately a place to be if you want to be surrounded by a buncha tools. Oh and the bartender was extremely rude. But besides that TI is a perfect hotel to stay at, and this is coming from a girl who's been to em all.\n\nOH and that new $20 resort fee is bull, yes, but EVERY hotel does it not just TI... its a new Vegas rule now which is lame I know, but someone told me that if enough people complain about it then they are gonna get rid of it. So complain at the front desk about it when they mention it at the end! Throw a hissy fit. But then apologize and say it's not their fault cause TI employees are super sweet but the new Vegas rule is just BS."
1,"Came here last weekend with the family because I've been craving for some mahi mahi for awhile. We ordered 2 mahi mahi dinners, butterfish, and chilli with spaghetti. Mahi mahi was good as always! Great portions 2 people can share a plate, but leftovers taste just as good the next day. The butterfish was great, especially because the portion was bigger than it was in the past. It was the frat time we ordered chilli. Can't go wrong with that either. After all, it's Zippys! Can't believe we didn't know  that after all year years.. Oh, and to top things off we ordered a hot fudge sundae. It was great! My 3 year old ate most if it though lol. Service was good also. The waiter was very friendly"
0,"Espionage is a surprisingly busy club and bar that sits at the top of Victoria Street, I say surprising as it's not really a great place to go for a night out. The music is charty and popular, the drinks are cheap and entrance is free, so I can see why the club going public flock here in their hoards. The clientele tend to be slightly older than the borderline underagers that herd to Stereo and Cav on a Friday or Saturday night - however they don't appear to be any wiser and the same sort of debauched behaviour is prevalent (people being sick in the loos, sleazy guys etc). However, of all Edinburgh's terrible clubs, this is the one in which I would feel most comfortable, so I suppose that's a backhanded compliment; I'd still rather be at home in my jammies than tearing up the dancefloor in here though."
1,"I had never heard of this place until a co-worker mentioned it a couple of weeks ago. I have been twice since. The pick two combo comes with a full sandwich and either soup or salad. Every meal includes a chocolate dipped strawberry. The staff is as friendly as they come and gets through a long line of lunch goers in a hurry. Your lunch will run you about ten bucks, with a beverage, if you opt for the combo. Their variety of sandwiches, soups and salads is sure to include something for everyone. You order and pay at the counter so there is no problem splitting the check or waiting around for the check if you are one of those who has a boss watching the clock to make sure you don't take an extra minute during your lunch break."
1,"Amazing food, wonderful staff and good atmosphere. Loved the wine selection (even though I'm mostly a beer gal). The food was perfect. Totally recommend for a date night and can't wait to go again. It's family style with the sides and the protein choices are made for even the pickest eaters."
1,"Four single(esque) girls in Vegas over Labor Day weekend?\n\nYeah, you know how it goes....\n\nAfter doing some sneaky maneuvering to the front of the line, we were \""granted\"" entrance into what had to be THE spot to be on Friday night.\n\nAs it was the opening night, it was doubly packed!  The main floor was packed wall to wall with beautiful people, all waiting in anticipation for Britney Spears....not.  Strangely enough, we got in just as she was making her grand entrance.  What overrated nonsense.  Paying someone thousands of dollars to show up for 5 minutes and say hello....bleh.\n\nAnyway, the club itself is fantastic!   Plenty of space to hold the large crowds (upstairs was a lot more comfortable to dance in) and quick bartender service!  DJ AM was spinning and he was actually REALLY good!\n\nA definite must see for those who have not been there yet!  Hottest new club in Vegas...just be prepared to wait...it's the Vegas way!"
0,"So I went to eat here tonight with my hubby and we got the 2 for $20. He got the chicken crispers with buffalo sauce & I got the chicken fajitas. Well when the food came I noticed that my chicken looked a little weird. As I cut into the chicken it didn't cut like normal chicken. I took a bit & it tasted spongy; the texture and taste were really gross. So I asked my husband about his chicken & he said it was also weird. Needless to say we both could not eat it. Now we have been to this chilies before & we always get some kind of chicken dish and we have never had this problem. I asked the server if they changed their chicken & she said no. But something was definitely off. Here's my tip to you, if you go here do not get anything with chicken breast. I'm not sure if they changed vendors or what, but the chicken has definitely changed."
0,"I find myself here nearly every other week because of the Target/PetSmart combo conveniently located by my job. I really loathe it. Overdone design, creepy constant music, the fact that the mall's outdoors, terrible parking lot planning....\n\nOh. And it shoots lasers.\n\nSeriously.\n\nLasers! Are you freaking kidding?!? I guess this falls under \""overdone design.\""\n\nI have had surprisingly good experiences at the movie theater here, though. There are a lot of teens, but for some reason they seem to misbehave less at Tempe Marketplace than at Chandler Fashion Square. Maybe I've just been lucky."
0,"This is probably the worst hotel/resort I have stayed at.. The only reason I gave them a star was because the front staff was friendly. First off the rooms are WAY smaller then they look in the pictures, the furniture is    chipped and cheap looking. I was excited to stay here because I love the decor of boutique hotels. This one Looks like a fancy  motel 6, definitely not a resort. No clocks, No fridge (extra cost) and no blankets. The waitress at Addiction was nice until we had a question about the check then she quickly had turned into a b*tch. Needless to say I will not be returning here nor would I recommend it to anyone."
0,"heard bad things about this spot and after experiencing it personally, it is not a good spot.."
0,"Also the only buffet I would eat downtown.\nWaitstaff if they weren't over the top friendly they seemed bothered. The cooks really made me feel like I was bothering them. Really your job is to cut me Roast beef sorry its so tough you need a chainsaw to get through it not my fault. All in all pretty crappy. I tried it 3 times breakfast, lunch, and dinner gross, grosser, grossest guess I wasn't drunk enough. What really sucks is unless you want to have a $100 meal or a .99cent shrimp cocktail that was the best option. Very disappointed"
1,"One of the best chain sub shops around.  Fresh ingredients, good bread and FAST as hell.  I know if I've got 30 min before my next meeting I can be in and out and eating a tasty sub no matter how long the line is when I get there.  \n\nStill won't knock out my favorite from the FLA, Larry's Giant Subs (c'mon Larry and Mitch... expand to Charlotte please!), but a great option to have close by the office."
0,"If you have a Groupon, get your money back because if you actually see her show up, she won't use enough product on your hair (as referenced by another reviewer). This is the second appointment I have made to fulfill this voucher. The first one was cancelled by Sam via text when she ran out of product. The second one took some maneuvering as I, like many other mothers I am sure, needed to block out a time when I would have someone watching them. I picked a week when my husband was off work for a tournament he was playing in. He left a game early today so that I could make my appointment. I was soooo excited to get some time out of the house and get my hair done. But, there I sat in my car, parked in front of Artistry Salon, waiting... The door was locked and I received no response to my text, nor to my voicemails. My first appointment was in June. Today is October 30. There will be no more chances. I have received my refund from Groupon. Sam, at Artistry Salon doesn't possess the follow through to handle a marketing tool like Groupon. I wish I would have read the other reviews before I made the 32 mile drive out there. If I had hired a baby sitter, my rant would be MUCH more colorful but to simplify, STAY AWAY!!"
0,"We arrived at 8:30 pm and the restaurant was busy, we were told it would be a 20 minute wait and 10 minutes later we were seated in the bar area. It would have been nice to be given a choice. We decided to order entrees since it was late. The dinner service was poor the entire night. To begin, my family is French and have lived in the US and ordered water without ice from the server. The busser arrived with the water glasses and they were filled with ice, they asked the busser to bring water without ice and he rolled his eyes and said he would let the waiter know. He eventually returned with two glasses and we assumed he would return, with the other two, he never did. He was asked later to bring a glass with no ice. We inquired about the wines and the server could not offer any information except to try a cab. \n\nThe server suggested adding the salad bar after we ordered. It was very disappointing, two of the trays were empty and a few other trays were almost empty. I was happy I did not order the  buffet.\n\nWe were in the middle of eating our salads and the entrees arrived. It would have been nicer to have enjoyed the salad. When the food arrived the tables were so close that we had to handle our own plates as the server could not get behind our chairs to put down the plates. The filet mignons were dry and when asked for extra sauce the server returned and said it was impossible as the sauces were cooked to order with each filet. The skirt steak was flavorful and juicy. The bouillabaisse  passed the palate test. \n\nWill I return? No. The  level of service was poor for the price that was paid. The second night when we walked by they attempted to entice us with a special, we all walked by, especially after I apologized for recommending Pampas. I also noticed that there seemed to be a lack of servers with meats for those who chose the rodizio."
0,Came here for breakfast waiting to get my haircut at the barber close by. The guy who cooked my food just touched a bunch of money and didn't bother to wash his hands. The bacon looked over a week old and the potatoes looked a few days old as well.
1,"Alright, I loved the atmosphere, and the company, I love sitting at the bar and drinking wine and enjoying ridiculously rich food. And the food was amazing really - perfect pork belly, and lovely duck on inventive grains and vegetables, pricey but served up in hearty portions and oh my don't even get me started on the giant slab of brownie made by the chef's mom because what a treat! and what a daunting thing! \n\nBut here's my one little gumble, maybe I'm a little tired of all this heavy buttery fatty food. Maybe it gets a little one-note?"
0,"I totally agree with Tina S. for such a large and beautiful store to be quite honest......the selection in a word.....SUCKS. The only reason I didn't give this store one star was because it is a very spacious store....but I think they waste a lot of space......and the customer service was excellent. However when you go into a Nike Store of any kind.....exception being the outlets.......there should be more than 7 or 8 NFL team Jerseys and T-Shirts in the place. I was extremely disappointed with that....and for that fact that is why I have never been a huge fan of Nike products or stores. Eat, Drink, and be Merry my Friends!!!!!"
0,"Horrible. Granted I went here almost 4 months ago and maybe its changed but when i wen it was bad. I went through the drive thru. You could overly tell the burger was a frozen patty I  took two bites and ended up throwing it away. I also got a choc. milkshake that i tossed in the trash. You could taste that the ice cream was frost bitten. Never going back, sorry."
0,"Terrible experience, Elena the manager refused to seat us anywhere near people we know - even though they came in a whole 30 minutes before us unless we pay the 18% mandatory gratuity.  They separated a mom away from her baby because of this rule - it's ridiculous given that there is no line at all on a Friday night.  Terrible customer service.\n\nNext time do not tell them you know people."
0,"The food here is overpriced and flavorless. We came here after a late night show and decided to stop here instead of our trusty late night spot Earl of Sandwich. \n\nService was slow, but friendly. Our server was nice, but food took a long time to come out and refills were slow as well. I'm usually a stickler when it comes to refills. I often drink a lot and expect refills to be generous. \n\nMost of our party ordered breakfast, which is usually a safe bet. Food was bland and not particularly appealing to the eye. It's the strip and clearly the food will be overpriced, but there are many better values to be had, so just skip this and go someplace else."
1,"Went for a late lunch and it was an excellent experience from entering to leaving. I had the Pot Roast sandwich and my wife, a Hamburger Patty Melt. Both were delicious, the service relaxed and a good value. Don't miss their brand of tap beer."
0,"I've been coming to this Kobe Sushi Bistro for the last few months. Over the course of the last few weeks I've been noticing something funny. Now before I actually decide to say what that is I do want to go on record saying that the food is excellent and the service is mediocre at best. The thing I've been noticing though, is that every time we use a card to pay (still tipping 20% in cash), we always seem to see an extra charge on our card. I've contacted management and they didn't seem that interested. In short we paid for a $60 plus meal and was charged $80 on our credit card while still leaving them a decent sized tip. So after a few calls to our bank they've notified us of fraudulent charges coming from there. We were refunded the extra amount that was stolen, but this doesn't negate the fact that they made no attempt to fix this issue. They clearly have a leak in their system or a waiter/waitress that is charging extra to the cards. I won't be returning any time soon and I'm actually sad to say that to a place I've spent hundreds of dollars on."
0,"Worst car rental experience ever. Arrived in Phoenix after booking a car 3 months earlier, I had a late flight, landed at 11:30\nand was told they had no cars on the lot. Do Not Book Here."
0,"This has always been our favorite restaurant for celebrations but we're going to have to rethink that.  This is now the 3rd time we have had either bad service or less-than-excellent food.  Nadias is not a cheap restaurant -- the two of us each had one cocktail, an appetizer and main course:  $110 before tip.  For that price I expect that my food will be top-notch and the service impeccable.  First our foie gras went to another table and sat there for quite a while before the waiter realized it had gone to the wrong table.  By the time it got to our table it was stone-cold.  We ended up sending it back to get heated back up.  Then, no soup spoon -- we had to ask for one.  Then my salad had the wrong dressing on it -- had to send that back.  On top of this we witnessed multiple f***-ups so bad that I over heard the owner/chef griping at the wait staff -- and later, the sous chef had to go to the wait staff area/garde manger kitchen to get them to pick up their dishes that had been sitting on the line.  Nadias used to have an edge but it seems to have dulled with time!"
1,"I had been by here several times on lunch hour, but parking was typically difficult.  On this occasion a car  had just departed and I found a spot, so in I went.\n\nThe order counter had their specials up front and center - Nice, makes it easy on us first - timers.\n\nI ordered the lunch special; chicken sandwich, salad or fries (salad for me) and 24 oz soda.  Total price with tax was $8.77.  The salad was great, lots of variety and when I had chosen teh bleu cheese dressing the lady at the food order counter asked me if I wanted crumbled bleu on it. \nYes Please!\n\nShe didn't skimp and this was one great salad.  The chicken sandwich had a spicey rub on it which was just the right touch to balance the salad.\nPriced well, quick service, lots on knick-knacks onthe walls."
1,"This the best BBQ place I have been to in Phoenix. It may not look high-end, but the service and food is excellent. My only complaint is the time it takes to complete the order, however, that is understandable because of the taste and freshness."
0,"Any one who gives this place more than 3 stars is taste bud deficient. Lesson #1: good BBQ has some smoke to the meat (this place has NO smoky flavor to their meat)\nLesson #2: there was no smoke ring that denote it spent any time cooking low and slow like they advertise. \nLesson #3: the meat fell of the bone (Great BBQ is removed from the bone, not fall off the bone. Kansas City BBQ Society rules)\nI suspect that the baby back ribs I was served were first boiled, then placed on the grill right before it was slathered with raunchy sauce.\nThe only reason it got 2 stars was because our waitress was fabulous, giving great service with nice atmospheres."
0,"Let's start with the positives, banh mi and banh xeo were great. The other three dishes we got to sample, not too flavorful. Perhaps because we went at 2:30 pm and it's an off time (still no excuse) but the entr\u00e9e dishes were bland with only 4-5 pieces of meat. Can I get some meat in flavorless sauce with my rice? Shesh.  \n\nPerhaps they should just specialize on banh mi sandwiches. We'll make the drive into town and continue going to Central for better Vietnamese food."
0,"My husband and I just left Hi-Scores about 30 min ago and we both agreed we will not be going back! First, we couldn't find parking and so we had to park in the hotel parking lot next door. (That doesn't really bother us because we like to walk sometimes) Second, we go into the place and after we get our wrist bands (for being over 21) we just walked around aimlessly becuase no one had said where to go or anything about the place. We were so lost! So we end up by the games and luckily there was a guy sitting there and he asked if we have ever been there and then told us a little about the games. That helped for a few minutes but we had originally come to watch the walking dead. So after playing a game of pinball we start to walk and came across the 21 and over bar. We found a seat and had ordered our drinks. \n\nI had ordered coke and a water and my husband ordered a beer. It took 10 minutes to get just the coke and water. Then another 10 just for his beer! Sad thing is we were sitting right across from the bar and probably could have walked up and gotten it faster. The other thing that we couldn't stand was how noisy it was considering lots of people were there to watch the show. I understand it is a bar but when you have something like that going on they could have at least closed the doors to the gaming room or the front door! My husband and I will have to watch it again tomorrow to actually hear what they were saying. \n\nWe felt so weird being there because it seemed like it was just someone's house party and we were the outsiders. Everyone stared at us because we hadn't been there before. But what confuses me is why no one showed us or told us about the other side of the building to the \""players club\""!?!?! And besides the pretzel bytes I didn't see anything else I liked on the menu. \n\nWe won't be going here again!! Don't go unless you are best friends with the owner! Otherwise you will be lost and left out of everything and have poor service!"
0,"I had a Groupon and was first told that it wasn't good for happy hour peices. Service was good, but the food was meteocre. The chili and corn cakes disappointed me becuase over the overall blandness. \n\nThe side salad was miniscule but tasty. The onion rings were really good, but not enough to make me go back."
0,cockroach infested! terrible beyond belief. huge ripoff!
1,"Yay... good food and good service.  Las Vegas pricing but what can one expect in Las Vegas?  We waited in a line of about 25 people.  Didn't take long since the tables were turning rather efficiently, yet nobody seemed rushed to eat and leave (we certainly weren't and by the time we were seated the line was at least twice as long).  All dishes we tried were yummy... very very yummy.  The place was full of Asian people, quite obviously visiting from Asia.  They seemed to like the food too, so it must be good!  Watermelon juice was quite impressive: very refreshing liquid watermelon."
0,"My husband and I decided to try this place because we had won a gift card at our daughter's school's silent auction. We arranged for childcare and went out to the casino on a Sunday night. The ambiance is seriously lacking due to \""windows\"" that open up into the casino allowing sound and smoke to invade like a flock of rabid pigeons at a garden party. We were seated at a tiny table in a corner in front of the aforementioned windows. This definitely was not adding to the desired \""date\"" feel. \n\nThe menu was that of a posery \""Bamboo Club\"" but lacked much of the club's appeal (and that's not saying much). We are very familiar with Asian food as my husband is Chinese and I was raised in a Chowhouse. The food was definitely not what one would could authentic, but more of a merely adequate take on fusion. We started with the Ahi appetizer. I believe we enjoyed the slaw it was served on more than the fish itself, as it was none too impressive. We decided to share an entree because we wanted to do three courses. For this we chose the seafood hot pot. I thought the sauce was good, but did not warrant the green curry label. I also thought salmon was a strange choice for the fish chunks in the dish. A white fish would have taken on the curry flavor much better. Salmon isn't something I really expect in cooked Asian dishes. When we ordered this dish, the waitress recommended that we not get the fried rice because the dish was \""more like a stew\"". We hadn't even discussed fried rice because we knew what what we were ordering. Maybe this is a suggestion that should be reserved for people who ask for fried rice to avoid sounding condescending. \n\nThe desserts were decidedly not Asian, despite making a dessert spring roll. We tried the creme brulee because I'm a sucker for it. A little bit grainy IMO but it had a good flavor. \n\nWhen it came time to settle the bill, all love was lost. They do not take Ling and Louie's gift cards! This was the sole reason we tried this place. The manager was sent over and dealt with us in a very patronizing (emphasis on very) tone about how he just couldn't do anything about it. When the waitress (Brittani?) returned she inquired what he had done to help and we told her nothing ,and that we were pretty angry. She then left for awhile and came back, telling us that she had asked him (the manager) to take off the entree and my hot tea. He did this, but only after she told him that we had considered leaving our gift card and splitting. Seriously, I have never considered a dine and dash until this jerk spoke to me like I was a four year old who had eaten too many cookies. Thanks Brittani, you're doing what it takes to make customers happy. Your manager, however, will rip the proverbial mask from the lackluster ambiance and flavors and expose this place for what it really is, a casino food stand. Think I'll go to Panda Express next time."
0,"Terrible set up for concerts.  For general admission concert tickets, they have the floor split into two sections and make the first people who arrive completely fill up one section before they open the second section.  This punishes the people who stood in line early and arrived first by not letting them line up around the stage.  Consequently, the people who didn't wait at all get the best seats in the house and the people who waited the longest get the worst.  At the Avett Brothers concert, I talked to a husband and wife who camped out since 8am to get close to the stage and ended up in the back because they were made to fill up the first half of the GA section.  Terrible planning."
1,I'm a big Philly Cheese Steak fan but I've yet to try an Italian Beef Sandwich.  So when I saw the truck and the ensuing crowd I had to stand in line to see what the fuss was all about. I ordered a sandwich and it was a juicy delightful surprised.  On Man V Food Adam shows you how to properly eat these things with a lean so you don't dribble or waste any of the juicy goodness served up and I'm so glad I saw that episode and was prepared.  \n\nI don't know if I will ever give up my Philly but if these guys are nearby I will definitely have to stop and think about it for a few seconds.
1,"The first thing that I saw, when I walked up to put my name on the list to be seated, were a bunch of white people and an Asian guy.  The girls taking down names were Latinas.  The first thought that popped into my head was \""Where all the soul brothas and sistas at?!?\""  You can't have a soul food place, without the folks who invented soul food.  WTH?\n\nBut, alas, my fears were washed away.  Apparently, they were smart and showed up early, before Lo-Lo's opened, to get out of the heat and seated quickly.  Gotta remember that the next time because there is no waiting indoors.  You either gotta stand under a tiny 8x8 tent they set up or along the side of the building in the alley way.  So not cool, when it's already 100 degrees at 10am.  \n\nCan you see me sweating?  Not pretty.\n\nAfter a 35 minute wait, we were quickly shuffled into the a cramped little room.  Our orders were quickly taken.  Not even ten minutes later, the food arrived.  My \""Toy-Toy\"" (two fried wings with a waffle) was delish!!  The chicken was cooked to perfection.  Crispy skin on the outside, juicy in the middle.  Finger lickin goodness.  The waffle was great, too.  Slightly crispy on the outside, soft on the inside.  \n\nI have to admit, this place is waaay better than Roscoe's Chicken and Waffles.  Though, I've been a fan of theirs for years, the quality has slipped and the chicken was, more times than not, overcooked.  They're getting kicked to the curb.  Lo-Lo's is now my favorite chicken and waffle place.  \n\nDespite the crampedness (is that even a word?) of the place, I'm still giving it a full 5-stars.  It's worth the wait and worth being up close and personal with your tableside neighbor.  Customer service quick and friendly.  Yes, it's a hole-in-the-wall place, but that's what makes it even more authentic.  It's unique, has a great vibe and great food.  Next time, I'm making room for some of the red velvet cake."
1,"VERY SEXY SHOW! Very Vegas! Talented performances. A must see with your hubby, partner, or boyfriend. Its got something for everyone if you know what I mean, and it definitely gets you in the mood to have some dirty fun ;o)"
0,"This is short and sweet about the service at City Bar in Aria. I'll have preface this by saying that Aria is one of my absolute favorite casinos in Las Vegas because it's modern, doesn't smell like cigarette smoke, and has great options for gambling, eating, and drinking. I truly do love this place.\n\nOur group wanted to drink here at City Bar. However, we decided at the last minute or rather within a minute of sitting down to go somewhere else. Mind you the waitress didn't even approach us yet. As our group is getting up, the waitress is walking over and we tell her that we decided to go somewhere else. Her response, \""Oh good!\"" And she walked back to where her co-worker was standing to continue her chit-chatting.\n\nWe were caught off guard by this because normally the waitress will be more polite. To say it out loud for potential customers to hear is uncalled for. It's not like we ordered a bunch of drinks and changed our mind. We literally walked in, sat down, and then got up. For her to respond in such a rude manner was uncalled for.\n\nAfter we left the bar, others in my group had heard what she said so we agreed to just go somewhere else for drinks and gambling. Some wanted to gamble and drink at Aria, but after that, we were just fine leaving. I, for one, do not appreciate service like that and I'm glad we didn't stay there for drinks considering the  surprisingly rude response we received. I don't mind giving this place another try, but there are other places I'd rather go to first."
0,"Below average in more than one category.\nMassive steak portions. As one example the prime rib I believe is 34 oz, but you can't get a smaller size.  Another example is the 26 oz. ribeye.  It's kind of a \""Heart Attack Grill\"" methodology for the portion sizes, except the HAG has beef that is really flavorful, unlike this place!  I ended up getting the 8 oz petite filet since I didn't want to gorge.....cooked exactly as I asked, but nothing remarkable to write home about.\nAs an appetizer, I had the French onion soup.  There was some annoying sweet taste in the soup, which overwhelmed  any other flavor.  The cheese topping the soup was tasteless.  My friend had the colossal shrimp cocktail, and it was massive....only 2 shrimp, and at least the presentation gets an A+.  For $27, I would expect a lot from a shrimp cocktail!\nFor prices, I believe the petite filet was $52, beers were $12, horseradish sauce $5, and the French onion soup was $14.....with the Total Rewards card discount.\n\nService was very good, but you won't feel pampered here.\n\nOh Caesars, why did you ever replace Neros Steakhouse with this place?"
1,I recently attended a wedding at Sassi. The venue was beautiful and the food was excellent. I would recommend this venue to anyone looking to get married in the Scottsdale area.
0,"Thank you, Lonie. I appreciate you taking the time to reply. And you know my review wasn't malicious, just a factual accounting of how the visit unfolded. My brother's tip $? I wasn't aware, but I think that's how he expressed his feeling of also being non-plussed. \n\nCuriously, I did receive a Yelp \""compliment\"" from a certain male related to Nosh & Swig soon after my review. This compliment simply stated, \""You're a bitch.\"" So you might want to check with your cook-husband (or other partners?) to see if they felt the need to reach out to me in that particular way. [Definitely not returning, now... Who knows what would befall my food.]\n\nLastly, I've had no less than 10 \""thank you's\"" from fellow Yelpers regarding my review. Safe to say that I'm not alone in wondering where the overly generous 5-star reviews are coming from. Good yelpers aren't so easily impressed. 5-stars are rare, and usually hard-earned; saved for the highest level of culinary (and consumer) enjoyment.\n\nGood luck and continue with the improvements. Make sure you let the good reviews happen organically and honestly. And maybe take the Yelp keys away from whomever thinks its ok to be nasty to us patrons."
1,"Came in hungry and left full and satisfied, great choice for dinner since I'm a picky eater."
0,"The service at this location has gone down hill as of late. I took my Mom here to eat today, and arrived a little after 11 am. No one in the place but us.Stood at the counter about 10 minutes before someone finally came up to take our order. Then had to wait another 15 minutes for the food, like they were open but not ready for any customers.\nAlso, Wendy's really need to revamp the way they refill drinks. You have to go back to the counter and wait for some one to refill your drink in between filling the food orders. Why should you have to stand there and wait when 99.99% of all fast food chains have a self serve refill station or two. I stood there waiting while some girl was filling orders. I know she saw me standing there, but never offered me a refill. Finally got a refill from another employee.\nC'mon Wendys, get with the times and install a self serve refill station so customers won't have to stand in a long line waiting on refills."
1,"Delicious cupcakes! Every single cupcake I've had here is great! Among my faves are the Oh My Ganache!, the Tickle Me Pink, the Red Velvet. It costs about $2.50 per cupcake, and a dozen goes for $28.\n\nThe shop features cute little trinkets like cards and even aprons! If you get a chance, look at their bulletin board. There are celebrities featured on it, including Lance Bass coming by for a specially made \""cupcake cake\"" celebrating Hairspray (I think that was it). \n\nYou've gotta try it!"
0,"The show that the first poster, Brent R., saw was probably not the same show that I saw. The theater was small and cozy,so it didn't matter where you sat, you'll have a good view of the stage. There is a bar inside the theater, that's a plus for customers who likes a cocktail while watching the show.  It's advertising poster calls it \""the most beautiful topless show in Vegas.\""  I wish I could have read the reviews before I wasted my money. There was nothing spectacular about the show. I can tell that the girls were trying so hard to be dancers which they are not, as well as the singer?  The singer was trying so hard to get a reaction from the crowd but couldn't get none.  The show was not fluid, and there was no continuity. Scenes shifts without something to link them. \n\nMy wife and I wanted to leave but we thought it would be rude to do so. the audience of about 200 people did not warm up to the performers. There was no clapping nor cheering from the audience. The only person clapping was the bartender. Two couples got up in the middle of the show and walked out. \n\nPlease, don't waste your money. I wouldn't have paid over $20 with that kind of performance."
0,"after living in this city for several years i finnaly gave this place a try.  i wish i didnt.  the food was just a greasy slob of mess.  i got their burger, the \""famous\"" one that they are know for.  bleh.  oh and the girls dressed like strippers before the song starts is really not appealing.  if you wear white tank tops, have a mullet, enjoy coors light out of the can, then this might be your place."
0,"I wish Brooklyn Bowl deserved a better rating from me, because in all honesty the idea of it is amazing! However, the service here completely killed the great rating it should have gotten, and instead got a measly 2 stars. \n\nThe first I went to BB was during the first couple of weeks of it's opening. I had gone for a work event and concert, was upstairs in the \""VIP\"" section so I thought the service should've been on top of its game, but it wasn't. Bowling was complimentary, so my party and I picked a lane and looked for our assigned server to assist with getting it started. I had to ask 3 different people, all of which told me they would inform my server to come and help. 45 mins later and no one had showed up to help yet, however, parties in the lanes surrounding us had all been helped (they must have had more attentive servers) Where the hell was our help!? Finally, I saw what seemed to be a manager and asked for help, and then finally some unaware jerk in red came to assist.\n\n---\n\nThe next time I visited was for bowling only. At least this time we were sent up just fine, however forget about trying to get a food/drink order in this place. My friend had placed a drink order twice with our assigned server, which he blatantly ignored and walked away. Finally I had gotten an order in as I saw him taking another persons order, so I had to interrupt and add my order to theirs. After that round of drinks were gone, we tried to find the server again, but it seemed as though he decided to not check up on our lane. I had to ask 3 other servers who walked by to place an order, all which told me they would find my assigned waiter and relay the message. Holy geez, this guy never showed up... for the rest of the freakin' night. I saw him, but he was too busy chatting with the ladies in the lane next to us, instead of doing his job and serving people. \n\nCome on BB management. Get your employees on track. \n\nThe only reason it got 2 stars and not 1 was because the food is delicious, but I'm sure that had nothing to do with the lazy servers I've dealt with thus far."
0,The food is nothing to brag about. I left here and immediately felt sick to my stomach. I went here with a group of people. No one really loved their meal. There was something on my burger and I couldn't tell you what it was. I think it was burnt cheese but I am not sure. The decorations are good service was OK food not so great.
1,Quick professional service. Thank you!!!
1,"ALWAYS come here for happy hour & never had a bad experience. Great prices ( 50% off all tapas from 3-6 everyday... Even weekends ) and friendly service.  Hopefully you get Alan or Casey as your server, because they are both on top of things AND they have remembered our usual order from the past ( which is great for local customers ). Highly recommend this restaurant for any occasion. Hope you all have the same experience I've had!"
1,"WOW!  WOW!  WOW!  Why have we not been to this place before?  Everything and I mean everything we had was amazing. The service was quick and personal. I am a huge eggs Benedict fan and their's is the best I have ever had, hands down!  Bloody Mary's yum!  Hubby had the cornbread rancheros and didn't talk the until they were gone. So they must have been good!  Can't wait to get back here!"
1,"There are two things here that I love that you can't really find anywhere else. The fried rice and the hakata ramen. I know you can find fried rice everywhere, but their's is just ... different. The ramen is my absolute fave ... I find myself craving it all the time. The service can leave something to be desired sometimes, but all the servers are very nice and you can usually tell they're trying. Nice little neighborhood place. :)"
1,I always stop by this place when I stay at the MGM. Especially for lunch. Everything on the menu is usually really great. The service is always on point and one time Emeril was there walking around signing autographs and stuff. Thats Vegas for you.
0,This was my third time here and I am sorry to say that I got food poisoning.  \n\nI ordered Salmon and Pasta.\n\nThis won't stop me for going there though since it's authentic Italian food.
0,"It is frezzing inside and the service is terrible,gave away our order to someone else and then said it would be another 15 min and when we said no they only gave us a partial refund and made us pay for the coffee even thoug we were leaving .they need a lesson in the customer is right"
1,"Total WIne is like a hobby shop for alcoholics. \nI can find everything here including the hard to find RumChata.\nIf you like good whiskey, they feature Midleton for thirty bucks less than other places.\nThe wine and craft beer selection is enormous. \n\nSometimes, I only visit to look at all the vintage Bordeaux wines I can't afford as I fantasize about tunneling from across the way and hiring drug mules to steal them blind. Especially all their Petrus.\nAnd with all that Petrus, I'd have a sweet girlfriend too, maybe Jennifer Aniston.\n\nAnd while I'm at it, I'd steal all their Cristal magnums as well. Then I'd ply Jen with the Cristal in the back of my F-150 and commence to motorboating her sweet hangers.\n\nSometimes, Jen and I would drink it right out of her Jimmy Choo stilettos. Then we'd go downstairs into my dad's basement and play Frogger on our old arcade machine.\nI almost always beat her. \nShe has no Frogger skills.\n\nFive stars for Mexican Xanax.\nFive for Fireball.\nFive for Total Wine.\n\nFive more for Jen. None if she happens to whoop me at Frogger."
1,"The most easy way to have the right job done . By 24/7 electric service , with experience on the trade and a total trust service . I will use again . And I will recommend again."
1,Its really hard to trust people when working with your car. They either upscale you or try to sell you things that you dont need. Joe was true and honest with his price. His work is worth the money spent. As with other reviews on here I WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND DC Window Tint for your cars tinting needs. Thanks again Joe.
1,"Love a hole in the wall that plays good music and has cheap drinks!   Hint:  If heading to a show at the Fillmore or Uptown Ampitheatre, stop in here first and give your wallet a rest!  The drinks are about 75% less expensive!!"

0,"Absolutely terrible customer service. Barely any communication, horrendous people skills. Overall a bad experience that was not worth the money. Leave your table messy so they can spend more time cleaning it. They deserve it."
0,"I should've written a review within the first month of purchasing my pre-owned BMW from Desert Mini of Las Vegas...2012.\n\nThe car I purchased has been the WORST EXPERIENCE I HAVE EVER HAD. Purchasing a new / used car is meant to be exciting. \nThey managed to ruin it and still to this day i have no help being thrown one representative to another. \n\nToday i went in again for service and the 'Warranty' i was also sold doesn't even show in BMW that i am covered (it's Auto Nation accepted). \nAppears the assessor will pick and choose what can and cannot be repaired even though my policy states 'Mechanical' IS COVERED. I signed for it and pay my premium.\n\nI was also promised many things upon purchase, the sales guy 'Mick' came back with a blank sheet stating 'don't worry we will have all those things taken care of after the purchase and didn't need a documented copy'. I took a photo because i sensed this was a sham.\nSince owning the vehicle in 2012 i have not had the items fixed, and sure enough even more problems arose, 2k in repair estimates already. Even after owning it for 3 weeks i had the first installment of problems occur.\nThey practically sell cars that are about to breakdown without qualified inspections. \n\nReading Gina's review made me laugh as i also was promised my car had bluetooth and possible cd rack. Sales guy was hard pressed to move it off the lot he made up things as he went and took me for a ride. \n\nSo disappointed, will never purchase from Auto Nation again. Especially not Desert Mini. \n\nBottom line, do not take their word and have the car inspected at a local mechanic you can rely upon."
0,"Yesterday, we stop in for a late lunch. We decide to split a couple appetizers. While we are waiting they brought us the normal chips and salsa. The chips tasted stale and the salsa was pretty gross too. Then our food came. We ordered loaded nachos - which were far from loaded. I am still trying to figure out how they managed to put everything in one tiny corner of the plate. The second plate was the mini chimis. Oh my gosh, they were even worse! Soggy, covered in sour cream and what I think was guacamole?  They were inedible! Yuck! I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone. No no no"
0,"Dunkin please step it up, I do run on Dunkin like lots of Americans, but you're not my desired 1st choice in Charlotte. While this great location, it was really dirty. I mean like everywhere. I grabbed an ice coffee, I don't think my server had ever made coffee before. My 'coffee' was pure sugar and milk, but that wasn't the worst part. I get workers have off days, but I can't excuse a dirty food establishment- Especially on a slow Sunday afternoon. I went upstairs to grab a sit, but  quickly left because there was food everywhere and it was freezing !"
1,This place is like a popcorn lovers dream! Such good flavors. The owner is very nice and helpful. It's great that you can sample as many flavors as you wish (this makes it hard to pick flavors lol.)  I really love this place I'm glad it's so close to home! My favorite flavor is the cookies and cream. I never would have thought this would be my favorite flavor but it's taste is great and it actually has pieces of cookies! Popcorn is a little expensive but the quality and taste are so good it's worth paying a little more. I hope this place is here for the long haul!
0,"The service is never good but this time we waited 20 minutes for a drink order and 1 1/2 hours for our food.  Chili Rellenos burnt, Torilla Soup a pasty mush and the tacos had no flavor.  The owner was rude and when we asked when we would get our food she said \""That they are very busy and we would just have to wait\""!!  If the owner says that there is no one else to go to for help.  It was a terrible evening.  I am a local and know all the restaurants in the area.  Try somewhere else!"
1,Purple Sunrise Tan is An Amazing Salon and offers the BEST in Uv Tanning and Airbrush tanning
0,"Great, a restaurant that serves organic and gluten free!  But wait.  Sat at the bar, ordered an organic salad.  Came with mixed greens, a small cucumber, some shredded carrots and every other \""add on\"" was minuscule.  The dressing was supposed to be olive oil, garlic and lemon juice.  No lemon taste what so ever.  Just garlic.  Like \""burn your mouth\"" garlic.  AND the mixed greens had several \""old and bad\"" sections that I had to pull out.  Shouldn't the cook have done this before he served it if the greens weren't fresh?  Bottom line, expensive ($15 with tax and tip) and not huge portions of the organic veggies.  I could have bought a bag of organic greens at Trader Joes for 3 bucks and had the same thing!"
0,"We upgraded to a suite with spa in room. When we arrived the jets were non functional. I called house keeping and they communicated to me that the entire hotel had issues with the jets and the engineers were working on it. They referred me back to the front desk to speak with a rep.\n\nI called front desk and talked to a rep named Alex to inform him that the reason we upgraded was for the spa. He said he could not do anything about it and the jets were non functional. I asked to speak to a manager and transferred me to a guy named Peter. Peter challenged me on every aspect of my call with a very rude tone telling me he could not do anything for me and I had to call Vegas.com. After 45 minutes of him arguing with me he told me a different story about the jets not functioning than house keeping so to me this was not very clear and felt cheated and lied to.\n\nTo top it off the room was not clean. There were sunflower seeds scattered all over carpet. The curtains by the spa tub were splashed with wine, ketchup, or blood. I didn't know what it was but was disgusting to look at. The tub was full of hair and some sandy substance and we felt highly disappointed to think this was considered a 4 star hotel. \n\nThe reason we were there is to check out the chapel to have our wedding there and invite all of our friends and family to stay at the Luxor but we decided that with our bad experience with Peter and cleanliness of the room that we would not be coming back ever to this hotel or any affiliated hotel. I mentioned this to Peter that he just lost a huge amount of business for the hotel and he didn't care less of anything I was saying and continued to be as rude as he could be.\n\nThis hotel was really nice like 15 years ago when I originally stayed here but no longer a 4 star hotel and would not recommend it to anyone."
0,"Two stars because I couldn't quite give it three...  We tried this place because we had a coupon and we heard that they had vegetarian options.\n\nThe service was slow and inattentive.  We were seated in a place that seemed to be tucked away almost like they didn't want to have to look at us.  That's alright, but the waiter should have checked in on us a little more instead of just taking it for granted that we would tip him.  Or, maybe he was frightened of us?  \n\nFood was slow in getting to us, but not so slow that I would have walked out.  The music was too loud, it was distracting and made it seem like the wait was longer.  We got to stare at the pretentious decor for a little too long.  But, we figured if the food is good, it doesn't matter too much.  \n\nWe had gluten free pizzas with vegan cheese.  It was okay...they skimped on the vegan cheese horribly.  But, the pizza was hot when we got it so I guess that was a plus.  I was expecting it to be cold because the server seemed to avoid us...or maybe this was because it was so loud and he knew he couldn't hear us or it was hurting his hearing at the spot where we were?  Who knows.\n\nThe pizzas were not large enough.  We ordered two so we could take pizza back to another family member.  Both of us made an effort to stop eating so there would be enough to take with us. \n\nThe WORST part of it was discovering how much the bill was at the end.  This was a very expensive place to eat.  The prices were not clearly marked on the menu for the gluten-free things or I would probably have walked out in the beginning.  We were charged $3 extra for vegan cheese...but as I said they put so little on the pizzas.  So, the little pizzas we ordered ended up being $22 each, the drinks were $6 each, we got an appetizer and we had a $10 off coupon.  For two people to eat a pizza dinner it was $57 AFTER the coupon.  \n\nIt wasn't worth it.  I won't go back.  There's other places to eat.  I don't know if this place thinks it is trendy and that makes it worth it?  I was looking forward to eating there because I heard about it from a few people that went to the other location in Phoenix.  The ambiance didn't make up for any of it.\n\nAnyhow...work on your pricing, work on your service and train your servers to be more attentive, and maybe turn down your music so people can enjoy themselves instead of feeling tortured.  Or maybe this is so people don't linger too long?  But then again if that were it, the food would have come faster?\n\nThe place wasn't all that busy for a Saturday night at 7:30, but finding a place to park was difficult.  \n\nMellow Mushroom needs to work on things a bit.  :)  I know that gluten free, vegan fare is somehow more expensive....but this was a little ridiculous."
0,"It was all right. My boyfriend had a craving for fish and chips, but we were too lazy to drive anywhere. This place delivered, and it delivered fast; about half an hour. The fries were too salty, and the dinner came with three small pieces of fish. I would like to try a pizza off their menu sometime, since those sound good."
0,"A tour guide who has been living in Sedona for over 20 years highly recommended this restaurant to us. So we tried it. My husband was very excited when he heard they had the best steak and seafood.  The prices of the entrees were very high. Almost everything was in the $30 dollar range.  My husband ordered Seabass, my son ordered Gumbo, I ordered salmon and my daughter ordered a cheeseburger.  Honestly, nothing was that great. Just ok. Well, for the price charged, 'just ok\"" isn't good enough. Even the bloody mary wasn't good. Our bill was $122. plus not including tip. I would never return to this restaurant and I wouldn't recommend it to others.  Also, there isn't even a view. For these prices, I would expect at least a view. LOL"
1,"Excellent chips, salsa, and cold beer! Service is friendly and efficient too. \n\nPROS: chips are homemade, light and crispy, and not too oily as some restaurants tend to serve. Love their salsa, as it is just the right amount of spicy and not too chunky.   I had a carne asada chimichanga that was superb: fresh oil used to fry the chimi, and the meat was plentiful and tasty!  Throw in a textbook cheese crisp and a $2.50 pint (maybe 3) of cold Dos Equis, and life is good!\n\nCONS: Jury is out on the guacamole: I'd describe it as creamy, not chunky. This left me a little skeptical, as I like to know there is fresh avocado involved.  \n\nI'm a fan of Rosita's. Service w/ a smile, and they've got the basics down!\n\nCheers!\nRS"
0,"The first time I went, I thought maybe they just had an off day. I wasn't impressed.\n\nIt must have been a year between that first visit and the second. Well, it was during that second visit I remembered why in the hell I waited a year to return.\n\nFirst of all, the service was less than average. I'm all for authentic Mexican food, but my server was so difficult to understand, and understand me, I was wondering if I actually had been transported south of the border.\n\nIt was NOT busy when we were there, but we were constantly looking for someone to help with the many issues we had during our meal. \n\nThey screwed up my kids burrito, (how tough is it to NOT serve it enchilada style).\n\nMy other son ordered beef tacos, he loves tacos, took one bite and was like YUCK! I said seriously, it can't be that bad, so I - being the dad who was raised not to waste food took a taste. - YUCK is right. How can you screw up ground beef? Well, I suppose if you can't serve a burrito plain, ground beef is way to tough to cook and season properly.\n\nI ordered off the healthy menu and the piece of meat that came out on my plate would have made a nice treat for my Labrador, but not for me. Now maybe it was because I waited 5 minutes before trying my steak that caused it to suck so bad - but I was hoping to get my son a new meal, (which never happened btw) because by the time the waiter came back, my boy was so stuffed on chips and salsa, he didn't want anything else.\n\nAND - the drinks were never refilled or topped off. AND - they didn't even offer to take the tacos off my bill. Hmmm. Customer satisfaction 101 me thinks???\n\nAll in all, I will NOT be going back here. El Palacio means the Palace...in my judgement, the King and Queen need to get their kingdom in order."
1,"Tasty French Roast coffee? Super cool and friendly staff (this time)? AND not many hipsters clogging up the inside? Man oh man this is WAY more my speed.\n\nI sat in a corner sipping my coffee (and guiltily chowing down on a cranberry muffin) and retaking in the place. Sure, the walls still had ears (and some overpriced artwork), but I actually could sit and think and write. Then about 30 minutes later, one of my friends dropped in and some of the stories she was telling I could tell the MacBook guy was listening quite intently.\n\nWhile sitting in there, I heard The Decemberists, Temper Trap, and a bunch of other Leanne-approved alternative bands. Definitely an improvement of last time too.\n\nThank you Smelly Cat for a pleasant experience, I'll be back!\n\n(oh yeah, and Props for the Yelp sign at the counter AND the one on the door!)"
0,"I went on a Thursday night before Alive after 5 - it was empty, although our waiter was attentive, he was inexperienced and made some novice mistakes. \nThe food is just ok. I had the scallop entree - pretty good but not worth the price. The place is beautiful and convenient to alive after 5 but I will not be returning."
1,"My wife and I loved this place. Fried chicken, awesome. Rice, lobster asparagus and black truffle, to die for. Suzie, the server, new the answer to everything. Managers all working the room. Talking to, and helping with service. Don't miss the Ginger bread Pudding for dessert. Good stuff here."
1,"I was introduced to five guys burgers during one of my many trips up to Chandler Blvd. The burgers come in two sizes, a double and a single. All of the toppings are free and the options are plentiful. The soda machines are the new touch screen type with lots of different flavors. The burgers are always juicy and delicious although I could stand for them to be a little bigger. The real reason why I will continue to return are the fries. OMG these are probably the best fries I've had since I had Thrasher's Fries on the boardwalk of Ocean City MD. If you put ketchup on these fries you are missing the point entirely. Vinegar is provided on the condiment table and takes the fries to the next level. As a word of advice, the small order of fries is more than enough for two people. Save your money and share a small order. \n\nThis brings me to the only real negative...the prices. I am aware that if you want a quality burger you will pay for it, but when my wife and I get a burger each, a small fry to share and two drinks and it comes to 20 dollars, something is wrong. I'm never full when I leave and it seems like I should be after spending 20 bucks for lunch. \n\nDefinitely worth checking out though if you're a burger/fries fan."
0,"I just moved to Vegas and had been watching Holly's World since the beginning so I could not wait to see Peepshow! I'm a HUGE FAN of Holly, Josh, (and Angel too!)\n\nMy review is bitter sweet. Josh is the real star of the show. Holly has no talent, she does nothing except show her boobs twice.  I caught myself yawning like 5 times. \n\nDO NOT PAY FOR MEET AND GREET. This was the biggest waste of money ever. My husband was sweet enough to surprise me with meeting her and it was very disappointing. She was wearing a pink baggy SWEAT SUIT with her hair in a BUN.  Ok people, why do I look better than Holly? I was expecting her to come out in costume at least so I could have a cute picture.  Everyone gathers at the front of the stage, you wait for her to come out, toast some champagne, stand in line and wait for your turn for her to say \""who do I sign the photo to\"" and you get one shot with your camera.   I was really bummed, I wish Josh would have come out instead!  I GOT A BETTER PICTURE WITH THE POSTER IN THE LOBBY!\n\nHolly clearly did not want to be there, she looked bored and was totally fake. The show needs to end too, she was just going through the motions........"
1,"I bought a Groupon awhile back and when they came out, I got what I paid for. Sometimes I think that people think that because they paid \""$35\"".....\""OMG you spent how much?!!!!\"",   that they should get the world. Remember people, you get what you pay for.  After my initial clean via the Groupon, I've had Pristine back 2 or three times a month. My wife is happy.....I'm happy.  I'd recommend them."
0,"I love Jimmy John's and I usually go to the one by my house on Windmill and Eastern.  I was Christmas shopping at Galleria Mall and was craving a sandwich so I looked online to see when the Jiimmy John's across from the mall closes, 9pm, great I can make it. I walked in at 8:39 pm and it looked liked they were already closed! I asked an employee if they were closed already and he stammered \""well, umm, yeah, we're closed already!\"" I said \""Really?!!!\""  I just walked out, annoyed!"
0,"If you think this place has good beer, you shouldn't judge beer ever again!\n\nThis place is horrible IMO. The food was bland and unappealing. Had a burger and tater tots which was one of my least favorite meals in recent history. Tried several beers which were equally unimpressive. I wouldn't go back and wouldn't recommend to anyone. Only thing I liked about this place was the atmosphere/decor. \n\nCliff notes: bad food, bad beer, decent atmosphere."
0,I had initially wanted to consign items here and had nothing but poor service and continued trouble with staff in addition to be very poor in communicating with me. I would not consign anything or buy anything here. I consign many unneeded items and have never had such poor customer service from staff and management. They are very unwilling to go extra mile for customers in addition to being rude. I am completely disappointed in my decision to choose this store. I will be consigning elsewhere and suggest others do as well!\n\nI agree with a previous reviewer staff is cold and there is junk all over store and way overpriced! Agreed! Mis-managed:(
1,"I have never had extensions.  I have received recommendations on a few other places but I came across this lounge on a whim. \n\nI went inside just to \""check it out\"" and was pleasantly surprised by two women at the counter who did not try to upsell me on any product or try to get me in the door with pressure.  I listened to what they had as options and felt a good \""vibe\"" about this place.\n\nI bit the bullet and decided to go for it.  I had Gesmerelda ? who consulted with me about the different types of lashes and also about the style that would fit my lifestyle (I teach fitness classes).  Like I said prior, no upselling!!! I actually started with Sweetheart to test out how my sweat will affect lashes.  \n\nThe lounge is relaxing with soothing music and the most comfortable recliner chairs. It takes two hours but the time flew by!! I was so relaxed.  I love the final product and they feel totally natural.  I was advised of the care required and if I had any questions.\n\nI have never had lashes before and I will update progress of durability in the next couple of weeks (I was told with my lifestyle to expect a fill in 2-3 weeks).\n\nBased on my initial experience, I would highly recommend this lounge."
1,"Good food, friendly service, but the speed of service could use some work."
1,"What a great experience! I love the feel of being right on the ranch. Sitting outside was wonderful. We shared the 3 piece Pulled Pork, Pulled Chicken & Tri tip with potato salad, beans & cornbread. My husband and I will definintely go back. I highly recommend this place if you are a BBQ lover!!"
0,"We used to come here often because it's close to downtown, open late, and had vegan pizza. But after a few weeks of not going, we went last night and found out that they no longer carry vegan cheese and don't make vegan pizzas. This is a big disappointment and we won't be going back."
0,"This company is not run very well, it NEEDS TO PAY THEIR BILLS...enough said..."
0,"I was very disappointed in the food here, especially for what I paid for it. I ordered the stuffed pepper (for lack of better term) that was supposed to have meat, rice, cheese along with a few other things. And all I got was a pepper stuffed with rice and a few scraps of meat. I was hoping they would redeem themselves with dessert. They said all their deserts fed two easily, and for 9 bucks I would hope so. So we ordered the fried icecream. And got a small scoop of fried icecream drowning in whipped cream. So basically paid $9 for whipped cream. Very disappointed and never going back or recommending this place to anyone ever."
0,"We had family in town for the holidays and we wanted to take them somewhere special. The reviews came in positive, so we decided to try the notorious pink pony.we thought the food was below average, not worth the money we paid. The rib eye steak was good not great, the sides were blah. To sum up our experience !! I will never ever eat there again, I won't even recommend to my worst enemy. 2 thumbs down !!!!"
1,Amazing new york style pizza restaurant.  I have no idea why they hide this in a alley between the sushi and mexican restauarent\n\nGreat taste!
1,"When a cold hits and the fuzziness sets in, all I want is soup and grilled cheese. Well, I find some great soup here! They have some of the best tomato basil around and it comes with a nice cheesy piece of bread. This combination is perfect for a cold day or a stuffy nose day!"
1,"Needed two Palo Verde trees thinned and trimmed.  Received a call back less than 24 hours after leaving a message.\n\nThe estimator showed up the following day, and presented a very fair estimate for the job.\n\nThe crew (Dave and Luis) showed up 2 days later to do the job.  I have to say they did an outstanding job.  Trees look great.  They were very knowledgeable and meticulous in their work.  They literally swept their way off of my property.\n\nHighly recommend!"
1,"Walked in not expecting much from a chain restaurant like HRC, but I was actually quite surprised on how good the food was. Staff very friends and service was great. Fun atmosphere, with a great location and view of the strip. Worth checking out"
1,"Best food served fast in terminal 4 concourse B near gate B9- I have had the Napa Salad for lunch and the breakfast burrito for breakfast here and both were excellent.  They also make great cappucinos.  Most of the restaurants in this terminal all had salads premade in plastic boxes that looked identical.  Press Coffee made the salad fresh and it was outstanding.  Furthermore, the staff was friendly and helpful, which was the reason I first ate there, after waiting a long time at the place next door for a cashier that did not appear happy to be at her post."
0,"The wife, baby and I stopped in for Brunch this past Sunday due to my friends kept raving about this place.  Upon entering the cloth curtains, the room was 75% full. In the room we were in, there were only two waiters waiting on everyone and we stood for 5 minutes unnoticed.  The bartender to the right didn't bother to greet us either.   It felt awkward and after noticing many customers still waiting to be served, we figure it'll be a long wait since they're under staffed.  It was a dissapointing first impression.  Maybe we'll return again in the spring and hopefully they'll be better staffed."
0,"This review is not about the baked goods. I am reviewing the \""bistro\"" here. The \""bakery\"" is fine.\n\nThe sandwiches here are so obscenely over-priced. I don't understand how they manage to make everything so plain and unappetizing. I ordered a \""ham and cheese melt\"" that had ham and melted cheese on sourdough. The sourdough was vaguely stale and warm, but it was not clear that it had been toasted. The cheese had been melted on the bread, not the meat; there was a single, sad slice that didn't even cover all of the sourdough. The ham was overly salty, cut thick. Nothing else comes on the sandwich -- the bread isn't clearly buttered, pressed, or anything. No condiments. Just generally unappetizing. In retrospect I should have asked for a refund.\n\nThis is the most recent sandwich disappointment. I don't think I'll make the mistake of getting anything that isn't pure sugar again."
1,"Very friendly staff, store is clean and well stocked."
1,"I have been taking my Shihtzu, Charlie to Danielle since I got him.  She does a super, great job on him.  I took pictures in with me to show her what look I was hoping to get on Charlie and when I picked him up, he looked perfect!  Sometimes taking pictures can help avoid any confusion on what kind of cut you are looking for.  The only reason I gave four stars instead of five is for their hours.  I wish they had more convenient hours.  I would recommend this groomer."
1,I love Italian. Nothing like homemade Italian food. The owner came out and introduced him self made me feel at home and important. He gave me a glass of Sangria wine which i think is like their signature drink. Pizza is unlike anything else around. It is OK to bring your kids into this restaurant. many families here. I love it. Thanks Mario and family.
1,"The location of the store was great, as it's conveniently located in Town Square with so many different stores around. \n\nThe store was large and like most Whole Foods it had most things I was looking for. The only reason we actually came here was because I got really sick right before out weeklong stay in Vegas and I needed some natural remedies to take care of my stomach ailments. \n\nThe customer service was amazing here. A lady in the vitamin section knew exactly what I needed to help me \""cure\"" whatever was going on with me. Her suggestions helped immensely and without her advice, I'm not sure I'd have enjoyed my time in Vegas. I wish I knew her name but it was nice to know someone was so knowledgeable in exactly the department they worked in."
0,According to the director of customer service the guy with the foreign accent asked us if we were cowgirls.  So I guess when my friend completely freaked out on him about the call girl thing he didn't understand.  Thats still really lame.  Learn English please!
1,"Awesome tacos, but I wish they still came one at a time. I wouldn't be upset if they had pizza too... Nice variety of beers on tap, karaoeke isn't as good as it used to be but is still entertaining and free. Cheap. All in all, I'm glad it's my neighborhood bar."
0,"Went here to try to tell clothes back. All the girls that work here seemed to dress skimpily and \""trendy\"", have blue (or some unnatural color) hair. If that gives you an idea as to what to anticipate. I didn't browse the whole store but there seemed to be a lot of short shorts and Abercrombie on the racks.\n\nThey told me that are not \""brand biased\"" and I was surprised when they x-nayed more expensive designer pieces for forever 21 and less expensive brands.\n\nAs expected, out of a bag of 40 items they took about 7 and I got 26 dollars. Hmpf. Make sure you run through the receipt so you know what you get for each piece. They almost got away with and $80 shirt for $2.80."
0,"I've tried this place once before..had d Gyro with d white sauce added top of d meat. 2nd time the meat was bland, sauce on d side. Driving off d Hwy I've seen their big poster advertising their Gyro with the white sauce on top..coming from NY where I've had n enjoy Gyro sandwiches all d time the sauce is on top of meat along with all the only stuff that goes with d sandwich..Why on d side? I won't b eating at this place ever again..can't get past d bland tasting meat..sauce on d side no big deal..But..why not b authentic n add it to d sandwich the way it shld b done..I guess I of cld told them to add d sauce onto d sandwich lik it was done w/d first Gyro sandwich I ever had there. Taking it to go d 2nd time it was on d side..took a taste of d sauce-less meat..it had no flavor...really bland..it needs that sauce big time..Will I go back? Nope..looking for a new n better tasting Gyro place.."
0,"I loooooooove Fuzzy's!!!....until today! I have a huge family. I ordered 8 steak tacos and 8 fish tacos and chips with guacamole. Tyler took my order and refused my military discount, claiming because it was a Tuesday there weren't any extra discounts because Tacos were a $1.50.   Now I have been coming to Fuzzy's every Tuesday since I moved here from Ohio and use my military discount.  I'm familiar with the owner who is a Michigan fan!! He teases my son's for wearing OSU gear!!! Tyler was rude loud and obnoxious, refused to add my discount and shoved my receipt in my face and said \""Look lady I'm not giving you a discount, do you want me to get fired\"" The manager was not there but Westin , I'm assuming was taking the managerial position for the day, stepped in.  He assisted us with a smile, was cordial and added my discount. Meanwhile, Tyler stomped away from the cashier station pouting! Terrible customer service...terrible example of empathy!! Tyler makes Fuzzy a place I never want to come back to!!!  Thank you Westin for all of your help and for keeping Fuzzy's onTuesday regular for us!!!"
1,"Taggia is located in the Firesky Resort and Spa. My relatives and I came to Taggia's for an authentic Italian cuisine. Our table was in a semi private dining room. On the table, there was a tea light candle within a candle holder. On one of the walls in the dining room, there was cabinet with a bowl of decorative grapes and a large wall mirror behind it. Our server (Seth) was wonderful. He offered great suggestions for appetizers, entrees, and desserts.\n\nThe server brought us two baskets of bread that consisted of a white roll topped with sesame seeds and a wheat roll. It came with two dipping sauces - balsamic vinaigrette and extra virgin olive oil. \n\nFor drinks, I'd recommend a bottle of The Crossings - 2014 Sauvignon Blanc from Awatere Valley, Marlborough. The Arnold Palmer which consisted of freshly squeezed lemonade and freshly brewed ice tea and garnished with a lemon slice. \n\nFor appetizers, I'd recommend the Mista, Crudo, and Calamari. The Mista consisted of organic greens (spring mix and baby spinach), golden and red beets, and porcini soil smoked goat cheese tossed in a truffle-honey vinaigrette. The beet salad was light and refreshing. I liked how the truffle in the vinaigrette was not overpowering. The goat cheese was silky smooth. The Crudo consisted of pepper crusted ahi tuna, cooked medium rare, served over red pepper/celery salsa, and topped with black olive gremolata, radish, and lemon. The Calamari consisted of marinated chilled squid salad, topped with avocado mousse, marcona almonds, crispy pancetta, celery, carrots, red radish, and parsley. I think the Calamari was marinated in lime juice.\n\nFor entrees, I'd recommend Pesce Spada, Branzino Striato, Capesante, and Spaghetti Bolognese. The Pesce Spada consisted of grilled, tender swordfish, cut into three pieces, cooked to medium to medium well, served in sweet carrot pur\u00e9e with seasoned organic baby carrots, roasted white corn, avocado salsa (avocado, red onions, cilantro, parsley), drizzled with caper gremolata, and garnished with braised thyme leaves. The Branzino Striato consisted of pan seared striped bass, cut into two pieces, stacked one on top of the other, served in pea pur\u00e9e with braised kale and quinoa, and garnished with an artichoke vinaigrette. I liked how the artichoke vinaigrette was subtle. The Capesante consisted of three seared jumbo sea scallops served over a creamy risotto with asparagus, caper, and herbs. The Spaghetti Bolognese consisted of thin spaghetti covered in a marinara sauce with ground beef and garnished with melted Parmesan, freshly grated parsley, and roasted tomatoes. The kid at the table ordered a Hawaiano pizza but substituted the jalape\u00f1o for bacon. The pizza had tomato sauce, mozzarella cheese, smoked ham, crispy bacon, and large pickled pineapple. The pizza looked delicious but I couldn't try it due to my pork allergy. \n\nFor dessert, I'd recommend Tiramisu and Zabaglione. The Tiramisu consisted of a dark chocolate crust, mascarpone cheese, and lady fingers and topped with a warm chocolate sauce. The Zabaglione consisted of a light lavender infused Italian cream served with mixed berries (blackberries, strawberries, blueberries) and topped with cocoa nibs. The cocoa nibs gave the dish a nutty flavor. The kid at the table ordered a mixed berries sorbet which came in three scoops. \n\nFor teas, they have a variety of Mighty Leaf teas. I ordered an Earl Grey with Half and Half and Sugar. The steeped loose leaf tea came in a red Forlife teapot and a yellow mug.\n\nIt was a great dining experience. I highly recommend this place to others!!!"
1,"Stopped in the afternoon of Boxing Day while visiting from the USA. Enjoyed a few glasses of wine while chatting with a friendly and helpful staff and manager. Didn't eat, other than a great bowl of squash and spinach soup, and some warm, crusty bread. A very enjoyable and relaxing refuge from the cold Canadian afternoon. Wine drinkers and fans of French bistros should check it out."
0,"Stayed at Palms couple of weeks ago. Late night went to check out the place and grab a quick bite but guess what? Big sign in front saying, \""sorry closed\"". Not so 24 seven!"
0,If I didn't like how close this place was to my house or the giant selection of fabrics I would give it zero stars! The customer service is horrendous!  the people that work there are the rudest people I've ever seen in my entire life at a store. That's all
1,"I am constantly on a quest for a great used book store.  I'd passed by this little place a few times, and one day I finally went inside.  The first moment I walked in the door, my senses flooded with the scent of old books (one of my favorite scents on the planet, strange as that is).  \n\nThey really have a pretty large selection of books, which was surprising given the size of the store.  They had a greatly blend of fiction and nonfiction.  I appreciate that they had it laid out in narrower categories than many used book stores I've been to in the past.\n\nJust one minor complaint so far.  Some categories of fiction novels were intertwined in shelves that I assumed at first glance were nonfiction.  It made it a little difficult to find some of the categories of fiction books.  \n\nI'll definitely be returning here in the foreseeable future."
1,"Awesome!!! I moved from Miami like 2 month ago and tried different places in Pittsburgh and was disappointed. Now I found my spot! Fast, clean, beautiful and not expensive. I love it. Lucy did a great job, you can see on the picture I posted. I'm gonna come back again and again for sure. Don't waste your time and money, come here and ask for Lucy. Great job! I love it love it love it!!! You made my day!!!! Thanx a lot!!!!"
0,Ok definitely the worst restaurant I have been to in Scottsdale!!!  The service is slow!!!! They messed up every single item we ordered. The restaurant had a terrible draft and the food was mediocre. \nI would never ever go here again!  Many better options for Mediterranean food in Scottsdale. A definite add to the must miss list. Blech.
0,"This place refused to to take a gift certificate.  Never had that happen before. They offered to give me 20% off my bill, but geez what a bunch of sleezebags!  I guess they've gone way downhill since they were Minuto's.  There are much better options in LV, so don't waste your time."
1,"Have been here several times now and they are consistently great. They really do put the other place I used to go to to shame!  So glad to have found a place you can trust, who do a good job with great prices too."
0,"I'm just gonna have to stop and call this place out.\n\nFirst, I typically love $2 tacos. I'm all about that. But this place is scum.\n\nWe waited in line for 20 minutes. Not because the guy was helping another customer...no he was replacing cheese that didn't need to be replaced. It was like half full. Second,  after he replaced the cheese he stuck some in his mouth and started eating it with his gloved hands. After the cheese he decided the ketchup bottles needed replacing too. All the while me and everyone behind me are watching this guy and getting more and more pissed.\n\nAfter we called him out on that to change his gloves after sticking it in his mouth he decided to be a jerk and stick the hottest salsa they have on our tacos. I asked for mild, not suicide hot. Couldn't even eat my damn taco.\n\nI am so pissed."
0,"This place was so packed on a Friday night we have to wait an hour and half for a table. No, we didn't show up at 8 p.m. we strolled in around 5:30.\n\nWe bought some drinks while we waited for our table but they were way too expensive. We played some pool while we waited but it was too crowded to get a good shot off. We finally left after two hours because our table wasn't ready and the other group we came with had been seated and started eating.\n\nDon't go late at night."
1,Customer service is great. However I come here all of the time. They need someone outside taking orders. Here now and people are pulling out of the line going next door to del taco.
1,"Lots of random ass shit that I don't think anyone ever needs, but regardless, they have it. I like walking around the little kitchen setups they got cause I think they're fun and give me ideas on how to make my house not look like shit.\n\nAll in all, if you need it, they most likely have it. I visit a lot for gardening stuff, even though I totally fail at it, I try."
0,"Wow, I really liked the folks here, and they did pack my item well. However, the international shipment I was sending was based on size and not weight, the box they chose would have cost me and extra 250.00 in shipping had I not taken the package home cut the box down and repacked it."
0,"I stayed here for 4 days August 11, 2014. \n1. We got to check in 4 hours early. \n2. We got a $15 food credit.\n3. The location is awesome downtown.\n4. The rooms were average. \n5. There was a water main break that flooded and dampened at least 6 floors by the soda machines in the hall. They put fans out which didn't really seem to help. It smelled like mildew and forget walking around without tennis shoes. \n6. I tried to get a drink out of a soda machine late at night when I woke up thirsty. I seriously tried 10 floors before one took my dollar and ate it. I walked all the way to the opposite side of the casino to tell the front desk and they told me to walk all the way back upstairs at 3am to get my id. \n7. They had a brand new ultimate texas Holdem table. I was their very first customer ever on the game. I had to ague with 2 pit bosses and a dealer that I still get paid on the play if the dealer doesn't qualify. I was right come to find out. It pissed me off that they were trying to act like they knew when I know for a fact they were wrong. \n8. Not enough outlets in the room. You really have to search. \n9. Beds were very comfortable, blanket was soft, and the ac was epic.\n10. I don't think I would stay here again because I want to experience other hotels and this one just did not go the distance for me to give it another chance with the other options out there."
0,Average Japanese food at amazing Japanese food prices.
0,Food was good but expensive for the amount of food you get. No prices at all so you basically guessing. No soft drink just three kids of drinks and fridge with cold drinks. Overall not satisfied 30 bucks on two lunch meals and three pupusas. Too much oh and also no menus at all!!!!
1,I haven't had any of the issues with this location that previous reviewers have had. My drinks have consistently been made correctly and they have great customer service. I bring my dog here (thank you drive-thru) and they always fawn over him which makes me a proud puppy parent :) Will return!
1,"Well, I asked a random employee in the restaurant \""donde esta el ba\u00f1o,\"" and was answered in Spanish, so that's a good sign. We tried the four salsa sampler, and all four were \""muy delicioso\"" and the chips were nicely done as well. I ordered a house margarita which was pretty tasty and came out with a huge extra portion for me to refresh my glass from. Muy bueno. The chicken enchiladas were good, although the meat was a little on the tough side. Still, the sauces were great, and my dinner companions enjoyed their meals as well. Service was friendly and our waitress even anticipated when we'd need more chips and brought them without asking. My only complaint is that the kitchen smoke from cooking occasionally filled the dining area with smoke, so they should really ventilate that a bit more. Overall, a very positive experience - I'll be back."
0,"I felt taken advantage of. I also didn't like that they just are terrible with up keep. I kept having to ask for stuff that should have been there. They just don't pay attention. Steam room had water coming out from the bottom of the door I almost slipped twice and hurt my ankle.  I moved from California and was a regular at a well known spa there, I guess I have to keep looking. I really wish this would have worked for me. I didn't get my full facial, the lady who gave me the facial must have thought I didn't read what came with my facial. *sigh* so upsetting."
1,"I had close to a 18 inch crack in my front windshield. Initially took it to Safelite and the quote to replace the entire windshield was pretty high. I shopped around Yelp and found Mike's, who quoted me roughly $100 less than Safelite so I gave him a try. \n\nI had no problems scheduling the appt, which I later had to reschedule. He was very accommodating to my schedule. There was no extra charge for him to come out to my condo and replace my windshield. It's been 3 weeks and I've found no issues with the work. Would highly recommend."
0,"We usually stay at the wynn/venetian however we got a great rate and decided to give it a try. Upon checking in I requested a room with a king size bed and was told they were out and to try back tomorrow. When we got to our room it was rather beat up for only being open six months. The housekeeping staff really needs to get it together here. No coffee for the coffee maker, safe was broken(but fixed when we called down), shower gel was opened and 3/4th full......The next day we went down to the pool to layout. We went to the bar and asked if we could order breakfast and was told we couldn't order food until 11am. It was 9:45 so we went inside to the coffee shop(the only place to get breakfast besides the buffett) and got some fruit and coffee to take back to the pool. On our way back to the pool a man said we weren't allowed to take food out to the pool!!! After some persuasion he allowed us to take our food out. After the pool we decided to see if we could move to a room with a king size bed. I went down to the lobby and and spoke with the man about the room issues and he was super nice and understanding and upgraded us to a beautiful suite overlooking the bellagio fountains on the 63 floor. Wahoo things were turning around..so we thought. The new room was beautiful with a few mishaps from the housekeeping staff again. No robes, doorknob broken on bathroom door ahhhh...Also the people that answered the phone here and that worked in the EAT shop were rude too. It's like half of the people at the cosmo went through customer service training while the other half were hire from mcdonalds down the street. Needless to say we will not be returning to the cosmo again....."
1,"Don't let the name fool you, not one dish on the menu has elephant in it, and even when you ask they don't have any off the menu. \n\nDue to the lack of elephant I went with my new thai usual, Drunken noodles with tofu. (7.95) with soup and a veggie spring roll. The soup was good and very strong from copious amounts of ginger. My noodles were good, but they were the premade style noodle, the wide variety of vegetables and texture of tofu really made this dish shine, I really like the skinny green beans and thai basil.  The springroll was a bit cool and soggy, I think this is what we get for coming a bit late for lunch. The portion size was quite good, making the higher price acceptable.\n\nThere are a surprising amount of tables inside this small store front, and they can even accommodate larger groups as the many tables of 2 can be become tables for 2 4 6 8 or any number you can appreciate.\n\nThis is one of the few non chain places for lunch in the heart of down town, and its good too, give it a try, it can even work for a business lunch as it was not too loud and decent inside."
0,"In my 60 years on this earth,  Clear wireless phone, internet and usb modem service is the worst company I've ever done business with!  The left hand does not communicate with the right hand and they have too many problems to mention.  At least they are letting me out of my contract and some of their own employees are aware of their disfunctional issues.  They don't deserve any stars at all, yet at least one was required."
1,"Yeah, it's kind of touristy, but I'll admit that I love Station Square.  There is always something going on here.  My husband the train fan loves to sit along the CSXT Railway tracks and watch the frieght trains go by.  Some of my favorite stores include Hometown Sports, where you can get that sports fan anything Pittsburgh-related.  Morini features Italian-themed wear, although they used to have automotive wear too.  Pennsylvania Wine Cellars is a good place to find local wines for the wine-enthusiast in your life.  And SW Randall's is a classic toy shop.\n\nThey have since built-up Bessemer Court with all of the famous chain restaurants, but if you can eat there in your hometown, why eat them when you're visiting?  I love Sesame Inn for its wonderful Chinese Cuisine and the Melting Pot is famous for its cheese fondues.\n\nOh, and my husband loves the clothes at Heinz Healy's."

0,"I've never reviewed a flat out franchise before, but I feel compelled to because I've never been to a TGI Friday's before and, more importantly, I have too much time on my hands.\n\nNo, I didn't go to Vegas to eat at TGI Friday's. We really weren't feeling that long buffet line though. We were seated quickly and a server came out of nowhere and yelled \""Hey HEY hey.\"" Scared the hell out of me. I look at the menu and, unsurprisingly, most of that shit has meat in it. Even the salad! They chop up chicken and bacon in that shit. Mannn. I end up ordering this big ass potato with sauteed veggies in it. The heaviest vegetarian meal I've ever eaten. Pretty salty and really oily. Not really a complain, just something I noticed. \n\nServer was fine, food was adequate, I guess. I'll probably never come back. There's gotta be better restaurants in Las Vegas that aren't in smoke-filled casinos."
1,"Blended mocha is awesome!! Made my Monday. Friendly staff, comfy decor."
1,"Probably my favorite Chinese place. Went here on my birthday recently, and loved it.\n\nWe got the dumplings and pork ribs for appetizers, then the pork fried rice and mongolian beef for entrees. Everything was great, especially the dumplings and pork. Really, the pork is the star here, and you need to get it in one form or another.\n\nThe ambiance is fancy, so the price reflects that. Yeah, you can probably get 75% of the quality for 60% of the cost elsewhere, but hey, you're in Vegas. And truth be told, the bill is pretty reasonable compared to other fine dining options in town.\n\nService is absolutely impeccable, by the way. Very attentive but they don't smother you at all."
1,"Dear Yelp, it's official: I AM 21. :D\n\nFor my 21st birthday, I spent the night at a room here. I must say, quite a fun place to spend a 21st birthday at!\n\nRoom: HUGE. To begin with, it was already in the older tower and yet it was still quite impressive. Two comfortable beds, a couch, a chair, a table/mini-office space and a fridge....it was almost like a miniature apartment. The view was also quite amazing, looking right over the pool and straight at the Strip. Oh, and it had a fridge, a plus seeing I needed to have refreshments for the get-together I was having.\nService: Can't really say, we were just partying it up in there. \nLocation: Not on The Strip, but close enough, with free shuttle service to Harrahs and Ballys. \nPool: It was amazing with a bold, capital A. Crowded, but not overwhelmingly so. Beautiful people all around, and not overrun with the douchebags you see so much of at somewhere like, say, the Palms or Mandalay Bay pool areas. One cheesy, but cool touch was the waterfall that came out of a clam. \nMiscellaneous: As great as the room was, I was charged a security deposit of $50 that I had no way of knowing about beforehand. At least it wasn't a blasted resort fee, but still.\n\nThe Final Verdict:\n\nPros:\nMore than enough space.\nFridge in the room.\nLovely view.\nEpic pool.\nFree shuttle to the Strip.\nNice enough bathroom. \nOffered two free passes to the Voodoo Lounge.\nLots of things to do on the property.\nGot the room for a pretty sweet price as well ($53.00).\n\nCons:\nSneaky security deposit. It's refunded when you check out but still. \n\nSuggestions: Please let people know about the security deposit in advance. So next time someone wants to have their birthday there they won't be $50 short on drinking and partying funds. \n\nWould I stay here again? I'd stay here again just for that pool."
1,"1 star for going on a weekend (Sunday) never ever again, 5 stars for the food. They need at least 3 more extra waiters on the weekends. took forever for our food at least 1 hour and 10 mins. kept forgetting everything down to the silverware. but very pleasant girls, Owner only hires pretty females (discrimination) too tight inside, nice outside but flimsy patio chairs., and neighborhood pidgeons walking up to your feet looking for hand-outs. haha. Went inside to get a carry-out box and the waitress picked up 2 plates full of un-eaten food and discarded it. Oh well cant cry over spilled milk. Stay out of restaurants in \nVegas on the weekends, nobody friggin cooks at home....."
1,Solid by Marriott standards.  Concierge loung was open for breakfast on weekends.  Fitness ctr good.  Walkable to south park mall and restaurants.
1,I loved everything about my visit to Joe's Farm Grill! I ordered the Fontina Burger. It was lovely and fresh. The food is made with quality ingredients in a casual atmosphere. We sat at the picnic tables under the trees with fragrant orange blossoms. The weather was gorgeous and it felt so relaxing and calming. I loved the change of pace and scenery. We did not want to leave.
0,"First time trying this restaurant, and we won't be back. It took 45 minutes to get breakfast. Water glasses were not refilled, and we weren't asked if we wanted another pot of coffee. The potatoes were lukewarm/cold and hard as bricks. The egg dish was OK. My husband said his biscuits were hard. Not worth the time or money to return when better places are nearby."
0,"I like the place, in general. Very low-key, hole-in-the-wall-type place. When I went there was a cool art exhibit, but I gotta say...... the wait staff is horrible! The waitress acted like everything was on her time despite the fact that the bar was mostly empty. Ans who was she so busy gabbing with to bring our drinks? Why, the bartender of course. And even if we went to the bar to order, we had to wait just as long to get our next drink.\nOn a plus side, there's a sweet phone booth inside that's perfect for changing into your superhero outfit and round housing the bar staff."
1,My son in law is from Poland and I have experience good Polish food.  This place is close to the top.  I had the veal cutlet with beet salad.  It was amazing.  Kielbasa for appetizer was great as well.  A good wine selection and the service was very good.  Highly recommend.
1,"Felt like I was in a great bistro in Paris for the locals.  Not touristy at all and the wild menu items were great.  A bit out of the way, but cabbie got us there fast.  Loved the foie gras poutine for a started and bison tongue.  This was great peasant food, not for snobs, so right up our alley and this also felt like a neighborhood place, not artsy-fartsy.  Sometimes you don't need fancy to enjoy a great meal.  Everyone around us seemed happy and I'm glad we followed the hotel's advice and went early.  It is a usual old city bistro in that it is small and when it gets busy, it's really cramped.  If you want space, get out of the old city and go to something new.  This isn't for you.  Everything we had was fresh and they were receiving vegatables from a farmer while we were there, nothing wrong with that - especially if you're into local and fresh."
0,"Came here and loved the name. It should be really good food. It was ok. It's hard for me to find a Korean place to love when I have so many in the city so I might be biased. \n\nOrdered the seafood tofu soup (looks nothing like the pictures on the menu) and got a bibimbap for my mom. \n\nThe assortment of ban chan was pitiful compared to a lot of restaurants in San Francisco. It came with four dishes and it wasn't too tasty.\n\nThe soup was really good, but it had more tofu than seafood... Wish there was more seafood for sure! \n\nMy mom's bibimbap was good to her. She didn't care too much for it though. The portion size wasn't really worth what they charged. \n\nNot on my list for Vegas visits."
1,"Went late night and was the only table in the place, good service the duck was very good tender with crispy skin and also pan friend noodles with beef were good too. Would go back again."
1,"I have found it! The Blue Bear is officially now my favourite breakfast and brunch place in Edinburgh. There is stiff competition out there, but coming to the Blue Bear is an all-around fantastic experience.\n\nLet's start with the food. I love breakfast and, particularly, waffles and pancakes since I not only love the taste (including the great syrups, fruit or bacon you can add) but I also have fond memories of my Dad making waffles for us on weekend mornings. The Blue Bear is a fantastic locals' place and a family place that is buzzing with activity and diners eagerly awaiting their delicious meals or baked goods or coffees. I had the waffles with berry compote and my merry brunch companions had the full breakfast and eggs benedict. The full breakfast was absolutely huge, but it was perfectly done with delicious black pudding and sausage but also succulent, cooked tomatoes still on the vine. The eggs benedict looked great but was a bit overshadowed by the full breakfast calling my attention on the other side of me, and by my beautiful waffles that called 'eat me!' The waffles were gorgeous and I could go on and on about the berry compote! It was delicious and I have to say I worked hard to restrain myself from licking the plate clean.\n\nBesides the fabulous food, the Blue Bear has a great ambiance to it. The couple who owns the place are really sweet and extremely dedicated to the Blue Bear. They work hard to make sure every customer enjoys their experience and the food. I also loved how they work with local artists to display beautiful artwork that is for sale, as well as featuring some invaluable artwork by fellow Yelpers! This brings home the overall theme of the Blue Bear that, for me, it represents not only a fantastic new business with great food but it is also a locals' place that is community-oriented."
0,"Sabor Amargo (Bittersweet) - Just left Sabor about 30 minutes ago and I'm still hungry and even more disappointed. Where do I start? Let's start with the good - friendly cashier, good tasting food. The bad? Everything else. The place was a complete disaster. It was dirty, the women's bathroom was broken and the men's restroom didn't have a working sink. Only the hot water knob was functional thus hot scolding water was the only option if you were brave enough to wash your hands (don't worry I did). I waited patiently for about 20 minutes and then grew rather impatient after 40. Finally when my order was delivered it was incomplete. I saw other customers having similar issues so I didn't panic. I asked for my order to be corrected and it wasn't. The cashier was a little too friendly and was too busy talking up customers to address my issue with urgency it required. I asked for a refund for the missing items from my order and unfortunately the cashier was unable to help me. She solicited the help of a cook who didn't speak really good English. She asked me how much I paid for my taco...I pointed to the menu and she attempted to swipe my card at least 4 times without success. Finally, I asked for my card back and just told her to forget it. All this time there is a manager type in the back room on his laptop being rather useless. I'm hopeful this person is a vendor and not an owner or manager. He never came to help quell the traffic or help out his overburdened staff. Overwhelming disappointed in that a few basic restaurant rules weren't followed - advise customers that the kitchen is backed up, offer a replacement for a missing item, how to manage a POS system, delivering \""fast food\"" in under 40 minutes. I hope this place gets it together, too many good restaurants in Charlotte who can fill this void."
1,"I love this place. It's great for a quick meal if you're shopping or if you work in the area and are on lunch break. \n\nI HIGHLY, HIGHLY recommend the Chopped Turkey salad. I get it a couple times a week and with very good reason:\n\nPerfectly portioned and well-priced, it's filled with chopped turkey, Vermont Cheddar, hard-boiled eggs, crispy lettuce, cherry tomatoes and corn. I prefer it with the Cowboy Ranch dressing, but there's also a vinaigrette option. All that for just under $6!\n\nI've gotten the sliders a couple times - they are delish and sized just right for what they are. I know if I am craving a big juicy burger, I can go hit up Johnny Rocket's in the mall, or better yet Five Guys when it opens!\n\nThis was a great concept and it's very nice that it's not trying to be something it's not. Take-out is obviously what the aim is here, as seating is limited."
1,"Probably the best mall in all of the surrounding Montreal regions. This place is huge and has a great selection of places to shop at. Furthermore, for many Quebecers, this is a place where we can shop AWAY FROM THE COLD WINTERS. You find a place to park your car and you can shop for hours confined in this huge shopping mall.\n\nThis place is also conveniently location by the 440 and 15 highways.\n\nWhile this place has many things going for it, I'll state a few in particular that doesn't work as well :\n\n- This place is a victim of its own popularity. If you hate huge crowds on weekends or anytime during the holidays, this place isn't for you unless you plan to come here early in the mornings. The foot traffic in this place is ridiculous. X-Mas time from mid-November till mid-January? Insanity.\n\n- Parking needs to be improved. This place is huge and they have added more and more restos and the place gets more and more popular... the parking however? This is the main reason whether or not I opt to go visit this place or not. Oh, it's 3 PM and I want to go somewhere.... let me check Yelp if I can find another location nearby... or come back tomorrow at 10-11 AM. No way, I'm wasting 10 minutes to find a park my car or park at the end of the lot and walk 5+ minutes in the winter cold.\n\n- Try to leave here at 5 PM on weekends, I dare you. Expect to wait 15-20 minutes to get out of the parking lot... if you're lucky. No thanks."
0,"I hate to even give this place one star.  I never write bad reviews but feel the need to warn everyone about this place.  It was great when the previous owner Amy had the place but under new ownership it has gone way downhill.  All of the good techs left and everyone working there is so unhappy, it's sad.  Went in for a gel mani/pedi Saturday and had to go back Monday to have them re-done.  My toenails look like a 5 year old painted them.  The worse part is that I had to sit for an additional 2 1/2 hours Monday when I already spent 2 1/2 hours there Saturday.  The owner didn't even apologize.  Nail salons are a dime a dozen here and with this kind of service this place wont last.  I wont be going back.\n\nTo top it off now I have an infection on my right middle finger where my manicurist cut me skin. AVOID!!"
0,"Ordered a Shiner Bock at the bar for $4 which I think is a quite adequate price and the business makes a decent profit. Ordered a second from the waitress.  Give her a five and she hands me back 50 cents. I asked her why my second beer was more than the first. She says when the band starts playing the price goes up.    Whaaaaat?\nI asked where that is posted and she said she didn't know.  I have never heard of that. I told the manager that I see that the owner has signs all over espousing his political views but not a single sign that says \""Take note:  when the band starts playing we arbitrarily raise drink prices\"".  I like to make informed decisions and I believe this is a scam when they don't make customers aware of this.   I have been there many times and spent a lot of $.\nI usually run a tab and may not have been aware of SF doing this in the past. However, when you pay cash it's obvious. The manager offered to refund my .50 but I told him to keep it. They apparently need it more than I do.  My advice:  order your drinks before the band gets going!  As for me, I will go elsewhere where they don't scam the locals..."
0,Very filthy floors trash overflowing restrooms filthy and the automatic light turns off to quickly. So go fast.  No seat covers in restroom. \nDOGNUT were ok but a not so favorable experience
0,"I come here pretty often, first time reviewing it.\n\nMy server was Alli . I'm a coconut addict so the flavor shots are awesome. I got a 99 cent coffee with liquid sugar and a double shot of coconut with cream. Cheap coffee bagels are great. I always get the everything bagels with veggie schmear. I want to give a full 5 star rating but the parking is hard sometimes. It's not really dunkin donuts' fault, its on the contractors that built it. Sometime I have to park by the sushi place and then walk over. Motorcycle parking is also very hard here, non existent in fact. \n\nAlso sometimes there's issues with the staff being able to hear your order because of the acoustics of the room. But don't get me wrong the staff here are darlings and are very happy to keep you happy. \n\nThe WiFi isn't great either, if you connect to it expect to not get anywhere online. Also the mocha \""coolatta\"" , to me tastes like a glop of sugar and coffee in a cup, no offense."
1,"I was recommended to make a reservation here for the outside terrace where there is a stunning view of the Bellagio light and water show. Great recommendation.\n\nFor three girls, we had two appetizers and split a less expensive bottle of red wine and it came to around $100 before tip. A good value for excellent food, service and a great show.\n\nAs young girls on a budget, we chose the cheapest red wine on the menu and the server - a lovely older gentlemen was nice enough to point out that it wasn't a typical wine and doesn't have much flavor so he gave us a sample. Definitely the blandest red wine I've ever had. We were so grateful that the server was looking out for his guests rather the check average. Or at least it seemed so. So we ordered his recommendation, a wine only a few dollars more.\n\nAs for the food - ordered the beef tartare and the fig and proscuitto flatbread. The beef tartare was very good, but the flatbread was out of this world amazing. So simple, but the ingredients went so well together.\n\nIf you had to go to one nice restaurant while in Vegas, this one is a good bet. Excellent food, great view and show of Las Vegas and wonderful service."
1,"Love: whiskey sours, drink prices, live music, ambiance, food - particularly, the coleslaw!!"
0,"First off,it is extremely difficult looking for this place as its in the back of the hospital and there is no sign at all saying that the pediatrics is located there... which is annoying. My daughter is a new patient with them and the first time I called to schedule a appointment the lady was rude and always interrupted when I spoke,there was a day where I couldn't make it in and I called to see if I could schedule a later appt,and the receptionist said abruptly that I couldn't because the doctor was leaving and there are no open spots today and I needed to take my daughter in right at that very moment... another day I came in the doctor we asked to be my daughters doctor and I even know what she looks like wasn't even our doctor,she didn't even tell us her name,she didn't even physically check on my daughter and I had to do all the work,not to mention this day I came in to check up on my daughter's burn marks... She didn't say much and didn't really do anything.. I'm very hesitant to even tske my daughter back here.. as of now I just called to schedule another appt,also not even to mention AGAIN the previous time we were there they didn't even let us know when to come back again,so as of now I called in to schedule another check up.... they open at 8? Yeah I'm pretty sure!  Ring Ring no answer,call again..ring ring no answer.. called 4 times and no answer. No they were not busy it rang for a long time, I'm not site if they're busy or ignoring calls. But I'm giving them one more chance and if it it blows bye bye arrowhead pediatrics."
1,"made my 2nd trip to try a #3, it was excellent!!!!! not overly spicy, but just enuff heat. made with mustard, kraut, hot peppers, red onion sauce.....yum!! can't wait to try something else!! extra fast service for a to-go dog. btw, #3 is the Babe"
1,"The service was excellent and my hostess was very nice and helpful. My wife and I ordered the Baby Back Ribs and the Broasted Chicken. Both are very delicious! I wasn't expecting the Broasted Chicken could be so awesome, it wasn't greasy at all, and you could still taste the flavor of the meat even it's fried.\n\nI also love the atmosphere of this place, with all the sport decorations on the wall, which is very different from any restaurants we've been to. I would recommend  this place to anyone who loves steak/BBQ!!"

1,"Simply awesome. We came here at the very end of our trip, and spent the rest of the night lamenting that we didn't come at the very beginning instead of following the coursemates to nearby Whistle Binkies (Americanized, loud, crowded, dull). The Banshee Labyrinth is a labyrinth indeed, with more rooms than I could count (granted, I'd been drinking for some time when I'd shown up there), a cinema, a room with a pool table and a room with a pole. \n\nIt's atmospheric as all getout - underground, the rooms hidden in cavernous vaults over several floors, cold stone walls, even a set of manacles hanging at the end of one candlelit hallway that looked pretty authentic. It's fun, but a bit creepy if you're not in a big group and the area you're in isn't crowded. I happen to like creepy, so I loved exploring the place and having a pint with the resident ghostie. Oh, yeah - it's also haunted as all getout, if you believe in that sort of thing (and I do). \n\nWe came on a Sunday night, so it was quiet, but busy enough that you can see it never really get dead (pun not intended) but I can imagine how crazy the Labyrinth would get on a weekend. This place has it all, though it's not for the faint of heart! *witchy cackle*"
1,"Definitely would go back to this place. \n\nWe saw  a deal on Slick deals for $30 per night and we jumped on it - I've never been to the Hard Rock and I didn't have high expectations for a room that was only $30 a night. Boy, was I wrong. \n\nWe got to stay in HRH and we were so confused when they told us we have a private entrance. But it was amazing- it's a private entrance to the parking lot and the guest elevators, the reception was fantastic and the room was the. best. thing. ever. I was expecting a matchstick room, but it had its own living room, two TVs, and in-room sound system. I wanted to stay swathed in their down comforter forever. \n\nThe casino and hotel itself is always in top party mode, but never too crowded where I feel stifled and paranoid but just enough where it's super fun. It's the perfect mixture of relaxation and fun. The HRH suites are never loud and actually gives you a great amount of privacy. \n\nRehab was a little problematic. This was my first time to these kinds of pools in Vegas -- I came too late in the afternoon to grab one of the very, very few recliners and I didn't even want to think about the cabanas. I didn't know where to leave my stuff while in the pool, either. The pool itself is great, great music and atmosphere and not too crowded if you're cool with just lounging in the pool. \n\nThe one tiny problem was-and it wasn't entirely their fault either-how they took the deposit. The rooms were only $30/ night but they withdrew the $250 regular price of the room from our accounts (per night) which put a huge dent on how much we can spend. I guess next time we just have to prepare the accounts better. \n\nDespite being off the strip, it's only a $9 cab ride to the main attractions. I would pay that to get away from the hectic Strip atmosphere -- overall, I would definitely come back again (hopefully with this deal). The people are super nice, Mr. Lucky is delicious, the rooms are great, the pool's amazing."
1,"I've been to Vegas several times and I can't believe that I only heard about this place a few months ago. \n\nEARL'S CLUB SANDWICH = A MUST! \n\nI enjoyed and split the Earl's Club sandwich the first night and made sure to get my own the second time I craved it. Thank God my friends and I stayed at Planet Hollywood! \n\nThe Earl's Club = roasted turkey, smoked bacon (mmm!), aged Swiss cheese, lettuce, tomatoes & this yummy Dijon sauce. On top of that, the bread is toasted to perfection."
0,I gave them a 2 the pizza was a 5 however the lady working the register had a attitude and was the most rude person I have ever encountered at a restaurant I had lunch there yesterday also and she was the same way so because of this I will not be back.
0,"The food is bad!!!! Drinks were good, so was the service, but I have never had a worse mushroom cheeseburger in my life. My boyfriend got a chicken sandwhich and couldn't finish it. How do u mess up basics like that?? Gross :("
0,"I don't like this place, but since it's the only place in the neighborhood to go for a bagel, I end up here too often.\n\nThe cinnamon-raisin bagel might have a total of 3 raisins in the entire bagel.  This has happened to me sooo many times, that I have stopped ordering it.  I feel like I'm just eating a cinnamon bagel. \n\nYou have to ask them to double toast your bagel.  If not, you will find that you have a luke-warm bagel with butter on it.  Ick.  I like my bagel browned just a little bit.\n\nBut I'm sure I will continue to come here until something better opens up nearby."
1,"Went to Luce for a business dinner / Christmas celebration.  I'm Italian and am very picky about the places I eat Italian food outside of my own house and can honestly say that this place is the real deal.\n\nWe made reservations because we had a larger party and I hate waiting.  Our table was waiting for us upon arrival and we were ushered to our seats in no time.  Manuel welcomed us warmly and proceeded to attend to us throughout the evening with ease.  Our service was impeccable.\n\nI ordered the Mare.  Lobster, shrimp, scallops, mussels, calamari over linguine with a light tomato sauce.  A lot of times when you get dishes like this the seafood is not fresh and there's not very much of it.  Totally the opposite at Luce.  Everything was prepared perfectly and there was plenty of seafood.  The tomato sauce was light, tangy and perfect.  Manuel slid me an extra napkin to use as a bib which is appreciated since I already put my dry cleaners first born through college.\n\nFor dessert I had the semifreddo which was light, almondy and had hazelnuts on top.  Fresh berries accompanied this perfect dessert.  To top it all off, their Caf\u00e9 Latte was made like I was in a sidewalk caf\u00e9 on the streets of Verona.\n\nLuce is one of the best for Italian in the Charlotte area.  I will be back and hope that you will too."
0,"This Long Wong's was a great dissapointment.  This location opened up not to long ago and my husband and I decided to try it out. Not to mention we are big fans of their wings. First time we went to this long Wongs, it was about 30 minutes before closing the kitchen and they told us they ran out of wings. We went back a different day and ordered wings, the sauce on the wings was terrible as if they sprinkled chilly powder you would put on fruit. The second order of mild wings didn't have sauce at all. It was a disaster. From this point on I am only sticking to the long Wongs on 32nd Street and Thomas, they sure make the best wings."
1,"Loved the variety of yogurt flavors and toppings. I had to laugh when my husband filled his cup to the brim and then asked, \""How do they price this stuff?\"" By the ounce, so plan accordingly. It was worth every ounce!"
1,"This is a great place to go in the morning or late at night after partying.  I will forever enjoy going to this place because it reminds me of truck stop food while traveling.  The hungry traveller will always fill you up with bottomless pancakes but the country fried steak is also something I always get.  It gets 4 stars because sometimes they are understaffed and takes a bit to get service.  But when I go, I'm usually not in a hurry anyways.  The staff is always friendly day or night. Even a simple side salad is fresh and deserving of props.  The awesome thing is the fresh desserts and pie will satisfy any drunk or Sunday camper.  If you're tired of the usual IHOP or hole in the wall breakfast place, enjoy the old school diner atmosphere that th\nis place has to offer."
1,"Tableau is a very open and inviting restaurant. The one thing we enjoyed about Tableau is their outside seating and the weather was perfect for having brunch outside. The seating arrangements are done well, you're not close to your neighbors and can enjoy your meal freely. \n\nService was efficient and fast. We never had to ask for our drinks to be refilled and they made sure our coffee was filled which was real nice.\n\nThe first order was museli. It was made with cinnamon and small strips of apples. You are served with milk, brown sugar, etc. The museli was soft and tasty. The aroma of the cinnamon was enticing. We enjoyed the museli quite a bit.\n\nWe ordered the lemon ricotta pancake.....need I say more? It was gooood! If it was a short or full stack, we would have eaten it in a hot second. The hint of lemon was perfect and the ricotta added a very nice texture to the pancake. It was served warm and moist. We didn't even use the butter or the maple syrup.  \n\nNext order was their benie! They make their benies 3 ways and we chose the most basic one. It had cured ham, poached egg, and a nice sauce to which we requested be put on the side. I still enjoy Mon Ami Gabi's benie more but Tableau was good.\n\nOverall, Tableau was a good surprise. We will be back for more in the near future!"
1,This is a nice BK.  The building has been remodeled and looks great.  The inside is pretty and looks very modern.  They have the usual seating as well as a little cove with couches and cushy seats to sit and have a coffee.  The playground area is nice and big.  It is 2 stories with a lot of room for the kiddos to run around in.  There is pretty limited seating for adults though with only 3 tables available.  Another bonus was the new automated soda machine.  I love these machines and the abundance of soda choices.  Yummy!  Overall it was a nice BK as compared to the others I have visited.
1,"Dinner started off rocky-- we were 20 minutes late for the reservation, but they still gave us a table when we arrived :) Service was a little slow at first but was top notch once Marco decided to take care of us.\nWe started with the avocado fries and also complementary salmon croquettes and champaign while we waited for our cocktails/ wine. \nI got the lamb (it doesn't come with any garnish) and my friends got the fillet mingon (also no garnish), scallops w/risotto and the salmon with roasted veggies. The food was excellent and cooked to perfection, but I was a little disappointed that my lamb was alone on the plate. \nWe came here for a birthday dinner and left with a once-in-a-lifetime experience, which led to an unforgettable Friday night! Marco is the best! I am not getting paid/ perks for this review."
0,"Locker Room sucks ass\nThe locker room is WAY too small ... they have a whopping two benches that comfortably sit 4 each, so a whole 8 people fit in the entire room at any given time. The rest of the locker room is wasted by \""premium\"" lockers that virtually NO ONE uses. Then there's the very awkward positioning of chairs where people can hang out and lounge in the locker room while you are changing in front of them. And although there's signs that say \""no cell phone use\"" in the locker room, the people in those chairs usually have their phones out with backside cameras facing YOU.\n\nUndependable shower water temperatures.\nThis places has gone weeks without hot water in the showers, and it's always hit and miss. It's been over 3 months and they can't seem to get it right.\n\nMachines in various states of disrepair.\nThis place is brand new and still there are numerous machines in  various states of \""broken-ness\"". It's just amazing to me that these machines are left broken for months on end. Do they ever use their own equipment?\n\n\""Opps for got to tell you\""\nSo while getting the sales tour we were shown the tanning bed, of which the salesman just forgot to tell us that it was an extra charge. After telling management about this scam, the response was \""sorry\"".\n\nOne decent thing is that they supply razors, q-tips, antiperspirant, bodywash, cream rinse and shampoo in the locker room/showers.\n\nI wish I had gone back to the YMCA rather than get locked into a 2 year deal with this poorly managed gym. The Y does not have any long term contracts and they have a pool, racquetball courts, basketball courts (of which Gold's has none) along with two workout rooms and all cheaper and without a long contract ..."
0,"i'd heard about out of the blue drill hall a few times in terms of a monthly flea market and other local leith events.  however, when i went this past friday for a bavarian beer festival i was seriously not impressed.\n\nthe venue itself is huge!  it's an excellent space and it's clear they've put a lot of work to refurbish it to a nice standard.  the big open hall is probably quite good for a impromptu performance space or a small market with stalls.  however, i did find the hall to be incredibly cold although there were heat lamps dotted about to try to warm things up.\n\nthe bavarian beer festival was just, meh.  i'm not sure if this was organised by the people that run out of the blue but i'm making the assumption that it was as i didn't see any other organiser listed.  there were long tables set up in the middle of the hall giving it a very church supper kind of feel.  there was only one location serving food leading to a massive queue since only one person was taking orders.  additionally while the food was relatively cheap it was of poor quality and i couldn't even eat most of it.  there were two bavarian beers on offer and they ran out of one of them an hour into the event.  the entertainment eventually started and i have to say i was not very entertained but perhaps this was because i was freezing cold and hungry with only beer to try to make things better.\n\nso a very unorganised event that left me not wanting to return to this location for any other event.  so yes very much meh i've experienced better."
1,"Five stars you say ? Isn't that overdoing it? No. Nope. Nada. \nEverything down to the flavors, service and ambiance oozes class at this place. From the moment we were seated to getting our meals packed, we were given the royal treatment. \nNow the menu. We started with tempura fried calamari which came with Sriracha foam (wow what an invention!). We completely devoured the two plates of this appetizer! \nI ordered the short rib, one friend ordered the steak and two others the burger. I didn't get a taste of the burgers but oh man do I regret not getting the steak, honestly the best steak I have had... I'm not exaggerating. The flavors, the tenderness everything was on point. Now mind you the short rib wasn't bad at all, the meat was tender and tore of the bone with a sweet cranberry sauce. \nNow the service was.... let's just say this. Our glass of waters never emptied past the halfway point, EVERYTIME it got close to...the magical waitstaff immediately re-filled it. Now that's attention to service. Our server was sweet and even provided a free birthday dessert to my friend when we noted that we were celebrating. \nDefinitely a place to check out. You are paying for quality here."
0,"Seriously? 4 star average out of 1515 Yelpers? I guess most of the peeps giving the BurGR 4 stars are used to eating leftovers or frozen microwave foods. I don't mind standing in line for 30 mins on a Tuesday night at 8:30 pm. I don't mind waiting 45 minutes for the burger everyone loves the Farm burger.. Just prove me it's worth the wait. \n\nIt doesn't even taste on the level of Cheesecake Factory's burger which is $4 cheaper! After being able to seat then waited 45 minutes! Really? For a burger that they just added sunny side up egg and duck bacon? Their lucky they don't hire chubby waitresses. The servers gave great customer service so far. But for an ordinary burger like the Farm burger and Hells kitchen burger. Don't waste your time. They weren't even warm when it got to us.\n\nMy nephew who ordered the Hells Kitchen burger which is supposed to be hot or spicy that I recommended according to \""Yelp reviews,\"" told me it's not even hot and it tasted ordinary LOL! One common word to describe..Overrated."
1,Came here with a lot of ppl (30+) and enough seats for everyone!! Food was fast and good. Chicken was moist and the Greek fries weren't bad. Overall pretty happy and stuffed right now.
0,"WARNING WARNING DO NOT USE THIS MOVING COMPANY.\n\nThey are rude, unprofessional and lost 2 of my boxes.\n\nLike the other review, at first all seemed well and it was a competitive quote. On the day of the move the movers were 3 hours late and no one thought to inform me. Delivery: I had been clear that I needed all my stuff by a certain date. I asked when the best pick up date was in order to receive my furniture in time. I was guaranteed my stuff would get there in time. I have kids and needed to make sure I had beds for them to sleep in and all my baby gear. \n\nDuring the transfer of my furniture I checked in at least 4 times to make sure everything was still set for an on time delivery. The company was hard to reach and no one returned my calls when they said they would. Then I got an email saying to contact their US company (btw not their company, but a company they hire), these people were great but unfortunately because of the schedule made by Target moving, my furniture did not arrive on time and I was forced to purchase baby gear, kitchen ware, air mattresses etc.\n\nI seeked a credit from Target moving over the phone and by several emails and I am now being ignored.\n\nBottom line DO NOT USE THEM. I generally do not write bad reviews as I am quite easy going and forgiving but in this instance I thought it would be best to warn anyone who was thinking of using them.\n\nIf I was still in Canada I would bring them to small claims.\n\nSo disappointing."
1,"I know I promised Mojo just recently that I wouldn't cheat on them but I have to admit that I visited my local Yogurtland this weekend. \n\nWe showed up around 8pm and the place was packed. There were college kids, families and softball teams, oh my! People love this place. I had to be pushy and interrupt the one visible employee there (who was busy ringing up everyone at the register) for sample cups. I tried a few and chose the red velvet flavor. The toppings seemed really fresh and were much larger pieces than what Mojo offered. \n\nOverall my experience was pretty good. There were many yogurt flavors and topping choices. The store didn't seem as well kept as Mojo. The machines were covered in drippy yogurt and the toppings all over the counter. It would have also been nice if there was an employee on the sales floor to help new customers with the process. I think I may go again but hope the cleanliness and customer service is improved on."
0,"Went by Lett'y's and it did not appear busy with at least half the tables empty, but still took almost an hour before our food came out and my wife only got a burger while I got a gravy biscuit with chicken.  I suspect a slow kitchen not the wait staff, but offering some bread while we waited (and WAITED) would have made it more tolerable than just coming by every 10 minutes saying the food will be out any minute.  We waited ~40 minutes from the time we ordered and then the food was not that good either.  I tried the rotisserie chicken salad on a previous visit that was very good , but this time the food was a big disappointment.   \n\nWe had high hopes for Letty's, but after today I do not see us going back anytime soon with rock solid restaurants in the area like Landmark & Portofino's.  \n\nI hope Letty's will fix their issues and we will consider giving them another chance once the memory of the very bad experience today fades."
0,"What a shame. As my high school counselor once told me, \""so much potential, but....\""  ;)\n\nThe Frank Lloyd Wright design is just beautiful. But in the same way you just don't need to sleep in a Ferrari, you don't need to stay here either. Come visit for lunch or dinner and check out the beautiful property, because the Frank & Albert's restaurant is great, and now that i mention it, the BREAKFAST there was fantastic. The kindest, smartest, nicest wait staff in the morning, and the food is just so creative and different, yet so tasty. But i digress.\n\nThe problem is that it's an old building. And with old buildings, come problems, even though it's been remodeled. The walls are thin, so you can hear your neighbors getting into arguments or getting it on with perfect clarity, neither one of which you really want to hear while on vacation. And you can hear the drunk people walking and yelling down the halls at 2am, 3am, and even 4am. I'm not making any of this up as I lived through it, all in 1 night. And the a/c units are loud, because again, it's an old building and that's just the way it is.\n\nThe rooms are a good size, around 500 square feet, and well designed and furnished. Which makes it even more of a shame that you can't really enjoy it.\n\nAnd if you're thinking about staying at the Ocatilla building, that's where I stayed. So you can't escape the riff raff by staying there either.\n\nAs another guest correctly points out, the Ocatilla side is not worth the extra dollars. That definitely over promises and under delivers. The pool is not exclusive to Ocatilla guests, as no one monitors the area, so you have people who pool hop who shouldn't be there. You can't find a server to save your life to get a drink at the pool either, so you have to walk out to get your own. \n\nThe Ocatilla concierge folks are extremely nice as can be, but their niceness doesn't walk the hallways and pick up trash or room service trays that sit out in the hallways all day long without being picked up. The \""free\"" breakfast is simply bagels, muffins, fruit, juice and coffee. Puts the con in continental breakfast, if you ask me.\n\nAnd one of the strangest parts is that if you drive yourself there (I rented a car from the airport), the parking is like Star Wars and is far far away. Even valet doesn't help because the Ocatilla building is in the back of the property with no parking near it, which doesn't seem like a big deal except when it's 108 degrees outside. AND they charge $12 extra for even self parking. That's bad, especially when the parking is so inconvenient.\n\nAnd the $28 resort fee on top of paying extra for the Ocatilla rooms? While having \""free\"" wifi by the pool was nice, i don't know what the other $18 difference is for since you still have to tip people and tip the maid. I've stayed at other resorts with \""resort fees\"" that include tips for everyone, so i get it and like it since i don't have to carry cash for deliveries and doormen and concierge, but i think the Biltmore doesn't quite realize that resort fees weren't designed to get more money from guests: it was originally intended to make our lives easier so that we don't have to worry about tipping and carrying money!\n\nSo i'll stop being a downer. The staff was extremely friendly, the rooms were well designed and super clean, and the property is beautiful. I stayed for 6 nights and ate at Frank & Alberts 5 times (1x dinner, 2x breakfast, 2x lunch). 4 out of 5 of the meals were fantastic, so that's a pretty great batting average for any restaurant. As mentioned in the beginning, go there to eat, hang out, get a drink, and enjoy the beautiful property. Heck, even stay there in a non-Ocatilla room for a few nights, but make sure your room is far far away from the elevator."
1,"This is another Fox Restaurant Concept and they've once again created a unique and innovated culinary experience based on a timeless classic. I love Mexican food and Blanco has taken it to another level. They have a large menu with enough selection and diversity to satisfy anyone. My favorite item on the menu are the Ahi Tuna tacos, they are simply spectacular. Nothing better than a few tacos and a corona after a long day of work. My only issue with this restaurant is the service. For some reason the staff is less attentive here than at other Fox Restaurants. I've been here 5 of 6 times and the service is always so-so. The food more than makes up for it though."
0,"We`ve been here a few times over the years.  The food is average.  Service is slow and they don`t really go out of their way for you.  My friend can`t eat gluten, but they said they were unable to modify any of the dishes to accommodate him (even something as simple as leaving out some cheese was too much to ask).  Probably won`t bother coming here again.  There are plenty of great restaurants in Montreal, but this isn`t one of them."
1,"What a great place.  Amazing food (Skirt Steak and Sea Bass!), beautiful service ( Thanks Crystal!) and all in a beautiful place.  PS- Don't let the menu scare you off as spicy as it reads.  There is something here for everyone.  Very great restaurant!"
0,"I came in the other day and as I was walking In I noticed all 3 hosts sitting there gossiping and I came up and told one of them politely I was there for take out. The host replied with total attitude and said \""uhh it's at the bar!\"" Needless to say I was thrown back. Please tell me how I am supposed to know where take out is. Well when I got to take out the girl was awesome but as I was leaving the hostess were all 3 sitting there gossiping once again and as I was walking out never got a good bye or thank you have a great day. I've been hosting for over a few years now and this is definitely a problem. I figure Olive Garden hires for looks only."
1,Love this place! Right around the corner from my house and open late! The Quality is great and the service is always fantastic.  It's little more expensive than other ramen places but worth it
1,"We were staying at a local hotel and used online ordering to feed our crew.  The ordering went smoothly and the pleasant surprise was the food arrived early and warm.  We ordered two of their usual pizzas and one of our custom orders.  Could have had a few more toppings on one of them, but overall nice value and timely service with warm food.  We looked for the specials on-line and save a few dollars.  Worth the time to do so.  Would order again."
0,"i think it might be a california thing, but i like my slushes a bit icey.... they are more like a slurpee here, overblended and watery... they didnt even fix it after we asked for a replacement. fail"
1,"Solid buffet. Hated the line, but that just means it's worth waiting for. All the food seemed standard for a buffet but it was just a little bit better than \""standard.\"" The set up is really spacious and open. Not once did I feel crowded, even during prime dinner time. \n\nTake advantage of the all you can drink beer and wine area. Or if you're like me, all you can drink root beer :P. What stands out the most to me is the dessert area. There's a variety of choices in textures besides the annoying cream type of desserts that are in shot glasses. Gelato is bomb. The barista section is cool. Did I say that the gelato is bomb?"
1,"From the moment you walk in the door, you begin to understand Pavlov's theory.  The aroma from the wood fired grill is fantastic, and a precursor of what is to come.\n\nLarge open restaurant with a relaxed feel to it.  Fantastic selection of WI beers.  Devote following of locals, and plenty of tourists fill the restaurant.  \n\nI decided I wanted to skip the infamous cheese curds, and go with a selection of WI's finest cheeses.  Cheeses were delicious.  Part way though my board I noticed some landjaegers.  Dried hanging meat at a bar.....must have.  Not sure exactly what they were, and falling somewhere in between not caring and not wanting to know what they are made of, they were delicious and are a welcome pairing with the cheese board.\n\nWith the name Old Fashioned, I had to have one.  How could you not?  I didn't realize the variety of Old Fashioned's that they had.  I started traditional, but after seeing a sign on the wall I had to try a Korbel Old Fashioned.  How could more than 575,000 people be wrong.  They weren't - \n\nBartender was a bit of a dud, seeming to have more of a desire for the night to end, than to serve,  Hoping it was just an off night.  \n\nI would gladly return for one of their specialties, especially their fish fry."
0,"UPDATE. \nThis restaurant has literally gone from the best indian restaurant in vegas to just another indian restaurant in las vegas, The main reason might be the change in chef a couple weeks ago, I've been to delhi india cuisine a few times now but now the taste has changed significantly from the food tasted there a month ago, the service has never really been commendable anyway, Do not believe the reviews, most of the 5 stars come from family profiles, SMH. Looks like im going to have to go back to mint or mount everest."
1,"Love, love, love the bean and cheese burritos and guacamole! Delicious lemonade and horchata too!!"
1,This place is AMAZING Mom & Pops place!  \nDishes: \nChicken Cordon Blue Al Gorganzola-my husband loved it. I thought it was a little overcooked. \n& Lobster Ravioli-Superb! Very tastey \nThey also gave us an extra shot-Lemon Drops to drink for free :)  \nIt's not very large inside. Nice touch with Ferrari outside!
0,"Gennaros is sort of a hit or miss. Sometimes they are very well made pizzas but other times it is pretty generic and bland. Lately it has been the latter. Also STAY AWAY from their sandwiches. I had a chicken parm sandwich and it was awful,  I couldn't actually finish it."
0,"Horrible and overpriced. I got the chicken salad on a French roll. The chicken salad had way too much dijon mustard and mayo. There was more mayo than chicken. It cost me $9 just for the sandwich which means no drink, no chips. I feel so ripped off. So far Bally hotel has the worse lunch spots. If I wasn't attending a course here, I would never eat at any of the restaurants here. Tomorrow I am def going outside in search for a spot."
0,"I know I shouldn't look a gift horse in the mouth, but that's exactly how I feel. I have been to Grimaldi's twice: at my last two birthdays to use their free pizza coupon. Although I appreciate the \""freeness\"" of the pie, I'm going to have to pass in the future. Why? The pizza here is just not very good.\n\nI should have known when the waitress offered garlic and oregano with the pie. If I wanted to season it myself, I would have made it at home. Seriously, this sauce is just pureed tomatoes. I think they try to make up for it with Buffalo mozzarella, but the bulk of any pizza is the crust and sauce. Although the former is tasty, the latter is a waste of tomatoes. \n\nThankfully, I didn't pay for it, because a large pizza goes for nearly $20 here. My suggestion is to head to a local Barro's and get something much less expensive and better. The benefit here is that the service was pretty good, but if you're looking for pizza, walk on by."
1,"What an underrated place!  If I could give it 4.5 stars I would, because it's just that much better than so many high priced cow places I've been to.  I'd give five stars if they were to kick up the side dishes just a notch.  Field greens and arugula in the salad instead of bagged iceberg, perhaps?  Twice baked potatoes?  Garlic smashies?   I know these niceties might add to the cost slightly but I'm willing to pay it.\n\nSince we were staying at Southpoint, we were motivated to have dinner here.  So easy, just downstairs, and they were having a deal that was ridiculously cheap.  I don't remember the exact price but it was CHEAP!  Like, $16 for a whole dinner with all the trimmings.\n\nWe ordered the single-cut prime rib (I think it was called Southpoint cut), baked potatoes, and the house salad.  Nothing fancy, no frills.  Each item came out on a separate plate.  You people who hate for your food to touch... this place is for you!\n\nOur prime rib was done to a turn.  Perfection.  It was perched in the middle of its own plate, atop a pool of clarified pan juices.  The waiter offered us horseradish, which we accepted.  The meat and horseradish tasted amazing.  I could tell the meat was aged and it was seasoned beautifully.\n\nThe house salad was fine; nothing special.  The waiter tossed it at our table and that was a nice touch, albeit sort of unnecessary from our point of view.\n\nThe bread was fresh and warm.  The butter had been pressed into a rose-shaped mold.\n\nWe ordered two bottles of wine:  one white Sauvignon Blanc, one red Petit Syrah.  Sorry I don't remember the variety of wineries.  But they were good.\n\nThe service was prompt and personable.  No complaints.  The atmosphere was nice too.  The restaurant is on a level above the casino floor.  So you won't hear all the racket or breathe all the smoke.  The lighting is soft, the booths are roomy, appointments and fixtures quality but not extravagant.  \n\nI remember walking out of the restaurant, telling Gary I really enjoyed my dinner.  Looking back, yeah, I enjoyed it, especially in view of the meal we'd had the night before at Triple George.  By far, this restaurant had better food, service, wine, and atmosphere.\n\nThe best part of all this, is we left the restaurant, having had plenty of good food and wine, for well under $100, including tip!\n\nPilot information:  Southpoint is easy to access from Henderson Executive Airport and McCarren Int'l airport.  The hotel has a shuttle that will take you to/from either.  At least it did when we were there.  You should call and verify first, just to make sure."
0,"Ordered delivery, lemon chicken sauce was too watery, pork egg roll was too salty and chicken fried rice was too bland. My husband got the fried dumplings and they tasted kind of funny. This morning I am definitely regretting eating it. If you don't want to spend the next morning in the bathroom, STAY AWAY!"
0,"1st appearance,  hotel looked okay. Upon further review, most of the electrical outlets were covered and the surge protector appeared fried..yet they left it in the room. Customer service seriously lacking (all departments). Don't waste your $$$ at this dump."
0,"Imax is OK,but the ushers are uptight and paranoid.\n\nWent to catch a matinee mid week and the movie I wanted to see was about 30 minutes from start.\n\nWalked into another theater to kill some time and sat there for a few minutes.\nIn the meantime the ushers walked in and out about 5 or 6 times looking for what ,I have no idea.\nThere are about 15 people in the theater.\n\nShowtime for the other movie is just about to start and I walk into the other theater and Joe Usher (about fifty something)asks me for my ticket stub.\nHe then proceeds to check the movie marquee to see if it matches.\n\nLook it's 9 bucks for a matinee that has 10 people in it,so why are you hassling me like I'm a 12 year old sneaking into an R rated movie.\n\nIt's not like it's a first run sold out movie!\n\nDude,isn't Wal Mart hiring?\n\nNo longer a movie theater or casino I will visit."
0,"2.0 Stars\n\nCanonita Express is located in the mall-like eatery in the Venetian Grand Canal Shoppes. Apparently it's the little sister restaurant of Taqueria Canonita, also located in the vicinity. Despite Taqueria Canonita having better reviews, I don't see Canonita Express living up to the standards of its elder sibling.\n\nLike with most mall-like eateries, the food won't exactly be stellar, but it's quick, convenient, and relatively cheap. I decided to try the steak taco platter for $7.50 and it came with 2 crispy tacos, rice, and beans . The chicken version went for $0.50 cheaper.\n\nThe tacos had a nice crisp and the Pico de Gallo on the side was fresh. The steak itself didn't have much flavor, but the hot sauce packets did help. The beans and rice were mediocre at best.\n\nMy food came out relatively fast and our server was friendly enough to provide refills on my water. Aside from these factors, I feel there are better options in the food court to try like \""Awesome Panda\""."
1,"Getting an appointment was a little rough, but they called as soon as someone cancelled to fit me in last minute (thankfully!).  I found it a little strange that they called me at 8pm on a Friday night, and again at 830am the next morning (odd business etiquette?) I arrived with me mum and guns in tow and they girls seemed super excited to work with me.  I'm not to sure who was who, I don't recall an introduction, but these women have a really great business going on.  They're totally professional, guided me through tons of different poses, and made me feel beautiful.  I CANNOT wait to see my final products and put in an order for a sexy little book!!

0,"we came here for my birthday dinner last year \n\nit was pretty dark inside but its italian so its usually like that\n\nthe greeter asked how many and then just turned around expecting us to know she wanted us to follow her. Rude.\n\nthe server came up, rushing us to sit down, didnt introduce himself and asked what we wanted to drink turned around without a word and walked away. when he came back he sat our drinks down sloshing one of them on to the table and then walked away.\n\nwe got up and left\nno thanks, carrabbas, you suck balls."
1,"I don't know why, but I used to love this place so much that I'd make my boyfriend get this and hand deliver it to me at work. Is that ridiculous?\n\nIt has been a while since I've gone back, but from what I DO remember, the Jasmine Milk Tea was my favorite drink here. Hot or cold, you couldn't go wrong."
0,"Charcoal Room, we are breaking up.  It's not me it's you, you have changed and not for the better.  Last week my husband and I went to T-Bones Chophouse at Red Rock, and it made me miss The Charcoal Room.  So this week we made our reservations, and I had one thing on my mind, boneless baby back ribs.  My most favorite thing here has changed.  I thought they were made of pork but these were beef and seemed like instead of baby backs, they were more like spare ribs.  They changed the meat and the quality on me and kept the price.  Sad day. \n\nWe had reservations at five, but they didn't open on time.  Service wasn't as good as it was before and I felt like we got a little attitude because we didn't order alcohol.  The last slap was a cheap \""Thank You\"" take out bag and generic Styrofoam to go containers instead of the classic red string reusable bag they had before.  I know it seems silly, but if you are spending sixty dollars plus a head for dinner, dressing up and bother to make a reservation, you want a good experience right down the the last detail.  The search for a new favorite is on."
1,Pizza is Always Hot and ready never need to wait! Taste good for the price of $5 pies
0,"This is neither a venue or dance club, more like 2 small warehouses trying to look like both. I attended 2 concerts there and am over this place. I watched the doorman play favorites with some people and get heavy handed with others...ego trip. Phoenix has many much nicer venues with a more professional management I'll spend my money with those."
1,"Right off the top, I'd like to say that this was the best buffet that I've ever had.\n\nNow that we've got that out of the way, let's get to the details.\n\nI love the idea of small individual plates for the dishes, as it enables better portion control, especially if you just want to try the dish and wind up not finishing it because you weren't particularly feelin' it all that much.  The variety of dishes was a dizzying array, as I found myself not even knowing where to start!  I started off with some gnocchi with a lamb ragu and olive oil poached fish, but as I walked further down, my eyes lit up at the sight of a stack of bones all exposing its delicious marrow for all to see and feast on.  Making my way closer to the marrow, I was pleasantly surprised again to see a chef giving individual cuts of roasted leg of lamb!  At this point I was as excited as Homer in a donut factory, with the donuts being plates of fine cuisine in my case!\n\nNow imagine that excitement doubled as I began tasting my choices:  the fish was flaky and light, the gnocchi was flavorful, the marrow was sinfully delicious and the leg of lamb was juicy and seasoned to perfection.  The dishes I chose for my second round weren't as memorable, not for lack of taste and quality, but for my sudden onset of gluttony taking over and turning my memory into a fuzzy haze of delicious food.  But thankfully, their sublime desserts lives on in my memory.  They literally had too much to name off, but trust that their generous variety doesn't sacrifice quality at all.  \n\nAnd so, now you know why I say that this is the best buffet I've ever had."
1,"Love the food!  I always order the pomegranate chicken salad, with a side of bread and make my own pomegranate chicken sandwhich.  More often than none the service is great, however everyone once in a while you get the \""Im too cool to work here and serve you\"" attitude.  Minor annoyance, worth living through for the food."
0,"Tonight was one of the insulting, pathetic displays of customer service we have had.  \nMy wifeis Gluten Free, and after clearly stating this to the server, and ordering a supposedly \""gluten free\"" item (grilled mahi mahi on corn tortillas), they served the tacos on flour tortillas, and continued to insist they were corn tortillas.  The manager finally got involved and admitted they were flour tortillas, and the menu has a mistake.  For a Celiac, this is a pretty big mistake and can cause severe problems.  At this point, there was really nothing left to order except sashimi.  She also added on a salad, at which point the server asked if cucumbers are okay for gluten free!\nClearly this restaurant needs to better train the staff on what this means.  The manager was also very unaccommodating and unapologetic.\nUnfortunately this is a place with decent sushi that we will never be in again due to their complete incompetence regarding accommodating special dietary requirements."
1,"i'm no 'cue expert, but I like food, so I'll toss in my two cents. I had the rib tips (a special) last night. They were dry and a little overcooked, yet still miraculously tender. They were sauced to perfection - not glopping off with every bite, but yet a good counterpoint to the dryness of the meat itself. I ate every last bite with enthusiasm. The sauce was sweet and tangy and dark and everything I want from barbecue sauce - again, perfect with the meat. \n\nThe special came with a side of rosemary tater tots, which were fantastic. I accidentally dropped one into the paper container holding the remainder of the ribs, and let's just say it was a happy accident - the sauce and the tots got along just fine. Dipping a rosemary-flavored tater tot into delicious BBQ sauce - it's just like I invented Silly Putty up in here! \n\nAnyway I was filled and very pleased with my meal for $6.50 - I can't wait to try the pulled pork, but from what I could see the different specials looked pretty amazing... So who knows what I'll order (and from that, concoct!) upon my next visit.\n\n@ritewaycatering on the twitters, by the way"
0,"This place was absolutely disgusting. I read the reviews thinking it might be worth checking out.  The chicken in my chimichanga was very fatty and had very little flavor. My wife's enchiladas were also disgusting they had some weird cheese that looked and tasted like shredded string cheese. The salsa wasn't too bad but the chips were hard and cold. \n\nThere was only one waitress for the entire restaurant which was very disappointing because we had to wait for a good amount of time to order our food and to get our check.\n\nOverall, I will never ever go back or recommended it to anyone. We only ate several bites of our food and had to go somewhere else because the food was too disgusting to eat."
1,i was looking for a place that sold real Mexican tacos. so i ask a friend and told me this was the best place in town. and i agree. the burritos where not that big but still good. now the tacos where amazing. best in flour tortia.
0,"There are some good prices on things.  But selection of flavors is not great.  If you like low sodium or low fat versions of foods, you will find Winco does not meet your needs.  I was very disappointed in them today when I tried to buy produce there.  I went to the avocados and found a whole boxful already rotten.  Not ripe, not very ripe. Rotten.  Squishy with flies.  Same with the tomatoes.  Do they think that's good enough for their customers?\n\nMoving on to dairy and other perishables, I found you have to watch the expiration dates, some were within 2 days of it.  Stock up on prepackaged items when they can be had for a good price, but I can't see doing my regular grocery shopping here."
1,"My kids love it! We love it! Its a WIN!\n\nMy kids love the food, the firehats and the cool digital coke machine. I LOVE the Engineer sub...which is easy to remember since my hubby's an Engineer at Intel!\n\nI took my father here when he was visiting and he really liked the food too. This is saying something, because he is very picky about his food."
0,"I was in search of a particular rc plane that can only be found at Target within the store. It is not available online. I searched locations to find the remote control plane and drove to this location. Although, the online directory assured it was in stock at this store, I found it was not. I went to guest services to supply the DPC# and the clerk said there was definitely two in stock. When he called the clerk in electronics she confirmed it but would not bring the item to me. I was asked to walk back to the department that I had already searched to pick up the item. When I got there it was the same selection I had already viewed and was not the Jet Set 2 that I was looking for. The clerk informed me that it matched the DPC# that I brought in. I am very frustrated as this is the second store that I have gone to and was only referred to go to another store in Tempe! Too much running around and no definite answers! Feels like false advertisement to post an item only to find they do not carry it! My son will be very disappointed!"
0,"This place sucks. It reflects the ghetto area surrounding it. The cashiers are loud and annoying and don't have a trace of customer service etiquette  And I'm pretty sure some of them actually bring their kids to work with them...expecting customers to babysit them. \n\nThere is almost always some weird, drunken derelict sitting near the restrooms. And the teenagers that hang around are always talking trash about other people they know."
1,All around good place to stop for a bite.\nReasonable prices and quality food.
0,I give two stars because I usually use this location to get water before a hike. Yesterday I come in to get water and the cashier is talking with her manager about something and making me wait for like 5 minutes. Cashier acknowledged me no hi how are you and no smile. Staff needs to be trained and store needs a cleaning. Will I come back.....maybe
1,"10/19/10 and 01/02/11\n\nTook Mom w/ me for her first visit to St. Francis (and my second!) for a late lunch around 1p.  The place was packed, and as usual, very noisy.  Thought perhaps I'd finally get a chance to see how the seating was upstairs, but we were seated on the main floor.  Even though we were seated right away, it took more than 10 minutes before our server finally greeted us.\n\nEven though I knew what I'd order for us both, I let Mom look over the limited menu-- for once, the lengthy downtime worked to our advantage!  She almost went for the lunch combo (soup, salad, and half of the Del Real sandwich), but in the end, we ordered the two items I already had my eye on before we'd left home (love to read menus online!).  We decided to share the French onion burger and the Red wine braised beef, and both came w/ a choice of fries or red quinoa salad, so we chose one of each.  The burger was a beauty!  On a substantial and gruyere-smothered patty lay greens, smoked bacon, and crispy shoestring onions, and these were all topped w/ a gorgeous bun!  We wouldn't hesitate to order this one again!  While the fries looked very promising, they were soggy, but Mom happily ate them.  I had the Red wine braised beef sandwich and the red quinoa salad to contend w/, so I didn't bother sending the fries back.  :)\n\nWe both loved the quinoa salad-- what a pleasant surprise!  Red quinoa is very good for you-- high in fiber AND protein.  A superfood, indeed!  The key to this salad was the citrus vinaigrette.  A must-try!  The braised beef was also very, very good!  That is, when we finally tried it w/ the horseradish sauce, which somehow was overlooked while Mom and I were divvying up the entrees.  Panini-style, between two slices of their Texas toast, buttered, and gruyere cheese.  DO NOT forget the horseradish sauce, as it just makes the flavors pop in your mouth.  \n---\nWhen I'd learned that Dennis Rowland was in the house during Sunday brunch, I couldn't wait to go to SF on a rare Sunday off work!  Again, it was a packed house, and I finally was seated upstairs.  Oh my Lord, what a horrendous place to be!  While I could hear Rowland and his band play (it's actually less noisy up there- go figure), I couldn't see them, what w/ the rafters and the ceiling fans underneath, and the cork flooring made every footstep coming and going annoyances I couldn't wait to get rid off by finally leaving!  Thank goodness the two entrees I'd ordered made up for these... hiccups.\n\nLiked the Iron skillet pancake (w/ dark chocolate chips and fresh raspberries), but thought the kitchen was a little light-handed on the chips-- please add more!  Also, I found the pancake was charred too much.  I thought it was bec. it was skillet-style, but I spied another table that received a perfectly un-charred one.  Really enjoyed the creme fraiche and fresh raspberries (please add more!), and the honey on the bottom of the pancake was delightful!  A great dish, really, even w/ the charred bits...  As for the house made biscuit-- well, one look at it and who could ever argue that it wouldn't taste grand??  Crazy-good fennel herb veggie gravy.  Yes, I said \""crazy-good.\""  There's a first time for everything!  :)  \n\nTwo very good meals which will keep St. Francis on my (long) rotation list!  (BTW, I think I heard Mom sigh when I told her where I was having brunch while she was getting ready work... I really wished I could've taken her w/ me!)\n\np.s.  Not only did I not get a chance to SEE Rowland and his band play, but for the majority of my stay, the band actually took a break!  No doubt they were all enjoying some of the great-looking cinnamon rolls...  Next time, I'm going to wait for a table to open on the main floor.  That cork flooring upstairs has to go!"
0,"Three times is my limit for this over hyped, over priced, non unique, and non delicious place. I don't know why so many people recommend it. Its genuinely non special and non memorable. And they charge you extra for tofu even though its replacing meat in the dish. And I got three tiny slivers of tofu in my curry last night. Boring and overpriced."
0,"Back to poor service.  The food was ok, not worse than before but the experience was dreadful. A coupe seated after us got their good, bill, paid, and left before we were midway through our meal. Waiter was barely around.  Yes they have large groups but all that says to me is that the management is poor and they do not know how to schedule staff.\n\nService was so bad the waiter got $0 tip.  We will not be going back here for quite some time, once again.  Shame too because they are the only place I know of that has banoffie pie."
0,"A very below mediocre cafe that people probably go because they are too hung over or there is absolutely nothing else to eat.  Came here with a huge party right before they closed at 2pm.  The service is really slow here and  you'll have to ask for everything twice, that is if you can flag down a waitress and get their attention, but they were nice, just not very attentive. \n\nThe food is not impressive at all.  My pancakes were were dry and I asked for soft scrambled eggs, which still came out looking like regular scramble.  I also ordered a plate of steamed vegetables, you know, so I can eat my veggies for the day.  Little did I know that the whole plate of veggies are completely doused in butter that glistens so much that I can see my own face.\n\nUnless you really have to, there so much good food in Vegas, I'd go elsewhere."
1,"Happy to have a Jersey Mikes in Surprise, AZ. Been here 4 times and the have never disappointed! This location is extremely busy   Yet, they are very good at working through the crowds."
0,"Really disappointed. Entrance is odd, no one greeted us. I was expecting some yummy southern food, other than ribs, there is nothing. Most women don't eat ribs because they are too messy.  Maybe even shrimp and grits, but instead there was a monte cristo or egg salad sandwich on the dinner menu ?  There is nothing interesting on the menu that I cant find somewhere else. Really unfortunate because they could be \""different\"", instead of run of the mill. We left as we weren't interested in a boring meal."
1,"I have no idea what I was thinking ordering oatmeal AND splitting \""The Kitchen Sink\"" with Don. That was just way too much food to handle. For those of you that don't know. \""The Kitchen Sink\"" pretty much has everything in it. I can't even tell you what the ingredients are because the description just says. \""For adventurers only, this one really has it all.\"" It's also the only omelet on the menu that comes in a size large and you can't get it in any other size. \n\nMy oatmeal came out right away. It was in a regular size bowl with raisins, brown sugar, butter, and cream on the side. I mixed everything in and started chowing down. To be honest, this was the first time I've ever ordered oatmeal anywhere. I normally just eat oatmeal at home and feel like it's overpriced at restaurants, but I was craving it and it was only $2.99 (a great value for the amount you get). The texture was nice. It wasn't too thick, too watery, or too grainy, just right. I ate about half of it when the omelet came out. It was seriously huge and literally had EVERYTHING in it. It doesn't say it on the menu, but Mamie P. stated down below that it's made with SIX eggs. No wonder it's giant. I saw carrots, bell peppers, mushrooms, chili, hotdogs, cheese, bacon, ham, turkey, onions, broccoli...I'm guessing everything that's listed as ingredients for all the other omelets is in this omelet. It also come with spuds on the side and you choice of carbs, e.g. tortillas, toast, English muffin, pumpkin bread, or banana nut bread. We went with the banana nut, which was delicious and fresh. The spuds look like potato chips, but they're thicker and soft. Don is a potato freak, so he enjoyed them. The omelet was just a little too much for me, especially after eating half of my oatmeal. Don't get me wrong, it was pretty tasty with the mixture of all the meats and veggies, but I was just too full to enjoy it. If we ONLY ordered the omelet, I think I would've really liked it. Don enjoyed the amount of mushrooms it had in it and the Filipino in him really loved the hotdogs as well. I really suggest you only get \""The Kitchen Sink\"" if you're splitting it between at least two people and that's all you're ordering. You should also be fine with the amount of random ingredients that are in it. It's kind of like an \""ghetto\"" omelet in which everything is just thrown into. \n\nAll in all, I like this place. The menu is very broad, they have about 40 or so omelets, and the service is fast and friendly. I noticed there were a lot of regulars when I went, so it almost felt like having breakfast at someone's house (not in an awkward way). When we were walking out I even noticed a cookie jar that was just like the cookie jar my mom had in our kitchen when I was little (http://s3-media3.ak.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/s4JjYgLO5dGUUV9Op4YBrw/l.jpg). It was literally the same exact one. I didn't say anything, but ten seconds later, Don said, \""Dude, that's the same cookie jar my mom had when I was little.\"" So we learned that we had something in common as kids. Next time, I'll stick to a smaller omelet though, or maybe stuffed French toast and definitely another piece of their banana nut bread ;)"
0,"I am giving one star for Zach the waiter and one star for Heather the Manager..... I eat gluten free due to my health issues.  I went here specifically because they cater to the GF crowd.  That being said after the time I had I am rather worried because if they are as GF cautious as they are about HOW they cook: Meh, not so confident!!!\n\nI started out with a side salad with their house Creamy Parmesan dressing.  The dressing was quite tasty but the salad was less than fresh.  It was plentiful with carrots, thinly sliced celery and some other items but the romaine lettuce was extremely brown and had that taste which told me:  I AM NOT FRESH!  Honestly, it was so brown I just told him to take it away.\n\nHe suggested I try soup instead so I had him bring me some lentil soup which was really very good.  It made up for the salad.  My Iced Tea was good as well.   The hubs got a Magharita Pizza which he said was very good.  The basil and tomato were very fresh and good but there was not much mozz on it at all.  The dough was perfectly done.\n\nThis restaurant prides itself on being a \""from scratch kitchen\"" and they encourage changes to menu items if needed.  That being the case, I ordered the Pollo Rosa Maria, which is grilled chicken breast stuffed with Fontina and Prosciutto, with mushrooms in a lemon butter sauce.  I didn't want the lemon butter sauce so they were going to replace it with the Marsala wine sauce...this was Zach's suggestion, by the way!\n\nUpon getting my entree, which was two very small breasts, it was in the butter lemon and not marsala sauce.  I sent it back............and what came back?  My same chicken breast, which now tasted like a very lemony chicken breast which also had marsala on it.  If you've had either of these versions the one thing you would note is:  They taste horrible together!  It sucked.\n\nSo I told Zach that they had just given me back the original breast with new sauce and he said:  Well, it would take too long to remake the whole thing so he just put it back on the grill to grill off the lemon sauce and then replaced it with the Marsala.  WHAT???  Really??\n\nUm, I just said FINE. and told the hubs we will NEVER be back.  The next thing I know, Heather, a manager is stopping by the table.  She says, \""I hear things aren't going well today....\"" and I then told her our story.  She then states that not only has she taken my entree off the bill but she is making me the corrected version to go and giving us a gift certificate to come back and give them another try.\n\nWell, I am impressed a bit by this.  Taking it off the bill was nice but adding the additional two \""gives\"" made it almost okay.  It's too bad they just couldn't have made it a five star experience the first time....but given that they were so generous, I'll at least give them the chance to do it right.\n\nTo be continued.............."
0,"Saturday night they all come out ot play.  This was my first time here and I was kind of enamored with the whole \""old bank\"" deal.  The vibe and people are what make this joint worth it.  Oh and the $5 martinis. The service...oh the service.  You would get your food faster by going to the grocery store, going home cooking and brining it then you would relying on the service...oh and they are not especially friendly either.  The food was pretty good though, once served."
1,"My friend Janet and I loved our meal here. The ingredients were fresh and properly prepared The food is distinctive. And it's cheap. What's not to love?\nFor our meal we both got wontons and I got beef, pork and chicken tacos. We split a beef tostada.\nWhile the chicken and pork were both good, the beef is the star here. And it was fantastic on the fusion tostada. The tostada has great, fresh toppings but instead of a corn or flour tortilla it came on something made out of rice. and the whole rice grains were still visible. I think any trip here should include a fusion tostada.\nJanet tried a tofu taco since her husband is a pescetarian and she said it was quite good too. \nThe only misfire for me was the mango/passionfruit iced tea. I don't get the flavors. Janet got one too and said she liked it.\nService was excellent. They were really hustling. We got there just before the lunch rush.\nI would love to come back to KoMex and explore the menu."
0,"Just as an FYI, this company is now going by the name ABM Appliance Repair, INC. Still the same crappy service just a \""new name\"" to make their profile look better for the Home Warranty Company."
0,We got a couple of pulled pork sandwiches that came with one side each. We got beans and potato salad. Very dissappointed the pork was so dry and the buns were semi hard. After dousing them with 21/2 packets of sauce it wasn't bad. The sauce was good but the sides weren't anything special. I can get the same at walmart. For the $ price I would go someplace else. $20 for everything. I guess the que for 2 would've been better. It will be long time before I come back.
0,Food is horrible. Nobody in my party enjoyed their sandwich. The floor was greasy. The menu was wet and sticky.
1,The staff was extremely nice and the food was great. From first impression it looks like a whole in the wall but don't let that detour to from trying the amazing food.
1,4 legged friends gets 10 stars. Dr. Ferguson and all her fantastic associates are outstanding individuals. I have been going there a very long time and they continue to exceed all my expectations. Thanks for being so caring with all of my 4 legged friends.\n\nPhil and Lynda Saladino
1,Our fave place. Service superb. Food Delicious! Reasonable price. DELICIOUSNESS!!
0,"I stopped in to give them a heads up that me and some friends would be stopping by the next day on a bike ride (2pm on a Saturday), to which the manager flat out said we were not welcome. Huge blow and they missed out. I'd say better luck next time, but you not only lost me as a customer, but you lost all of our business that day and for the future."
1,"When it comes to chain delivery pizza, Hungry Howie's and Papa Johns take all. Hungry Howie's is good fast pizza. But realistically I think that it takes the cake because of the crust selections! \n\n-Original\n-Ranch\n-Cajun\n-Onion\n-Garlic Herb\n-Butter\n-Butter Cheese\n-Sesame.\n\nThe fact that you get to choose your crust is a genius concept and I would take Howies over Pizza Hut, Dominos, and most other big pizza chains."
0,We had good service that's where it ended. Food was bland and pretty tasteless. Lobster rolls were more bread than lobster and then had no flavor. Todd's Tacos had no seasoning and a weird sauce that shouldn't be on Mexican food.  Would not go back.
0,"It bugs me when i know what i want to order and they start telling me a 5 minute story of what state the fish came from, how it was caught, how they prepare it, how their experienced chefs cook it, and so on.... \n\nService was horrible....entered with a buddy of mine and they made him go back to his car to put on a long sleeve or jacket.  Host had PMS for sure.  Food was undercooked and displayed very sloppy.  No one looks when you need service but when you wanna be left alone, some waiter comes out to ask you how your food was, etc.  Bread sent out was stale...."
0,This is for the miserable excuse for a cafe and it's glum staff. The most depressed tuna melt I have eaten in my life.
1,"The portions here are huge.  I was a bit sick this time around so all I had was the mango salad.  Can't review it this time around since my taste buds are off, but the salad was still good considering I was sick.  Will update it next time I'm in vegas."
0,"Will not stay here again.  This was our honeymoon trip.\n\n1.)  We made reservations for 3 nights and decided to add another one a little later so it came up in there system as 2 reservations - makes sense - they said this would not be a problem...lol...after our \""first reservation\"" night was over apparently the room service thought we were supposed to be gone and tried to come into our room in the middle of the night, not only once, but twice....scaring the living you-know-what out of me.  Obviously communication was lacking.\n\n2.)  When my husband went out to see who was trying to come into our room he took his key with him and found out that our keys were disconnected, meaning we needed to get new room keys.  We were told at the front desk there wouldn't be any problems with this, not the case.\n\n3.)  When we got our new keys we were told that we wouldn't be debited another safety deposit, but when we got our bill we were debited $128 and $200...once again, not what we expected.\n\n4.)  We came in to see the Mayweather fight and we initially booked a King bed and we believe when we booked the second reservation there were move reservations made thus we got a smaller room, thus for the entire stay we were give the smaller room despite the majority of the time was on the original booking with the bigger room.\n\n5.)  Room was dark, small, smelled, the trendy heavy glass shower and toilet were right next to each other and was a little uncomfortable if you know what I mean...also opening and closing the doors was annoying since they were quite heavy and made a loud clanging noise when they shut.  Lighting was poor and b/c we had the smaller room the head of our bed was against our jail size window.  Amenities were lacking, extremely slow internet, dial-up would have been faster and no coffee maker or fridge.  We don't drink but there was no mini-bar either.  I think we were supposed to be on the non-smoking floor but you could have fooled me!\n\n6.)  So when we checked out our bill was severely incorrect, I believe I was on hold for about 45 min before we could get the bill reconciled.  Also there were these odd \""resort fees\"" that we were mysteriously charged....apparently it was b/c we would have had access to the business center, the cardio room, and to receive a USA today daily...lol...don't think I saw anyone with a USA Today.  And to be honest I am not real confident that this will be my last discussion with them.  \n\nAll in all, not an impressive place to stay, bad service, no great amenities, horrible communication, no one seemed to care about your stay, don't do it, unless you just want a place to crash after a hard night of drinking, I would say that is the only thing this place is good for."
1,Yummy taste and fresh ingredients! You can watch them roll out the dough and make it in their wood fire oven. Great prices for what you get!\n\nThey also have an options of beer and wine. If you want something sweet they have gelato...which I would love to try next time. Good option for those close to the Monte Carlo!
0,"The owner was incredibly rude to us, and we are at a loss for why. Perhaps it is because we are tourists and speak little French? Or maybe she doesn't like students? (strange for a college town). We thought we were being respectful -- we said hello with a smile, we handled her (wonderful) books with care, we even asked her questions about where to find books. But she became incredibly agitated when my friend tried to get a book that was a bit higher than we could reach -- she insisted that he just put the book away altogether and escorted him out of the store, as if he had committed a crime. She then promptly turned to me and glowered, obviously wishing to kick me out as well. I was going to buy the book I had been skimming, but felt incredibly uncomfortable with how she was treating us. As I tried to put the book I was holding back, I couldn't recall where it belonged, and she rudely grabbed it from me, muttered something unintelligible in French to my untrained ears, and with that I left to regroup with my friend outside so that we could try and understand what we had just experienced.\n\nIt honestly breaks my heart -- this could have been a memorable little bookstore with a fantastic collection, a collection that the owner is clearly very passionate about, but instead it will be the bookstore where we had the meanest encounter with a book proprietor I have ever encountered."
1,"Okay, it does depend what time you get here. Three stars if you're strolling in here in the evening, and a definite four if you walk in during lunch time.\n\nWent in during an evening to scratch the itch with the homie Akk from Stain Tattoo next door. I get my regular three items whenever I venture into a Filipino restaurant. Sinigang na baboy (pork and veges in a sour tamarind base), Lechon kawali (deep fried pork), and chicharon bulaklak (deep fried pork intestines). \n\nThe sinigang na baboy is up to par. I can't complain. Now since it was in the evening, the sought-after items were down to the last pieces. I'm talking about the lechon kawali and chicharon bulaklak. This can be a good and bad thing all at once. Part of me was glad that there were only pieces left of those two items. I get a few of the kawali and bulaklak. Everything was gone on my first plate. I gets up and tries to get more kawali and bulaklak. All gone for the day. Nick D explains it perfectly in his review. \""Cholesterol at its' finest\"". I swear to God this stuff is bad for you. I liked that they have the secret sauce that makes lechon even more heavenly on every table. Mang Tomas! You my only friend! Their vinegar sauce is one of my favorite sauces between the other Filipino restaurants. Seasoned vinegar with chucks of onions marinating and just waiting to be dunked with unhealthy pieces of chicharon bulaklak. OH MY CHRISTO!!! SUS-MAR-YO-SEP!!! My body was thanking Nanay Gloria's that they were out and was not going to be making anymore the rest of the day.\n\nTHEN, I stroll in here one day during lunch. I had two FULL PLATES of the bad stuff. I had to talk myself into just paying and leaving as soon as possible.\n\nGreat price for a buffet. Definitely a great place for a cheat day from the gym."
0,"I was going to let it pass and not write anything until I got up motivation to give them another chance but after the couple of amazing afterglow reviews I had to write to give warning: \""Your experience may differ. \""  We arrived after 9 and despite their closing at 10, if not exactly feeling of leisure, there was not one of being rushed, though we had a feeling the kitchen was.  Food, 2 pizzas, arrived promptly, one good, the goat cheese pizza, though have had better for less elsewhere, the other with prosciutto, \""extra crispy\"".  Blackened burnt crust utterly devoid of any trace of moisture - dry dry dry.  Hard & brittle. \n\nLiked the general ambiance though rather dark to read the menus and the noise level was rather high.  Service was decent and fast.  After having just recently made first visit to the Parlor however, it was a poor showing by comparison as far as taste & price.  \""Gourmet\"" indeed.   \n\nBased on this one single visit, to paraphrase a quote mis-attributed to Winston Churchill, Humble Pie has much to be humble about.  I'll give them another chance, but probably not until there's another Groupon or Monsoon Deal."
0,"Being that you are in Las Vegas, you know you want one of those big long tall cups to walk around the strip and the casino drinking away your alcoholic beverage ready to give some life to the night. I was sucked into creating this momento in my last Las Vegas visit. I should have asked and checked yelp first but I didn't, if I did, I might not have purchased the Big Chill drink... here are my reasons why:\n\n1. I was totally surprised to see that there was no line to place an order here so I was pretty excited about that. There was only one person working behind the bar and he was very unapproachable. I asked if I was able to taste the flavors prior to purchasing my drink and he said yes so I did. I asked him for his favorites, tasted those and the ones I wanted to try as well. He never in the whole time that I was there smiled at me or even bother having small talk... kinda sad. I did not like that at all.\n\n2. NO DISCOUNTED REFILLS!!!!! With this being said, you will be stuck with a giant cup that just maybe... maybe be able to reuse for like a piggy bank or something. It was pretty lame. I ended up reusing it with my own booze though and then tossed it. Fat Tuesday though does give you the refills for a discounted price.\n\n3. Light alcohol flavor... I like the taste of alcohol, what can I say... unfortunately this drink was light for my taste but not overly sweet so that was a good thing. I paid about $17 bucks for my big chill drink (my flavor was the Blue Ice) for maybe two shots of vodka in it. I guess you can say it was about 8 dollars a shot. This is basically a slurpee with a few shots of booze that will lead to a brain freeze here and there. The husband had a few sips himself and kept mixing the drink around thinking that the alcohol was sitting at the bottom.. to his taste, the alcohol was well mixed in there and he could still taste it. \n\n\nLocation: In the Monte Carlo Hotel and Casino near a Starbucks right when you are gonna go catch the tram to hit up Aria and the Crystal shops. \n\nOne star for an ok tasty slurpee drink and the convenient location."
0,Sadly this place has changed for the worst. I wish I had written a review when I loved this place but now its just disappointing.
0,"The bar staff and the pub was nice enough, but the swath of anti English sentiment, homophobic and sexisist comments left a bad taste. We popped in for a beer on the way home after a sunny day on the shore and realised none of us had been in this bar before. The place is nice enough and the prices are cheap - \u00a36 for 2 pints. It was just the feeling of walking into a cowboy and western bar with the locals all turning round and making it clear you arent from these parts and definately not welcome. Hey ho you live and learn."
1,"Love! Love! Love! This place! My boyfriend and I go here very often! It's again a great first date and for many dates to come! \n\nI'm gonna keep this short:\n\nFor drinks get a Melboc or Cucumber Cooler\n\nFor breakfast get the baked eggs or eggs Benedict \n\nLunch/dinner the salmon,meatballs or chicken\n\nIt's great! Have fun!"
1,"We went here on our one date night of our vacation to Vegas. It was everything we could have wished for and more. \n\nWe had the BBQ Shrimp as an appetizer, shared a salad, he had the rib eye steak and I the Filet Mignon. both of the steaks melted in our mouths. I have never had a steak do that, and I have had a lot of steaks in my time. We had the Country Smashed Potatoes and steamed asparagus as sides. The Steamed asparagus was nothing new, but the potatoes... oh my, they were good. they were like au gratin potatoes with mozzarella cheese. yummo. \n\nBy the time we were done with all of that, sadly, we did not have room for dessert, but that didn't leave us leaving unhappy... it was quite a lovely experience."
1,"So delicious! We had ribs, brisket, and a selection of sides. Absolutely worth the drive from Georgia!!"
1,Came here one afternoon after I stopped in at Hooligans for a quick bite to eat. We were seated right away and our food came out quick. Beers were cold and the wings were good. I also had the cheesesteak sandwich with waffle fries and that very good as well. I actually came here with the intensions of getting the Norwegian Burger after hearing good things and never got a chance to try it. This is a great little place to come to grab a bite if your in the area. The service is fantastic and the food was solid! I look forward to coming back here and trying a few more things that caught my eye. \n\n**Please note - alcohol was consumed at Hooligans prior to eating here lol. I will most certainly update my review if my next few experiences here aren't as good.
1,"Huge fan of sandwich shops and Firehouse is one of my favorite chains.  The meat, bread, and veggies are all high quality and toasted nicely.  My favorite is the hook and ladder but I have tried many and never had a bad sub here.\n\nFirehouse has a couple cool features that set it apart from some restaurants.  First of all, they have a massive hot sauce collection that is rated 1-10 based on spiciness.  Try the Firehouse hot sauce (I believe its called Datil Pepper Sauce).  It is a slightly spicy bbq flavor and really adds a kick to sandwiches.  Most locations also now have Coke Freestyle machines which I think are just plain cool.  \n\nI wish there was a Firehouse closer to me so I could eat here more but for now I will have to stick to tracking them down on road trips."
1,Awesome Staff and great food!!
1,"There's another Mr LG Tits McGee on the scene. Yup-I've had more boyfriends than published reviews on Yelp. Anyway, this time we actually go places, which is nice. I have been searching somewhat fruitlessly for a Mexican place better than Pinto in Glasgow. I think I may have found it, however they don't put any salsa on the Quesadillas, which is a big part of the experience for me. \n\nApparently he had 'booked a table' but when we walked in, it didn't look like the kind of place where you had to book-there were only three tables. \n\nI had chicken quesadillas with black bean salsa. Next time I'd go for a different salsa-because this was more like a hodge podge collection of corn and beans. We also got a side of tortilla chips with the verde salsa. It tasted okay, but I wouldn't choose it again. \n\nI'm giving this a four because of the quesadilla on its own. The spices the chicken were cooked in were bloody great. It was just a great quesadilla. I'm not in Edinburgh very much anymore, but if I am, I'll be here again. However, I'll take away- it's a bit cold inside!"
1,This place is my favorite place to get pizza in Las Vegas. My friends and I have been ordering from here for years! We will actually drive the 20 minutes from home to pick it up because it's that worth it. It's the best NY style pizza outside of NY and the Garlic Knots are to die for! It's a must if you're a local or staying at Red Rock Casino.
1,"Love this place!  Been there twice.  Keep an eye out for the swordfish, if they have it, order it!  They have an amazing wine selection.  If you can't find what your looking for there, you simply don't know what you want.\n\nStaff is excellent.\n\nPrice are high BUT well worth it\n.85709"
1,"Seems like many reviews are complaining about the price, so let me start with this:\n\nUh YEAH, you are in a world class chef's restaurant in LAS VEGAS.  It's going to be pricey!\n\nHaving said that, I thought it was excellent all the way around.  \n\nWe went late, about 9:30pm after the Phantom show.   Plenty of seating available, we had a reservation but didn't really need one for the dining room.  Patio area was full and I do not think you can reserve that.\n\nService was outstanding.  Yes, the food takes a bit of time, but again, you are in a world class chefs house, not Chili's!\n\nI had the free-range chicken which was beautifully cooked.  Everything on the plate was great from the chicken to the veggies.   And I will add, for being \""pricey\"" the portion size was great, a full half chicken and a full plate of garnish and potato.  Sometimes at this type of place you expect a $30 chicken dish to be about 3 ounces of meat and a handful of carrots...not here!\n\nLast time in LV I went to one of Puck's other spots, in Caesars I think but not for sure on the location, and it was not good.   I was a bit hesitant, but wanted to eat in the same place we were seeing the show.   I was not disappointed this time.  Highly recommend!"
0,"Me: \""Do I need a stamp to get back in?\""\n\nTicket taker: \""you can get a wrist band at the snack bar, it's $2\""\n\nAvoid this venue if you can"
0,"Clearly when a new client calls they should be informed of the 3-4 hour timeframe however I assure you this wasn't told to me or you would not have had my business the one time you did.  I'm also concerned that in step one of your \""calming\"" process you say they're  placed in a kennel or \""held down\""?? Also wouldn't have left my dog there with this process.  While I appreciate your taking the time to explain your process I am more convinced than ever that I will never return. \n\nNor will I pay for an \""express service\"" because when I do take her to Cage free grooming and her appointment is at a certain time they stick to their schedule. They don't overload themselves with so many appointments it takes several hours to complete. \n\nBy the way, you really can have a mobile groomer come to your home which is the least stressful way for the same price."
1,"Kobe beef, shaved truffles, foie gras, Madeira sauce. How can you go wrong??!! Oh and a fried egg!!! This was absolutely the best damn burger I have EVER eaten!!!! Forget the $60 price tag... it was worth it!!!! This is one of those bucket list items. Highly recommend everyone have one once in their lives."
0,I can't believe the pool closes at 8pm during summer time. We have to get the mini bar refrigerator unlocked and I understand that it has a sensor and that we have to pay for whatever we take from the mini bar but they should at least provide a small refrigerator for the guests. Oh wait! They do have refrigerators to offer the guests but they will charge $25/night. I can smell the chlorine coming out of the shower heads also and its way too strong. I've been to one of the best hotels here and I thought that this hotel will be better than the other 4-5 star hotels we stayed at.
1,"I love that I don't think many people know this place is here or are too lazy or scared to take an elevator ride. \n\nI love the view.\n\nI love the unique and refreshing libations they created (Lemongrass Mojito, Cucumber Margarita) \n\nI love the excellent service from the polite and personable staff. \n\nI love the atmosphere and low lighting. \n\nI love this bar. \n\nI love that I went there because I saw the first review on Yelp!"
1,"I have to say when it comes to Stingrays sushi and service, they are the best. Some reviews on here talk about the price of the rolls but why on earth would you want to be eating cheap raw food? Their menu is affordable especially during happy hour and the food is awesome. My server, Bri was suggesting items to my blind date who was a sushi virgin and he loved her recommendations. Overall great atmosphere and sushi at Stingray!"
1,"It's rare I give 5 stars, but the tacos here are great. Good service, better music. \n\nUnfortunately, I'm going to go with a 4 star review because the Moscow Mule drink that I received was flat. But I'm willing to give it another shot due to good service."
1,"I like that they lead with warm slices of ciabatta and a dish of bruschetta.  The bread is brushed with a touch of garlic.\n\nWe ordered and shared several dishes:  chicken parmesan which came with spaghetti noodles and a nice marinara.  Cheese ravioli, a nice mild filling of ricotta and spices.  Angel Hair which was ordered with a vodka cream sauce that was also very nice.  And chicken and sausage cacatorri, my favorite.  Lots of chicken medallions, sweet and spicy Italian sausage, red and green peppers, onions and stewed tomato's with a flavorful and robust blend of spices.\n\nThe portions were generous, particularly for the kids meals.  Prices were a little higher than average but the food was well above average.\n\nThe service was great.  Papa Razzini's is not very big so the setting is a little more intimate than many valley restaurants.  I like a cozy Italian restaurant so that works for me.  The have some nice outdoor seating as well.\n\nI know, boring review.  Sometimes I just tell it like it is."
1,"Frequent this place so much that they  should make a plate in honored of my name !\n\ntry the pasta shrimp. Its awesome. Hummus. Greek salad. Greek friends. The burger is amazing. The water is amazing too !( I joke about their plain, same, filtered.water... It is refreshing though)"
0,"Well, had to make yet another police report. One of cars got broken into, items stolen. Gates are open all the time. Feel very disappointed.\n\nHad to call police earlier in the month because someone's disgruntled girlfriend was left here (didn't live here but was in the complex) and was beating on the boyfriends car at 5 am screaming for two hours.\n\nNot what I expected for the idea that was sold to us about living here."
0,Tried this place for lunch since I drive past it near my new place. It was bad.. I had the fried chicken and it was pink. Rest was greasy and didn't taste good. 2 stars for how cheap it was but this place was full of large people who don't know good Chinese and this wasn't good.
0,First of all when you go thru the drive-thru they dont greet you at all. There food is also very greasy. And when your done ordering they never tell the total. How are we supposed to know how much the total is if they dont tell us.
0,"I was really excited to try this new place.  Ordered the  Tonkasu assari combo with the gyoza and salad. Ramen noodles was good ,Soup just a little to salty. Pork is too thin and brakes apart. Decent size , I like it more then monta because monta give you so little noodles that  it doesnt fill you up. Salad was really bland. The dressing was garlic? Ginger? I dont know  what it was but it tasted like nothing,  all I taste is the oil. The gyoza was really bad. I mean I gyoza itself was good. The fillings was good but they cook mine with a dirty pan and the bottom isnt even crispy but its soft and black from a dirty pan. I whipe it on a napkin and it was all black. I dont know ill go back , maybe I more try."
0,"Been here for four hours, still waiting for room that I reserved. Crap service, rude employees, and it hasn't even been one day."
0,I hope this review causes pain.  This is the slimiest place ever. I basically had to go home and redo their piss poor work. The first guy and the guy at the register both have future careers selling used mobile homes in Mesa!!!  Everyone please stop going there now so this corner can have a better use for us all...tumbleweeds maybe?
1,"Fun store! Lots of shoes, country/western wear, hats, belts, etc. I ended up buying a pair of ATS red boots that I've had for a month now, and I still get compliments on every time I wear them out!"
1,"This is more of a 3.5 star, but I will round up, since it is a 24hr spot.\n\nThis is a little bit of everything in Chinatown.  Not only do they prepare decent sandwiches, but they have plenty of other items on the menu including frozen yogurt, fresh baked goods, and boba drinks.\n\nThe food is not mind blowing, but it is pretty decent for the money, and the portions are fair.  Everything I have had tastes fresh, and haven't really had any issues here.\n\nOverall, it is a solid place to eat late at night, but you won't really see me here before midnight, since there are much more places I would rather eat.\n\nSo overall, a 3 star review if you are dining here before midnight...a 3.5-4 star if it is super late and you want something fast and cheap."
1,They are all over Las Vegas and are always great for fresh cook to order Mexican Food. Honestly I only order the 2 beef taco plate with rice and beans. The quality is always consistent and good.
0,"So here is my review not in retrospect but in real time from my experience at Max's\n\nTo start, it isn't good...was seated and waited for 10 minutes just for someone to acknowledge that I was at the table and ask me what I wanted to drink.  No menu at the table and had to ask the greeter to get menu.  Waited almost another 10 minutes for the water\n\nServer came and introduced himself, ordered a sago and lunch. I don't know if the prep work is different in the USA compared to the Philippines but it doesn't take long to pour the drink toss in the jello and tapioca ...the drink itself is really good and just like I would have back in Manila\n\nThe food itself was great...ordered garlic fried rice, half chicken and sisig\n\nHopefully they get it together so that the experience will match the food"
0,"Nope. Not liking this place. I've gone there 3 times just to make sure. Mostly bc we live around the corner and also bc we thought it just might have been the dishes i ordered, or the day of the week...blah, blah, blah. Nope, it really is just that the food isn't really that good or tasty.On the Italian side of the menu, the food was bland. No real depth of flavor. On the mediterian side,\nThe falafel was mushy and tasteless. Not a typical falafel -which I don't mind creativity in presentation, but it has to taste good. Event kids didn't like their kids selection. 3 times a charm for me."
0,"I have to give this place 2 stars solely based on my most recent visit. Normally, I get the orange peel chicken and it has always been good! Recently I've been on a tofu kick so I decided to give the tofu here a try instead of chicken. BAD CHOICE!!! The tofu came out in thin little burnt strips. I also tried the hot and sour soup which was also a disappointment."
0,"Obviously the great rep of this place is their beer selection.  A lot of bottles.  Decent tap selection, though you are guaranteed to have a rather lopsided selection among the taps.\n\nFood is fair; I've yet to go there with others and have our whole meal come out at once.  Salad will come first, then a couple of dogs, then fries.  If you are polite and civil and believe in not eating until everyone is served, well, let's just say that no one ever taught the manager, cooks or servers here that lesson.\n\nNow, their service:  Really lackluster.  \""Entitled\"" is the word I would use.  It pains me to give them 15%, because honestly, they don't earn it, even when I was a regular and knew some of them by name. Meh."
1,This is not your typical outlet location but there is always a sale. I'm a regular at this location and always seem to hit the buy one get one 50% of specials. The shoes are slightly marked down usually $10.00  off the regular price but you really save if you buy more then one pair. Be sure to check with the staff as some items are not included in the buy one get one half off. The back off the store has clearence items. Neatly stacked shelves with many shoe sizes to choose from. The store is clean and easy to move through. The store has purses and other accessories\n\nI have to praise the staff. Never met an employee who works at this location that never looked like they did not want to be there. Every time I walk through the door the sales staff always greets me with a smile. They are all helpful and extermley friendly. No high pressure sales just superior customer service. I feel like I'm walking through the streets of French Qaurter where the streets are filled with friendly people when I walk into this store.
0,"If you're okay with settling for mediocrity, then this is the place for you. \n\nUnsanitary, lazy service. The girl used the same cuticle clipper that she used on my pedicure for the manicure. She didn't even bother to wipe the clippers clean so the collected cuticle bits were trapped away in the crevices of the clippers. \n\nThe \""drying station\"" is a greasy table where everybody places their nails to dry by the distant heat of a dinky light bulb that hangs overhead. You'll be waiting at least an hour if you opt to dry your nails this way as the heat emitted by the light bulb does nothing but shine light on your less-than-great manicure. \n\n\nThere are better, cleaner, FRIENDLIER places."
1,"Dr. Kim is a kind and talented healer.  He has helped me with chronic lower back pain in the past and most recently he helped me get relief for blocked inner tubes which resulted from a sinus infection.  I had been seeking help from my family physician for several weeks with no results, but Dr. Kim helped me find relief after only two sessions.  I leave his office feeling calm, energized and with a sense of well-being.  I have recommended him to all my friends and family.\nThank you, Dr. Kim!"
0,"I am not sure how this is BBQ! And the atmosphere is terrible! No checkered table cloths like in a BBQ joint, liquor, and just plain stale environment! For the food.....horrible! Ordered take out of brisket & chicken sandwiches & they went in the trash. Chicken was dry & cut up in pieces (not pulled) & brisket looked like it was dunked in water with a huge strip of fat. No BBQ flavor at all! In fact, tastes like they add liquid smoke to meat! Gross! Coleslaw was soggy and looked like it had been thawed out and wasn't edible. Beans were like a refriend pile of slop and not edible.  As i was awaiting takeout, i was observing the service which consisted of 2 servers looking stressed out to wait on 3 tables. We won't be back! Not sure they can make it 6 mos. I wish them well but the food is horrible!"
0,"Decided to check this place out tonight after Yard House sported an hour long wait. Can't say that I'd go back... not because it was bad, but because it was just okay. And really, I can get okay a lot of places for a whole lot less. \n\nMike thoroughly enjoyed the multiple flat screen TVs broadcasting the football game. We split a small specialty pizza- 1/2 meatball & ricotta, 1/2 white. The pizza was sort of bland and their signature burnt crust really wasn't my bag, especially since I'm a crust girl. \n\nThe menu is small and items seem a little pricey for what you're getting. I generally like to rate places on craveability and I can't say this is a place I'd ever crave. I think there are better places to go..."
0,"Did you see the short guy walk in with a group of people last night, stop, look around then walk out......if not, that was me. \n\nSo, listen I understand wanting to make this place different than the original cheers. But when you build it to look EXACTLY like TAILGATERS, you clearly aren't separating yourself from the rest of the bars off of bell road. \n\nI walked in, saw how the light were bright, neon, fucking neon lights, and metal walls, i nearly threw up in my mouth. \n\nI walked over from RTO's which is where I hangout, and in my opinion the only good bar off of bell aside Santisis now a days. \n\nNo I didn't grab a beer, or check out how the service was, because after walking in I was so disgusted and sad to see what this place has become, I just left with my head hanging. \n\nSorry Owners, you just turned cheers into tailgaters.\n\n----Response to Tim, the owners comment---\n\nLook bud, I understand you wanting to run a successful business man. And yes there were people there. Which you are correct, a lot of older people seem to like it. And if that's the type of crowd you want to attract, well then you might be successful. As far as the demographic between the ages of 23-36, I don't feel it's going to be successful. \n\nI was with a group of people, mostly women, they went to the bathroom, came back as I waited at the bar and they and I quickly agreed lets get the hell outta here and go back to RTO's. \nLook man, I'm trying to give you helpful constructive criticism. Because A LOT of people in my age range loved the old cheers. So you're already fighting a uphill battle. We all love the area and are sad to see so many bars go with the tide in this economy, we just want a great place, that's DIFFERENT from the rest to park our buts on the weekends and take out minds off of whatever. \n\nI wont be coming back unless it's the last choice on my list of places."
1,"was recommended by a girlfriend whose nails looked amazing.  Mike did a great job with my specifications.. they are perfect.. acrylic is thin and narrow... the polish job is fab.  he made sure i was entirely dry before i left.  and they removed old acrylic, gave me a full set for 30.  very reasonable.  i will def. be back.  ps.  i heard his wife cindy is great also.  but i would make an appt."
0,"Arizona Mills has the worst bathrooms I have ever been in. They are always really, really smelly and warm.\n\nI like that there are outlet stores, so you can save a lot of money, but at the same time some of the stores they have are really ghetto and a lot of the outlets have ghetto items.\n\nThe mall is always really packed and there are a ton of kids running around. People walk on the wrong side of the mall, or walk in large groups that prevent people from getting by.\n\nAnd the worst part: there are at least ten different cell phone kiosks and you get badgered every time you walk by. They wont leave you alone. They also have two or three of those carts that sell lotion. I have had people chase me into stores trying to get me to buy natural sea potions. It's just annoying and always makes my shopping experience uncomfortable."
0,"Applebees quality, Capital Grille prices.  Would not go back at half the price."
1,Good food.  They have Oban scotch.  I had the gnochi after a bruschetta appetizer.  Service was good.
0,"It's been a while since I've been here.  We came by to get some of our favorite snacks and some ramen.  We had tonkotsu ramen, vegetable tempura, shrimp tempura, karage and some sushi ( hamachi, maguro, albacore).  \n\nThe tonkotsu ramen was ok.  There was a chunk of tough pork in the middle of the pot which I decided to avoid after gnawing on the first bite for a minute.\n\nThe karage was a bit soggy which made me sad because that crunch is just as important as the flavor to me.\n\nVegetable tempura was ok. I wish I could tell you about the shrimp but it never showed up.\n\nSushi is something I am very passionate about. Sushi is a contender with my mother's fried chicken as my last meal. So as not to be too offensive, all I'm going to say about the sushi I had tonight was it was the worst I've had here.\n\nDissapointment is bitter."
0,"I give up.  This joint smells great from the street but The pizza tastes like shit. The waiter must have been having a sales contest as he kept pushing a 60 dollar bottle of wine.....to wash down this swill?  The red sauce has no flavor. The garlic will leave you reeking for hours. The salads are ok, nothing special. I guess, if you have kids and need to eat this is alright but not a destination by any stretch."
1,"best steak EVER  EVER  EVER\ncajun rib eye ......juicy .. tasteful .... cooked to perfection\n\ngreat service \n\nafter bad experience at McCormick & Schmick's ... it was completely the opposite here\n\nCody was my server ... happy guy with outgoing personality .. attentive but not overbearing....\n\nthe manager was exceptional .......\n\npricey but well with it\n\nCody recommended the fresh spinach salad .. I'm not a salad guy but this was exceptional, diced salad and vinaigrette, chopped bacon, diced egg .....it was great!!\n\nif there are better steaks .... i'm truly scared to eat them.\n\nN -  JOY!"
1,"I recommend this place, but have not gone here recently.  My daugther loves the sushi here. So when she's in town, I take her here.  \n\n-Place is quiet usually.  Been here for lunch and dinner, never busy.\n-Couple of TV's and since it's quiet enough, I'm usually able to change the channels. \n-Always great service here.  \n-Price is average, but the sushi is fresh.\n-AYCE on par with most.  \n\nWhat I've Tried:\n-Tiger Roll:  My favorite\n-Lasagna Roll:  Not too bad, just bad for you.\n-Golden California:  My daughter's favorite. \n-Utah Roll:  My 2nd Favorite\n-Teriyaki Chicken:  Tasty\n\nThis place use to have one fo the cheapest AYCE lunch specials (around $12).  Last time I was here, it' was gone.  Hopefully it comes back."
1,"Best place for a boba fix! Great milk tea with decent price. Drinks have the right amount of ice and syrup comparing to other Boba places (which give u almost a whole cup of ice with either too much or too less syrup). Location is central in town square and easy to stop by, pick up a drink, and continue shopping or whatnot. Workers are friendly and drinks don't usually take too long to be made and served. Overall, if you are looking for a quick boba fix, lollicup is the place to go!"
0,"Yeah, seriously, the busses that get you from the airport to the rental car center are dramatically under provisioned.  BAD EXPERIENCE.\n\nThe cars at Avis are typically dirty but at least reservations are honored."
0,"Was here recently and service was terrible plus food was not as tasty as it has been at other Macaroni Grills I have been to.  Our waitress disappeared for a good 20 minutes before she even brought us water.Took forever to get our food and it was mediocre.  I was really surprised because I have eaten at several Macaroni Grills in valley, Tucson and in other states."
1,"I was chillin with the homies a couple weeks ago and we stopped by this hole in the wall to get some Korean food. You would not expect this place to have Korean food if you just drove by the place. I only found out about this place cause my homie is a regular.\n\nI ordered the Bi Bim Bop, which is beef, rice, veggies and a fried egg. We wanted to dine-in but we got there 10 minutes before they were closing. We decided to get old school and picked up some cold ones and ate our food at the park. There was a lot of food and it tasted good for a hole in the wall.\n\nI will come back to try their Kimchi Soup."
0,"Good food....horrible service....worse management. I can't grasp the whole \""we don't have servers assinged\"" bit. \""We want everyone to feel welcomed so we have everyone waiting on you\"" bs! That's the worst way to run a restaraunt. Every time I've been they've forgotten part of our order and/or just ignorred us. Id rather eat at Liberty Market across the street. I've spoken to managment about the bad service and all the gal has done is make excuses. That's not how you run a place. I believe in word of mouth...and the words out of my mouth to everyone I know is not to patron this location."
1,"Moved back to the east coast and am sorely missing my 24 hour fitness membership - especially the cost and the classes.  I've been a member of various gyms over the last decade, and 24 hour fitness seems to go the farthest in making sure its members are happy, are not restrained by high costs or contracts, and have choices in equipment and classes.  If they open one in DC, I'm sure they'll snatch away business from the other fitness centers here in no time!  Reason for 4:  pay for towels, not completely nationwide yet, and the machines aren't as nice as some of the fancier gyms."
1,"Love this place!  Simply, yet delicious!!"
0,Ok so I LOVE Cheesecake Factory but I was so unhappy with my visit today I could not post about it. The food was good as always and service was good for being so busy but when the girl asked to bag up my food I was like ok.... I wish I would have done it myself... I gave her a plate with 1.5 sandwich and full fries and ketchup and ranch... I look at my to go food once I got back to work and all I had was 1/2 sandwich and 1/2 fries... I had weightloss surgery so I cant eat a lot at 1 time but if im gonna pay full price for meals I want my WHOLE meal I didn't eat to go.... SUPER unhappy with CCF today!! Shame on the waitress!!
0,I am a hugeeee sweets lover so I was pumped about this place...unfortunately I was let down. Me and my girlfriend split a big ice cream sundae surrounded by cookies. The ice cream was nothing special and the cookies were so stale!! What a let down. Should have done there famous frozen hot choc I guess
0,"What a mistake.soooooo disappointing. I decided to go inside to order & it looks like these people are actually living here. The kids wee running around , their bicycles parked in the corner, the TV blaring something on Cartoon Network and the people in the kitchen just laughing and playing around. I ordered the Beef & Broccoli combo, fried won tons and wor won ton soup. It came pretty quickly but once I got it home and tore into it it was just plain awful, the egg roll tasted like it was made of spoiled cabbage, the beef was thin & slimy very rubbery and I never even tried the broccoli or rice. The Wor Won ton soup was hot but everything was overcooked, the shrimp were tough & rubbery, the pork was missing, and the won tons were not cooked all the way too. The only thing good here was the sweet & sour sauce I dipped my fried won tons into. I would not go back here, Chinese fast-food should not be this bad."
0,"So, let me start by saying that the unprofessional manner in which the floor MANAGER conducted himself, was inexcusable.  After filling out the form to sit through the 2 hour presentation, I find out that I marked the incorrect income box on the sheet.  So what do they do, NOTHING!  My friend and I explain the mix up but to no avail.  The manager comes out to tell us that there is nothing he can do with this huge smirk on his face.  \n\nWe were so pissed off that they had us drive all the way out there and would not even listen to the fact that I made a simple error!  The guy I was with was very upset and the manager proceeds to provoke him by saying \""Are you gonna get in my face?\""  \""You wanna hit me, go ahead.\""  SO NOT PROFESSIONAL!  Take your pin stripe suit and your smirk and walk away like a true manager would have done.  Needless to say, this was the worst experience I've had with Worldmark.  Thanks a lot Dan and by the way, learn how to act like a true professional, not a child."
0,"Mediocre at best. We happened to drive through the area and wanted to stop for a bite. We saw it had decent reviews and we love Columbian food so we entered with high hopes. The decor is typical for a Columbian restaurant on Albemarle Rd.\n\n\nTo start we had beef empanadas which were fried well and not overly greasy, well priced but not what we came for.\n\nFor entrees we had Carne Asada and the obvious signature dish, a whole rotisserie chicken. The Carne asada was under seasoned and sliced so thin that we could  have ordered it from the deli counter. Rice and beans were fine, but not what you would go for.\n\nThe rotisserie chicken was seasoned well, moist and priced right.  We would consider returning for takeout but it's not much better than the 5 dollar Harris Teeter bird. \n\nMaduros were on point as a side as were the chicorones.\n\nThere's just too much competition to return here often."
0,"Horrible Food don't waste your money\n\nThis is the worse cardboard covered cheese & sauce so called pizza I've ever had, I haven't had this garbage since grade school cafeteria food, Most of the reviews on here rant about what a great place this is how much fun you'll have there. IDK where that place is cuz the one I wan in today in East Liberty by the Home Depot was getto beyond belief the food is bad & the people aren't nice & friendly.\n\nLoudness is an issue there when the lottery area has a sign saying because of back round noise your number may be wrong. Not one person there had decent customer service skills I had to ask the girl 3 times to speak up and I have excellent hearing. I ordered a small pizza I got a medium that was greasy on top but the crust was stale. \n\nI looked forward to getting some great pizza man this place really disappointed me today."
1,I'd go back to this place. We stopped in on a whim to find a place to eat while driving down Chandler Blvd. We turned the corner onto the side street and had choice of 2 BBQ places there as another place just next door. So happened we turned left and not right into rudys. Never being there caught us off guard as we didn't know the proceedure on the operation of the joint. Watching we caught on winding up to the counter to order we passed many bottle drinks in ice and a refer with sides. In line we made it to the order desk and got our beef or pork order. It doesn't say much about what one orders but it is by the 1/2 lb. or the sandwich. The food was good and  after the cleanup easy as they have a novel wash up sink for those with hands sticky with BBQ sauce. \nThe 2 of us spend $20 with no drinks. We drink water when out as so much profit is in soda drink which are bad for one anyway. I don't like drinking candybars.
1,"i can review mamma mia?  yay!  \n\nso cute!  the story is a bit cheesy, but the songs are so fun!  \""dancing queen\"" just made me think of our AJ singing karaoke at 25si.  i only knew less than half the songs, but i still loved the show.  it's just really \""cute\"".  i went with a girlfriend which was a good thing.  i wouldn't make a guy see this show.      \n\nmy favorite part was in the end, after the curtain call, they came back and performed 3-4 of their most popular songs.  it was like being at an ABBA concert!\n\nmy gripe: you know you're in vegas when the concession stand isn't really a concession stand.  they only serve cold drinks....like alcohol.  when we asked for hot tea or coffee (which i needed because the theater was ice cold) they said no hot drinks.  ugh."
0,"Poor service, slow to get food and drinks. When we finally received food most of ours were cold."
0,"I had a bridesmaid's dress altered here and was very disappointed.  It wasn't THAT complicated of an alteration either and I'm not all that picky.  The dress had a 'sash' around the waist and when I had to get the dress hemmed, in turn the 'sash' needed to be brought up so it was the same length as the dress.  Despite 2 attempts to get this point across, the alteration was never made.  Additionally, the way the 'sash' hung in the back, when the dress got taken in on the sides the first time, nothing was done to adjust the 'sash' and then I had the thing hanging way to the left, almost on my side instead of hanging straight down my back.\n\nOk, maybe the 'sash' thing was complicated?  But beyond that issue, the hem was done terribly.  It was a tee length dress and the hem was done so poorly that it was 'bunched' weird in several locations so that it didn't lay flat.  Not to mention when I picked up the dress, there were still white fabric pencil marks all over the bottom of it where they marked the hem and never bothered to remove it when they were done.  \n\nI also specifically had to ask for the dress to be pressed when they were done.  I wouldn't have really expected to have to do this and i would not have cared that they didn't except that with the hem not done well, before pressing it it looked horrendous....at least pressing it helped to sort of make the hem lay flat.  \n\nBasically, I didn't feel like any of this was done well and even though the lady seemed a little embarrassed that her help didn't do a good job on this dress, she also didn't seem to care very much either.  She acted very annoyed that i needed additional alterations after the first attempt...when second alterations were mostly only necessary b/c of the bad job they did the first time.  \n\nMaybe this place is fine for simple stuff like hemming pants and the like, but i wouldn't trust a dress for a wedding with them again!"
0,"took my wife and 3 kids for breakfast at dinner time. The employees were very nice and helpful but....my wife found a long hair in her eggs, they forgot to take the kids meals off the cost (kids eat free happy hour) I gave the waiter $10 for being so polite but then they charged my card twice. I then sat on hold for 10 minutes the following day to try to resolve. the manager said I would have to bring my bank statement in so she could send it to corporate and get it fixed. What a nightmare."
1,"Possibly some of the freshest Sushi I've eaten in Las Vegas.. I tried the Blue Fin Toro, Blue Fin nigiri, Unagi, Hawaiian Roll, and a couple others I can't remember.. Everything was delicious and the staff was beyond friendly.. I can't wait to visit them again and sample some more tasty Sushi!!"
0,"Bar none, this is the most disorganized business I have ever seen. The customer service was almost non-existent. \n\nMistakes are completely understandable. Shit happens and nobody is perfect. But when the same business makes more than three major mistakes in a row I wonder how it is still standing amidst all the competition. \n\nPoor customer service example #1:\nI called Naughty Nails about a month ago and left a really excited message because I was pumped to find a \""well-reviewed\"" place I could visit at odd hours. I would have gone there a month ago, except nobody bothered to return my call.\n\nThe lack of a return call does not even factor into this review. It just adds to my point about how this is the most disorganized and poorly managed business I have ever seen.\n\nPCS #2:\n\nI set up an appointment yesterday for midnight after my flight arrived in LAS. I'm getting married in several days and my schedule is packed every day until my wedding so I have limited time to get everything done. I talked to the lady on the phone yesterday morning for 5-10 minutes explaining the flight situation and she said midnight was fine and she would book the appointment. Lo and behold, I show up at midnight on the dot and nobody is there. \n\nBaffled, I call the main line. The woman on the phone apologizes and tells me the nail tech left. I told her I had an appointment and explained my situation (limited time, wedding) and she apologized again and offered me 50% off my service to make up for it and set up a new appointment for this morning. That woman who I spoke with on the phone is the only person who knew anything about customer service. I wasn't too bothered that no one was there because she handled the situation well and took care of me. Naughty Nails once again had a clean slate with me, until I came back the next morning...\n\nPCS  #3:\n\nI meet Stephanie. She has to ask when my appointment is because evidently she didn't know. She also didn't know about my discount. Disorganized...poor communication within the business...but still no big deal. She is friendly and sets me up to get a pedicure. During my pedicure and manicure, her phone is straight BLOWING UP. I shit you not. She stops to talk to her grandma, she stops to text, buzz buzz buzz. I'm sorry, is my pedicure interrupting your life? Am I paying you for a service or just getting in the way of your abounding social life? It must take a SERIOUS lack of common sense to think it is OK to TEXT in the middle of a SPA SERVICE. This blew my f*cking mind 1000 times over. It's like me paying for a massage and the masseuse interrupts the service to chat on her phone and send texts while the phone is producing obnoxious noises for the entire 2.5 hour process (because in this case, that's how long it took for a mani/pedi!!). IT IS JUST AS BAD TO DO THIS DURING A PEDICURE!! How is this not obvious?!?! I mean C-O-M-E  O-N! I was pressed for time and had to work at noon. My appointment was at 9:30am. I was late for work. During the pedicure when she was texting I said \""I'm not sure if we will have time to do both...I have to work at noon\""...and that's the only reason she stopped texting. Absolutely ZERO respect for my time. HUGE NO-NO. This is a mortal sin of any spa-related business. I was stressed and anxious the entire time. \n\nPCS #4\n\nAt 11:00a.m. a group of three girls come in. At around 11:15 they ask if it will be much longer. Stephanie asks them what time their appointment is and they say 11. She responds \""Oh, I have it in my book as 11:30\"". Another example of the horrendous disorganization. AND also another huge customer service fail. Anyone working in hospitality should know that the customer is always right (even if they are wrong!). She could apologize for the delay, for the misunderstanding, for SOMETHING just to let them know she cares a little bit. She tells them she will be done in 20 minutes. Realistically we are done at noon. She stops midway to get them set up with the pedicure water, which means I am going to get to work late. I understand why she would want to get them going but where is everybody!?!? There is no way she is going to do manicures and pedicures on three girls with the same appointment time by herself. What is going on here!?! What a hot, hot, burning MESS!!\n\nPCS#5 \n\nI'm finally done, and WITH the 50% off my service is $50. So it's $100 for a mani/pedi here? That's unheard of...but I needed to pay and leave for work. I pull out my credit card only to discover (ha-ha...discover, like the card!) that their credit card has been down for a while and I have to go get cash. I straight up told her I don't have time because I'm already going to be late. They tell me I have to come back at 2:30a.m. after I work a double and pay. LO AND BEHOLD...NO ONE THERE when I come back to pay\n\nUNBELIEVABLE!\nAnd my nails were mediocre at best--a bit sloppy with little attention to detail, rough shaping, and poor manicuring.\n\nTHE END...never again!! OMGx100278237^10000!!"
1,"Came here on a Saturday night at around 11:30 pm with small group of 4. Fortunately, my friend got us on the guest list so we got to wait in the shorter line on the right side of the entrance. There was a cover of $10 for guys and ladies were free I believe.\n\nThere is a dress code. So for guys, I would say a MINIMUM is a nice pair of jeans, non-tennis shoes, and collared shirt. I did see some guys suited up, so if that's your style you won't be too left out. Most of the ladies I saw inside were dressed pretty well with short, sexy dresses and heels. \n\nOnce we got inside, it was pretty packed. Still got a drink (a bit overpriced) in a reasonable amount of time though. The DJ was really good and played a mix of EDM and R&B/Hip Hop. I appreciated it. I can only fist pump for so long. \n\nThe bathroom is clean and unisex. I was really confused at first when I walked in, but quickly figured it out. The men's urinals is behind a wall so you aren't in full view of the women's side (fortunately or unfortunately? Up to you I guess.) \n\nThe outside patio seemed nice, but once I stepped out, I got hit by a wave of smoke from everybody smoking cigarettes and quickly walked back inside. \n\nLeft around 1 am, and the place was still pretty packed and lots of people were dancing. \n\nOverall, with the decor, ambiance, crowd, and music, it reminded me of one of the nicer clubs I would see in Vegas or LA. Would go here again. Like other reviewers said though, get your name on some kind of guest list though. The general admissions line is just way too long."
1,Great service and friendly staff. Stopped in looking to buy my first leather motorcycle jacket. They were very helpful.
0,"Breakfast is good and good value.  The dinner is horrible. The food is not restaurant quality.  I was surprised that the Carbonara was so heavy and it was something that amazed me that the F&B manager would allow on the menu. It was just so surprising that the quality was so bad. Nothing special what so ever here.  And the waitstaff will fill your table with soda glasses so drink up!   Don't you love it when wait staff bring you the soda when THEY want to rather when YOU need it. \n\nThe food does not match the decor in any way.  The menu is good/interesting/nice, but the quality of the food does not live up to the menu, decor and everything else. \n\nGo somewhere else."
0,"HORRIBLE experience in every way possible!  Olives has always been our go to place every time we go to Vegas which is about 4 times a year!  This time it was my birthday week and I wanted to show off Olives to my family.  We arrived at 12:05 and were seated inside.  Waiter finally came over and took our drink orders.  The bread and olive tapenade were slow to arrives as well.  Our food orders were taken and we waited, we waited, we waited...the order was taken at 12:20!!!  As I was waiting I needed more water...the bussers (4 of them) were gathered around the wait station having face to face conversations with each other completely ignoring not only me but, the rest of the customers.  My husband had to get up go over tap one on the shoulder to finally get water refills.  Our food was served and all of the dishes were cold.  Three flat breads cold, chicken/beef skewers cold, my trout cold with limp gooey french fries (not fresh cut ones either).  We had to get up and find the waiter and told him our food was cold. Of course he acted so surprised.  He took my trout and the skewers and 15 mins later returned with the food.  The kitchen had recooked a trout and PUT IT ON TOP OF THE COLD FRIES FROM BEFORE!  Also, did the same thing with the skewers...so bad that the first skewer he had taken a bite off of was STILL ON THE PLATE!  Once again had to wave down the waiter. and showed him.  He came back and said that the busser told him he had thrown out the first order and that my husband was wrong.  CALLED HIM A LIAR basically!  I was so pissed at this point.  The waiter said he was getting us chocolates to make up for it.  We waited another 30 friggen' minutes for these damn chocolates and we finally got up and went to the bar to get our check.  We saw the waiter go to the manager, some woman, and talk to her.  We figured he was telling her a big made up story about how we were wrong or something.  I went to her and told her what had happened and I was furious at this point.  She showed no emotion, gave no explanation but, took her sweet ass time to ring up the check! I told her that we shouldn't have even been charged for the drinks or anything it was such a horrible experience.  She just gave me a dead pan look and said nothing.   We get back to the room with these chocolates and it was 4 balls the size of marbles with a strawberry cut in half!!!!  I can not believe how bad the service, food and attitude has deteriotated at OLIVES!  I was embarrassed in front of my family after having talked this place up and to have this horrible experience and being treated so horrible at the same time!  I will never go back to Olives and will be sure to tell everyone I know to never go there!!! IT sucks!  The one star is only because it's in the BELLAGIO which we love."
0,"My experience here Dr Hollis Underwood should thank me that I have only written negative complaints to her directly and now in yelp. The experience I had here would be worthy of a complaint to the medical board. \n\nI called to make an appointment to establish myself as a patient the Monday after Labor Day and was in need of an urgent visit as a follow up from an ER visit after a car accident. The first available appointment was December 3rd. \n\nI was forewarned that Dr Underwood doesn't limit her time with her patients to the 15 min insurance companies allow her to bill for and therefore requires her patients pay an additional $150 a year. On the phone I was told I could decide to pay this fee after my initial visit but that wasn't what happened when I got there. \n\nThere was a terrible wait. Then I wS taken back for some preliminary tests and brought back out to wait some more. \n\nI was given really unnecessary tests for someone in their 30s such as a bone density test, EKG and the list goes on. \n\nDr underwood was eager to diagnose me with several severe diseases none of which I even had adequate symptoms to consider an adequate concern she was dying to give me a Pap smear but I had seem my Gyno for my annual well woman exam the day before so that too was unnecessary. \n\nHer staff for the most part were short and abrasive and her scare tactics were disgusting and unappreciated. \n\nMost outrageous was that she ordered tests be sent to me to do at home and send back without ever discussing them with me. Unacceptable!!!\n\nShe doesn't contract with reputable medical facilities like medical imaging and instead has a mobile unit out of another state come to her office monthly. WTF???\n\nWhen I voiced my concerns to her in writing there was not even an attempt to apologize or clear up any confusion. She was simply happy to keep my $150 and who knows what she was collecting from my insurance and let me move on to the next doctor. \n\nI did immediately seek a second opinion and all of her serious concerns were found invalid at Scottsdale Healthcare. \n\nI always enjoyed the prizes in Cracker Jax boxes myself but I prefer my doctors licenses carry more credibility than the cracker Jax prizes.   \n\nRun, don't just walk away from this one and see any other doctor instead."
0,My mother had two procedures done there this morning. Ultrasound and MRI. Staff was really nice but the Issue is that when we get there they spring a $640 co-pay on her. They did not tell her ahead of time so someone who is already under immense stress. This caused her to panic about the procedure. I think that this should be on the check list of the pre-registration.
1,"My favorite place to get sushi in Vegas so far. The staff is great, they always give you a warm welcome and take good care of you. Johnny does a great job of making special rolls for us when we come in. If you can think of a combo, he can think of a way to make it delicious! \n\nWhether you sit at the bar or take a quite table in the dinning room its is always an enjoyable evening. We have been going here for over a year and no disappointments so far."
0,This is always hit and miss. I just went and got the works and added leather treatment. My car was dirtier then when I dropped it off. I was one of two cars and 12 employees. Not pleased.
0,"Where do I even begin to describe the atrocity that is the Hotel De Paris.  I once stayed in a hostel in Cambodia and awoke to a rat gnawing gently at my face, and strangely this experience was not nearly as troubling as my experience at the HDP. \n\nUpon arrival you enter a cheery converted Victorian mansion tastefully done in muted pastels and with plenty of exposed refinished wood to greet you, and for a brief moment you feel that you may have found the best deal in Montreal-but then you are quickly \""relocated\"" to their other heritage building or 'D block\"" as we heard it lovingly referred to by a fellow traveller.\n\nWe were told that there was a \""problem\"" in our booking and that they were unable to accommodate the original terms of the booking, but that they had vacancy in their second heritage building and that essentially we had to accept this or could find other accommodation. Seeing that we were staying on a Saturday during the May long weekend, and had previously scoured the city for other vacancies we were not in a negotiating position.\n\nWe drove the short two minutes to the second building and couldn't find it.  We then saw a small sign indicating that we were in fact smack in front of it, but this couldn't be.  There was trash strewn in all directions at the entrance and the door that was supposed to be locked was flung open haphazardly.  After descending the few steps to our new subterranean chamber  we tentatively entered and were greeted with a pungent mix of body odour, hairspray and urine.  It was also suffocatingly humid and even the walls appeared to be sweating in revulsion.  We slithered our way to dorm \""K\"" where I was astonished to see what appeared to be an old cold storage room stacked with multiple rickety bunk beds.  Now to say that three people would have been comfortable in such a space would be fair, but twelve!  There was absolutely nowhere to store luggage-I ended up sleeping with my backpack and using it as a makeshift pillow, do to the fact that the provided pillow was caked with an indeterminable black dusting.  It was quickly noted that two of the four washrooms on the unit were out of order.  the third would quickly follow.  We calculated that there were approximately three washrooms for upwards of thirty people.  I made several calls to the front desk to alert them to the potential revolt that they would almost certainly have when fellow travellers would be returning from their nights of debauchery in Canada's sin city, yet despite this act of civic duty on my behalf no attempt was made to rectify the situation.  It wasn't until the following mid afternoon as we were preparing to check out that I saw a housekeeper gingerly approach with a mop and plunger in hand.  Evidently she knew what to expect, I certainly wish we did. \n\nNow it is important to stress that I do not have a personal vendetta or any ill will toward the HDP, I simply feel the strong need to make people aware that they should never ever consider staying here.\n\nIt baffles me that such a place continues to operate in a pseudo successful manner.  They must bank on the fact that those spending any time in HDP are so traumatized by their experiences that they vow to never speak of it again and hence don't spread the word that it should be avoided at all costs.  In writing this very lengthy review it was my vow to break this silence, and hope that it may deter others from spending their hard earned dollars here."
1,"If Raku had a location near my house, I would probably go everyday. I'm not kidding--Raku is THAT good. Normally, on trips to Vegas, we usually venture to restaurants on the strip, but after seeing the reviews for this place we knew we had to give it a shot. And boy, am I glad we did!\n\nWe started off with the house special tofu (both cold and hot)---probably the best dish out of all the plates. The texture of the tofu is out of this world--creamy, yet firm with great flavor! If my love for tofu wasn't already beyond the fence, this dish kicked it out of the world! A MUST. \n\nWe also ordered:\nfoie gras- super creamy, melts in your mouth\npork cheek-great smokey flavor\nasparagus- again great flavor\ngrilled duck--slightly gamey and chewy\nchicken breast with crispy skin-SO SO GOOD. not dry at all, full of flavor\n(small bite) chicken and egg-(This is similar to a don bowl, amazing taste and great portion size on top of the tapas)\nkobe steak-it's kobe beef! enough said. \npork ears-crunchy texture and great flavor\n\nOn top of our wonderful dining experience, we also saw Olympian Apollo Anton Ohno sitting behind us!! He was with an Iron Chef contestant and some other people. If Apollo and an Iron Chef contestant eats here, I think you're in good shape to experience a fantastic meal here. \n\nCan't wait to go back!"
0,"I really like a good sandwich. There's just something divine about the combination of good bread, quality meat, fresh toppings, and well-chosen condiments all put together in a user-friendly package. Regrettably, Jimmy John doesn't provide that.\n\nStart with the bread-- plain white bread with zero flavor and no character. No whole wheat option (for at least a dollar more, you can get seven grain bread for some, not all, of the sandwiches), no flatbread or wraps. This is allegedly gourmet?! Then there's the filling. Somewhere buried under the bland bread, mound of industrially shredded lettuce, and pale cardboard-tasteless tomato there's a slice or two of meat that is hard to notice. Condiment choice is narrow, and the application thereof is extremely variably, sometimes drowned in it and sometimes featuring the merest swipe. Hot sandwich choices simply don't exist. You crave a hot roast beef or hot ham with melted gruyere? Too bad. These sandwiches are a step below even national chains like Subway, where they at least provide more choices and flavor profiles, from fillings to condiments to toppings, and yes, hot sandwiches!\n\nI suppose I understand why inexperienced, budget-conscious people would give them a lot of business-- the basic sandwiches are cheap and filling (all that bread and lettuce!), adequate enough for quick thoughtless sustenance. But for a place that labels itself \""gourmet\"" it falls so far short it's laughable.\n\nI grudgingly give Jimmy John's two stars because it's possible to get a decent sandwich from them, by getting something from the \""deluxe\"" side of the menu made with whole-grain bread, or adding extra meat, cheese, and toppings to the basic sandwich choices-- both options that will bring the cost beyond the tolerance of the targeted audience (and still not in the \""gourmet\"" category).\n\nA word about the delivery: They advertise \""freaky fast\"" delivery, which is probably why I see their delivery drivers committing every moving violation you can imagine. Wrong way on a one-way street? No problem. Right on red in a campus district where it's clearly prohibited? You bet! Ignoring pedestrians in crosswalks? Why not?"
0,"So we decided to give the coffee pub a chance based on past reviews, hoping to maybe find ourselves a new breakfast spot.\n\nUnfortunately we were pretty disappointed.  The White mocha was a mish-mash of unbearably sweet and bitterly burnt espresso/milk.\n\nThe pancakes were bland and ..... tough?!?!?!  it takes some special skill to make pancakes TOUGH and leathery\n\nThe country potatoes were.... a confusing mix of underdone and overdone.\n\nand in Eimi's words, the ribeye  - \""Tastes like the reason why I didn't like meat growing up\""\n\nPrices were above-average for what they serve\n\nThe only saving grace that kept this restaurant away from a one-star review was the friendly waitress.\n\nI was hoping for so much better than below-mediocre.  The search for a breakfast spot continues."
0,"Still no communication from TOCA, they obviously do not care about their customers. Oh that's right, we are not customers, we are patients. I was corrected by their staff. Thanks for pointing that out!"
0,"Was in one night for a show next door, but decided to go cheap.  Cheep it was!  All show and no go.  It's a beautiful hotel from the outside, but I think It is just old now, and service didn't help.   We were getting a \""non smoking\"" room, but we got to the room and it was really stinky and smokey.  I called and they said just come down to the \""manager's desk\"" and they will get us a new room, so we hiked down and not one person was willing to help us.  When we finally got to someone, she rudely said go to the desk at the very end.  We did, and no one was there.  Waited 10 minuted before going to here again, and she was just annoyed at this point with me.  She told me to wait there and someone would help me.  So I did, and about  10 minutes later, someone stumbled down to us and told us to go the the OTHER SIDE!  If you have been here, it is a long desk!  Especially when you have 2 full bottles in your bag, ha ha.  \nOverall, just a bad customer service experience, maybe if we were there 1 hour prior, it would've just been an old hotel and not so horrible.  Would I stay again?  Only if I HAD to save money and the show was next door.  Other than that, yeah no."
1,"I am in freddys all the time, but today felt different.  Everyone Seemed on edge and stressed out.  It had me really concerned.  But when i got to the cash register, James was there with his normal smile and a good attitude.  He looked a little frazzled, but went out of his way to ask how my day was.  He asked if I needed help.  He made me feel important.  Employees like that are why I keep coming back"
0,"Nice sports bar away from the regular highway fare and that makes it attractive to local folks.  However I have to say that the amount of smoking that goes on is like you are down wind of a pine tree forest fire.  When will this state final give in?  The food is good.  I have had the pulled pork platter.  The sweet potato fries are good, they are also rolled in brown sugar.  TV's could be upgraded to flat screens and the carpet is in desperate need of replacing.  The ATM machine looks like it would steal your pin number.  The non-smokes section is like being in an isolalation ward.  I give the restrooms a 2.5out of 5 stars.  Looks like there could be a lot of coke snorting going on.  For all that is wrong what you get in return is low prices.  Much cheaper than the Hickory Tavern located right off the highway.  You can also play a great game of pool (3 tables if I remember correctly), video golf and video bowling.  Decent service, lots of seating but it was pretty fully with an hour wait on a Tuesday.  So if you get there before 7pm you can find some open areas to sit.  Also, they have a decent amount of high tables and chairs in the game area."

1,"I recently visited EnteBella for a custom facial. I had never been there before but I was recommended to them by a friend who has raved about how amazing they are. I arrived a little early to fill out some paperwork (it's a few pages of skin/health related questions so give yourself a little time before your appointment to fill everything out). The staff is super friendly and their waiting room area is beautiful and so relaxing. I love the decor. The wall with water/bubbles running down is so pretty and instantly relaxing!\n\nAshley brought me back to a room and then let me change into a soft robe and lay down under the covers of a comfy bed. The blankets are heated and it's so comfortable. She came back in and started the facial. She went through a series of different cleansers, exfoliators, and then moisturizer. I didn't want it to end! I felt so relaxed and my skin felt AMAZING afterward. It did not make my skin break out at all and just left my face feeling so smooth. Ashley is so sweet and talented and I can't wait to come back and see her again!\n\nI know they do many other treatments and I plan to be back very soon. Laser hair removal is next on my list and I can't wait to get it started. \n\nI would absolutely recommend EnteBella!!"

0,"In the day, before I had any incline of indie coffee chains(pre Yelp) and when my favourite place to chill out after work was Waterstones, the coffee supplied by its previous occupiers, was more than just well coffee...I mostly went there for the banter, from the baristas.\n\nSo tell me Edinburgh what's happened to this bookywooky shop? Really do nice cakes make up for the gapping chasm of friendliness and passion that used to lure me back week upon week; I think not! Somehow it has left me less warm to the chain since the renovation, just like a random wifi connection.\n\nYep the black/cream walls could do with a good lick of paint, the toilets could be more welcoming, the dwindling book stock could be more...stocky! New coffee team, different position of the coffee shop(why change it if it ain't broken) this place is in real danger of of going either one of two ways. Either turning into an abode that resembles Black Books or a massive Kindle shop? I know which one  I'd prefer?\n\nGod help me if one day I go in and Bernard Manny and Fran are sitting drinking red wine in the corner, swatting strange unseen creatures, while they discuss the reasons not to throw a kindle in the bin, or end the suffering of book lovers and give this place back the dignity and charm it deserves or put it out to pastures new.\n\nI did like coming here, but now as I know it's lost a few regular customers, dropped a few more books since I started writing this email and not really made many inspirational changes to keep me from going elsewhere then apologies to them.\n\nBut if your gonna subtract something then if you add something else you really should multiply to get better results. With great power comes greater responsibility so please Waterstones be even greater and more responsible!"
0,"Dog Park Review only--\nPeople smoke and throw their butts there.\nNumerous people don't pick up after their dogs.\nThe \""grass\"" is pretty much dead.\nNumerous people mix the small and large dogs together which causes trouble.\nI have seen young kids playing there and end up getting jumped on or knocked down.\nI only go there because it's close to the house. I am going to look for nicer dog parks that are worth the drive."
0,"This show had to be the worst show I have ever seen in Vegas, and I've seen some bad ones.  The comedy in the act was semi-funny, but not enough to make this seem worth the money for the ticket.  The girls?  Sure they looked good.  But the dancing and the girls didn't seem worth the price of a ticket.   The singer?  I think I've seen better lounge act singers.  No, no, in fact, I am SURE I have seen better lounge act singers.  I donno, maybe I just wasn't in the mood for what this show had to offer, which from what I recall wasn't really much of anything.  I would have had more entertainment at a strip joint.\n\nOh the worst part is that the show started like an hour late because Carrothead went overtime.  I was already in a bad mood.  In fact, just thinking about this is pissing me off.  End."
1,"We went there before going to our show. The ambiance was cozy and our server was really nice. \nWe had our food served to us really fast, it was delicious. \nThe wine served was perfect to the table and reasonably priced. Their dessert: ice-cream covered with an expresso was soooo good! I still can taste it :D"
0,"Skewed News Hour\nWas not funny.  It was supposed to be improv,  The sketches were rehearsed and nothing to do with the \""new articles\"" the audience posted.  A waste of my time."
0,"Disappointing.  Too many selections that don\""t belong in a Chinese Buffet.  Food is barely passable and is poorly seasoned.  Too bad."
0,"I feel bad for giving this one star, as MOST of the servers and bartenders were excellent. \n\nHowever, tonight.... we were there after my best friend's wedding, which was at the resort (which I will also write a review for, and will be MUCH better than this review). We arrived there at midnight, having been told by the wedding coordinator that they will stay open until two. We sat down at the large fire pit. Not two seconds after we sat down, I guess some sort of incident/ bar fight happened. Not at all the fault of the bar, I get that and I'm not blaming anyone for that. \n\nWhat I DID NOT appreciate was the aftermath and how the situation was handled. First off, a server named Kay came over and RUDELY said \""I'm turning this off\"" (fire pit) and said the bar's closed, you have to leave. The bride explained we had been told the bar was open until 2. Kay responded \""Honey, I don't make the hours.\"" Maybe Kay was having a bad day, maybe Kay was told by a manager that we couldn't be there.... I don't care. But don't speak that way to a bride at your resort!!\n\nNEXT... we sat there for another couple of minutes because we weren't aware of the incidient/bar fight occuring feet away from us and because we figured we would um... FINISH OUR DRINKS and then leave. Some security guard walks over, looks straight at the bride, and says \""You were asked to leave and you have to go now\""\n\nMy best friend left IN TEARS. IN TEARS!!! She ended her wedding night crying because she was yelled at by staff members of this resort, and felt she had been lied to since she was told the bar closed at 2. Her sister, a close family friend, and myself stayed behind to speak to a manager about the way she was treated. \n\nThis is when we spoke to Krysta. Might have got the spelling wrong on her name.... but really who cares if I spell her name wrong... she was SO DISREPECTFUL of the bride's sister and our family friend who was being very respectful and explaining that we simply wanted something done. I just wanted a freaking apology! She got someone else to come over, Cheri. Cheri was nice and helped us out. It DID take her an hour.. which to me was a wasted hour that she or Krysta could have already gone out and apologized to the bride. When I pointed this out to Krysta, her response was \""well an apology isn't going to do any good at this point\""\n\nUM... YES IT IS! It will show that you actually care that a BRIDE at your resort had a bad experience. Krysta tried using so many excuses and was so rude to us every step of the way. \n\nI worked in customer service for 12 years and I understand when things are out of your control. I understand snapping at people.... and for that reason I don't really blame Kay for responding the way she did. And I appreciate Cheri trying to help. But Krysta... there is no excuse for her. She's supposed to be a manager. Managers have calm and courteous demeanors... NOTHING like hers. \n\nI am just so appalled at how the whole situation was handled, Cheri made it right at the end but it never should have gotten to the point that it did. It was not our fault an incident happened with another party and it was certainly not our responsiblity to read minds and know exactly what was happening and know that we were somewhere we weren't supposed to be. A much simpler way tto approach it, for both the security guard and Kay, would have been to say \""I'm sorry ladies but we have an incident going on so we are going to have to have you leave this area.\"" Doesn't take a genius to figure that out!"
1,"This is one of my new favorite restaurants!  A friend and I had what equates to a vegetarian lasagna (I forget the name)...YUM!  And the mushroom risotto...YUM!  I had a nearly perfect martini, made just for me, with extra olives on the side just 'cause they love me (or so I would like to think)!  In other words, great service!  And it is a hop, skip, and a jump from home.  How could it be any better?  Seriously, I hardly ever choose Italian when I am eating out, but this place will make me rethink my choices every time!"
0,"horrific food. lousy service. my eggplant was inedible. i tried to send it back. my husband had sausage and polenta. the sausage was hard and burnt, over garliced and over spiced. it tasted like charcoal. the polenta was flavorless and soggy and didn't even resemble corn meal. tasted like it was made from ground cardboard. house red was lousy."
1,"Nice views but not the best. Drinks were pricey but excellently made by warm and very friendly servers.\n\nGreat vibe, good tunes at right volume, and very comfortable seats.\n\nThe nut tray is a plus.\n\nIf i were staying at City Center or Cosmo, id return."
1,I came here on a Sunday afternoon when the dining room was closed but they were cooking orders for pickup. I had a really nice chat with Joel while I waited for my pizza and gnocchi. Nice people run this place and the food is delicious. I've been here several times between 2012 and 2014 and have had consistently good food and good service. It feels good to support local business and be enthusiastic about it. This place has always been great and continues to be.
1,"Andrew and Bo were on time, hard workers, careful, and genuinely nice guys. I knew prior to calling them that there was a charge for stairs, but even with the fee their flat rates were lower than other movers I found. \n\nThey showed up exactly on time, and quickly unloaded my two packed uboxes quickly and carefully in less than an hour and a half. I'll definitely be contacting them again as soon as my fiance moves into town in a couple months.\n\nNote to all people looking for movers--don't forget to tip!"
0,"We went last night (Wednesday) for our anniversary.  We were planning on Brio, but after reading reviews, thought why not try something different, it's close by.\n\nThe atmosphere was nice.\n\nThe presentation of all the food was nice.\n\nWe had a cocktail while we were looking over the menu, and they were very tasty, and seemed to be stronger than most restaurants server, which we liked.\n\nThe service was good.  They had maybe three or four other tables seated, and a lot of staff on hand.\n\nNow why a rating of 2?\nWe were not impressed at all with the food.  The pasta my wife ordered was supposed to have rib-eye beef tips.  The two I saw looked like the tips of fat and gristle that you'd cut off a ribeye while you eat the rest.  The pasta was ok and had good flavor, but not too hard to mess up pasta.\n\nI had the sea bass.  I nice little four ounce portion, with bones through half of it.  I mentioned it to the waiter who explained that to find a bone is very rare and lucky.  Well, it was kind of annoying I thought to have to chew it up into baby food consistency, and then wait until my wife turned her head so I could get the bones out of my mouth and hide them, so as not to ruin the dinner.\n\nDon't know if I'm right or wrong, but knowing it's more on the expensive end, I don't mind paying 25 for a piece of fish or some pasta, but it had better blow me away, instead of wishing I'd gone somewhere else.\n\nThe complimentary bean dip was ok.  I'm not an afficionado of it or anything, but I could take it or leave it.\n\nThe creme brulee was good."
0,"I've been coming to Organ Stop Pizza since I was a kid with my family. The organ music and atmosphere are unique and enjoyable, and I love coming now for those reasons...but the food....not so great. The pizza isn't anything special, not much better than a $5 frozen pizza, and the salad bar is lacking. If they stepped it up on the quality of the food I would probably eat here more often. 2 stars for the awesome entertainment."
1,Awesome place to race Go Karts! It's outside and right by the strip. The track is awesome and the karts are pretty fast. It's best to go later in the afternoon since it's pretty hot during the day. They also give you really cold water
0,"Nothing stood out about the place. I had lunch here with a friend that is a fan of the place. The lunch came and it was just fine. Besides being quiet and appearing clean the place looked more Japanese than Chinese to me. And the waitperson, well she was icy and abrupt. \nI'm just not feeling that it's a place I will be wanting to revisit anytime soon."
1,"Short Leash, hmmm, what can i say. If you love dogs, hot dogs and food in general, this place is the only way to go. Look them up on facebook, get heir calendar and follow them around. My wife and I love them, great food, awesome people, what else can you ask for. Price is awesome, but quality is waaaaay better. Get an awesome meal at SIT-STAY and end the week in good company. Enjoy and stay safe"
0,I've been going to this Restaurant every Saturday for months! It became almost like a family tradition! The main reason my group  went is because of the superb service we would get from JUSTIN! We were at a loss for words to hear that he was no longer there! Justin is such an asset and will truly be missed by many!! What a loss!!!
0,The food is always good but the service has been very poor every time I go. We started getting carry out over dining it because of how poor the service is.
1,"Just got back from breakfast and was there last night for dinner.  Both were exceptional meals.  For us it was \""as good as it gets.\""  Some highlights from dinner - you've got to try the roasted beets - really unique & delicious.  The naan was all the more tasty having seen it made in the open kitchen.  The whitefish was succulent & juicy and VERY fresh and the pork chop was a generous 12 oz portion perfectly prepared. Our breakfast today was also a delight - called the \""lifestyle breakfast entree\"" - the egg white omelet was heavenly but the side of cherry tomatoes roasted with garlic and onions was the best side in the morning.  So overall I would say this is a winner.  Locally sourced products, imaginative menu, beautiful venue, and pleasant service makes this worth a visit."
0,"Very average. Sushi rolls are overpriced for the amount of food you get. The food itself was decent to good. I had the seven flavor beef, which was above average. A lot of the menu items are spicy. Lettuce wraps were good. \n\nTwo pet peeves - first, they poured red wine into my white wine glass. Second, the menus were laminated and glossy, which made them difficult to read. \n\nContrary to what some others have written, the decor was not anything special.  Lighting was also a little bright I think and tables too close together."
1,"Have gotten take-out from here twice.  First time wife brought home wings and fries and I liked them very much.  \n\nI logged onto yelp today to locate a wing place and was dismayed to read all the negative reviews.  They're the closest wing place to my house and I did like the food last time so I decided to give them another shot.\n\nCalled in my order and the lady who answered the phone was very nice, and even suggested one of their specials to save me some money when she heard what I wanted.\n\nArrived 15 mins later to pick up my food.  Two people working, both adults.  The nice lady greeted me with a smile and took my money.  I looked into the kitchen and a gentleman was finishing packaging my food.  I heard him say to the lady 'I wasn't sure what to do with the fries' so I am guessing he is new.  \n\nThe service was fine despite all the previous reviews, and I suspect it's because there are new adult personnel working the restaurant.\n\nBrought my food home and was very pleased with the quality.  The wings were perfectly cooked and the Buffalo Hot Sauce was tasty (though not notably hot/spicy).  The fries were excellent, some of the best I've had from a quick-stop place.  I saw a huge bag of potatoes in the kitchen so they obviously cut them fresh.  The season them with something so delicious I ate them with no ketchup; they're that good.  The blue cheese dressing is homemade and mine was flavored with a LOT of garlic; never had blue cheese dressing taste like that but it was quite good and I did use some of it on the occasional french fry.\n\nI will definitely return.  Hopefully the owner/manager has gotten his staff straightened out and the food and service stay as good as I experienced today."
1,I wanted some good Mexican so I decided to register on Yelp and look up what was available.  My first experience with Yelp and with Juan's.  The Yelp reviews were spot on and so was the food.  I will definitely go back.  The staff was very friendly and attentive.  The pork fajita was excellent.  Very tender chucks of pork that fell about in your mouth.  Wonderful.  I also drink a lot of soda when I eat.  I hate places that don't keep you in drinks.  This place got an A+.  I always had a least a half full glass of soda!
1,"There is a LONG wait here, so if your are in a hurry or starving go somewhere else. I ordered the cobb salad that was HUGE and wonderful! The applewood smoked bacon made it....huge hunks of eggs and avocados. It's a cute little place, but be patient and don't be a clean freak....I ordered coffee and water & could see \""stuff\"" like lip marks on both...it was interesting!"
1,"They advertise a $15.95 oil change, 32 point inspection and tire rotation on their sign, so when my partner was out of town, I took her Pontiac Vibe in for a little love.\n\nEven though I was a walk in, they still got it taken care of in about half an hour. They were efficient, friendly, did a good job with the car, and I'd definitely go back. With disposal fees and tax, it came to a little over $20, but for all that I got, you just can't beat the price.\n\nHowever, the waiting area could use some love. Luckily, I live nearby, and just walked home to wait."
1,"Rio Tan is the only place I go to if I need to catch some quick rays. I don't use tanining beds too often, but when I do I come here.\n\nThey have pretty good beds and they seem to keep the bulbs changed properly. Whenever I go there the beds are always blazing hot, so I would guess that means the bulbs are good. I am not an expert on tanning beds, but I get dark. That is good enough for me.\n\nYou have a choice of a few different types of beds when you tan here. Like I said, I am not an expert on tanning beds so I just go in the stand up that is supposed to have the high powered bulbs. 2 minutes is the maximum amount of time for the stand up tanner I use, which is plenty. Sometimes I just go for six minutes and that is plenty of time to get me dark.\n\nThis place is expensive, but that does not matter to me. I only go there maybe twice a month at the most and I don't use up my minutes that fast. Plus the place is clean!!\n\nI don't actually recommend tanning to anyone because I do not think it is healthy for your skin, but if you are going to use tanning beds check this place out."
0,"If you are an adrenaline junkie, don't waste your $100... pretty boring. Spend an extra $75 bucks and go skydiving. Skyjump is boring."
0,"We came here on recommendation from a friend who finds it hard to find decent Mexican food in Vegas. \n\nThe good? They have pretty good service, decent guacamole, and my friend's scallops were great, just doused in sauce. Oh, and she ordered a blood orange margarita that was delicious!\n\nThe rest of our meal? Salsas are quite bland, the steak nachos were covered in some orange sauce that made my stomach do somersaults almost immediately...Strangely enough, the carne asada on our nachos was better then the carne asada plate we ordered. Also, I specifically asked what veggies came with the meal because they said we could substitute. The waitress told me squash and zucchini. Perfect! My friend and I both ordered the veggies. When our meals were served, she got the veggies and the ones on my plate were tomatoes and cucumber--more like a tiny Greek salad. I was highly annoyed. For dessert, I just ordered my toddler berries with whipped cream. The berries came in a bowl of a side dish--maybe a dozen total. The whipped cream was a side of creme fraiche. For a toddler. Really? She's two. \""Me no like it\"" is what kept coming out of her mouth. \n\nLastly, the pricing. I paid $138 for two appetizers, two main courses, a tiny bowl of fruit, one alcoholic drink and two sodas--and only ate about 65% of the meal. Huge disappointment. What I'm more confused about is the pricing of the items. I understand it's Vegas and you pay for location. Seriously. I get it. But since when do scallops and shrimp have the same price as a quesadilla or enchiladas?? I'll admit, the quesadilla looked appetizing, but my soul wouldn't let me order it. Quesadillas are what we eat when we need to throw something together quick!\n\nI would not eat here again. I would rather spend more money and indulge my taste buds. I think most of us don't enjoy their meal when it's overpriced and below satisfactory. My bf barely finished the meal and in the words of our daughter said, \""me no like it.\"""
1,Great experience. Will rent any time great employee  Amanda has a great sense of humor
1,"I grew up in South Jersey, and water ice is a summer tradition there.  Rita's has always been a favorite, because of the real fruit inside.  So I was very excited when I found out Rita's was opening in Henderson.\n\nIrving, the owner, could not have been more helpful.  I planned on getting a cherry, because that was always my favorite growing up.  But Irving gave us samples of 4 or 5 different flavors, and encouraged us to take our time to figure out what we wanted.  \n\nIn the end, I wound up with a pint of lemonade and a pint of black cherry.  I was taking them to a friend's house, so Irving made sure to pack the cups for me and gave me some tips on serving them later.  He also gave me his card, and told me to let him know if I wanted to request certain flavors on another day. \n\nI was already going to be a regular customer, because I love Italian Ice.  But that extra customer service was much appreciated.  I'll definitely be going back to Rita's.  Now if only we can get another location on the west side of the valley..."
0,"I came here on a Monday so I missed the seafood buffet.\n\nIncluded beer is cheap, but I like PBR.  I will probably eat here again to try the Seafood Buffet only on a Sunday while somebody is trying to squeeze in that last bit of gambling before driving home."
0,"It was a beautiful summer day and my fiancee and I wanted to sit on the patio for a meal. So we stood waiting to be seated at the entrance, but none of the servers seemed to be too concerned about us or the people waiting behind us. Finally we asked a server passing by to seat us.\n\nWe then ordered a couple of drinks and a Canadian poutine. For some reason, such a simple order took more than half an hour to arrive, while the people behind us with large groups and large meals were served before us. Our waitress made rare appearances. The poutine finally arrived and although it tasted fine, it was nothing special and wasn't filling at all, especially for the premium price of $7.\n\nDon't waste your time at this tourist trap. There are plenty of similar restaurants around, many which are nicer. The menu is very limited and the service wasn't very good at all. Explore the alleyways and surrounding area, you will find much better."
0,"I saw photos from here on Instagram and FB, i was super excited to try their food. So one Saturday i decided to travel uptown to try it out, looked so cute and amazing from the outside, the tacky \""asian\"" decor didn't turn me off one bit, neither did the upscale price tag for the food, but (there is always a but) the weird insanely tangy sauces and broth for the \""soups\"" did.. i am not sure what the chefs were thinking, but these are not flavors meant for these dishes, at all.. \n\ni like \""fusion\"" food as much as the next guy but the lamb pastrami bun tasted as they just saw one in a magazine and tried to match it without reading the ingredients.\n\nkimchi fried rice, it was more of typical Chinese fried with clear kimchi thrown on top of it, which is \""technically\"" kimchi fried rice, but not what it is supposed to be.  There was a sour element to it that is not found in Korean cuisine, that could just be due to the fusion.  \n\nup next we have the \""ramen\"" .. uhm, if all you have had is Top Ramen, you may find this blend delightful or just amazingly odd, as for me, i enjoy my Japanese food, so this tangy mess was definitely a let down as well.\n\nanother one of us ordered some katsu thing, but that is not even worth describing, unless you have a sweet tooth.\n\nthe duck steamed bun was the only savior of the bunch, my only gripe was the bao was much too dense, and i ended up leaving half it on my plate, when usually that is the best part. \n\nIf the pricing wasn't so pretentious, i would have thought about giving this two stars."
0,"I really wanted to like this place - I truly did, but alas it was not to be.  I'm not a beer lover - but for those that are - they have about a billion beers to choose from.  I did get some delish hard cider.  They also have unusual bottled sodas which are fun to try.  The bartender/waiter was extra nice - good service and someone you could tell cared about his job.  That was the good... unfortunately - that doesn't include any of the food.  The pretzel with cheese was just ok - didn't taste fresh and soft and the cheese sauce was very heavy on the swiss flavor and kind of bland.  We were excited to try the poutine - and VERY disappointed.  The gravy was bland and you could still taste the flour.  It was basically just a $10+ plate of trash.  Hubby had a brat - which he wasn't really impressed with.  I got the Pig Mac - I did like it but not enough to be able to convince hubs to return.  The inside seating is all high tops - and not particularly comfy.  \n\nBottom line - this isn't a place for us - it's a place for people who love beer and horseshoes and don't mind sitting on uncomfy bar stools.  People for whom the food might be a second thought and maybe have beer goggles on while they are eating."
0,"I don't get it. \nEveryone from the west coast is always raving about the burgers at this place. Why?? We came by here last night...had the animal fries and the double-double and the flavor was blah. Fries were cold...sauce was eh. The burger itself just had nothing memorable about it. At all. Except for the fact that it made me sick. I've been up all night with horrific gas pains. I will NOT be coming back here. Maybe it's just this location. If I'm ever in Cali, I'll take a bite out of someone else's burger before I decide it's worth it to order my own."
1,Tr\u00e8s bons sushis & bonne ambiance japonaise!
0,We were very disappointed in this restaurant as the other reviews and photos looked so good!  We went for breakfast and the portions were small and lacked flavor.  We will not go back.  We should have stuck with the hotel's buffet.
1,"Ok it looks like my yekp specialty is reviewing restaurants in airports. What i like about this place is its non chain feel, and the fact that while you're there you forget, maybe for just a few moments, that your in an airport terminal. solid bar food, I've had the buffalo tenders and the burger. I think they measure their shots (makes fof weak drinks), so stick to beer."
1,"Adrenaline junkies unite!\n\nSimilar to Supreme Scream @ Knotts in Brea, but WAY better since you're higher by about 10x more. \n\nOnly bad part I have to say about this ride, is being the clumsy me I smacked my head against the harness RIGHT before I got on. \n\nBut very fun and a must try."
0,I went here yesterday. I was seated quickly wait staff was excellent. But the sushi was over priced and not very good. I had the monkey roll and the salmon lover no rice they were 12.00 each not impressed I won't be going back
1,"I had my first cleaning yesterday. Carolyn and Denise were courteous, professional and on time. They did an awesome job!! My house looks and smells fantastic!! Check Maids gets an A+ in my book!!"
1,"My wife and I stayed here for a week last year, and we welcomed the opportunity to come back.  The room is basically a large studio with a large bath.  There are louvered French doors in between the bedroom and the living room, and I just have to be very quiet when I waken since I usually wake up earlier than my wife.  But we love the comfortable set up.  The shower stall is huge and there is a large Jacuzzi tub which neither of us have yet to use (we do have one at home, after all,) and double sinks and lots of cabinet space in the bathroom.  We always get a king bed, and there is not much storage in the bedroom but plenty in the bathroom.  Full refrigerator, no dishwasher or washer/dryer, but we knew that, and there is a toaster and coffreemaker and mcrowave.   DVD player, Videotape player and flat screen TV in the living room, and many recent DVD movies for free at the front desk.  There is an additional smaller flat screen TV on the bedroom wall.  Only tihng a litte different here is the parking--you may not park close to your unit, but the front desk is always happy to give you a ride on golf carts whenever you ask.  The friendly bellmen take your luggage in for you as you unpack and pack your car.  This is a full golf resort, so all of the units look out over the golf course with beautiful picture windows.  There is a huge pool and sun deck and spa, very nice and comfortable for many people.  Only other negative is their effort to sell you a time share--we're getting a little fed up with that when we get trades or getaways via Interval International, and we do not like being harrassed to do that when we make it clear at check in that we are not interested.  In spite of that, we will probably be back a third time, or every year as long as it is available.  We love Scottsdale and this is the second year in a row we have driven 2000 miles one-way to enjoy two weeks in the beautiful desert!"
0,"The food was ok. The crowd was really loud and the whole experience (you have to wait in a crowded room for 15 min before you can sit, we paid for a bottle of wine and only get 2 glasses) was disappointing. The best part was the grilled portobellos, but I can do them way better on my own BBQ. And it's really not cheap for what it is.\n\nGood idea, weak execution."
0,Wow every time I come here there out of like 3 items always waiting.  And I come here at 1215 1230 prime lunch time.  Ans I don't have lots of time to wait around.    Chow mien out     Orange chicken out.  Really. Wow     But food is good.    But  prepare to wait
0,"DIDN'T EAT HERE...this review not about the food.  We went on Friday night around 8pm, there seemed to be about 25% occupancy.  The hostess asked us if we had a reservation, we didn't , and she told us that they were somewhat behind and that we would have to wait 20-30 minutes.  WTF?  We IMMEDIATELY left and frankly its not worth going back again.  shame, the fish was good there. Crappy hostess for sure."
0,"Alright, so a few disclaimers before I begin: I was with a big group, so give the server a little grace- and I don't like paying $20/dish to begin with. Now that that's out of the way...\nI ordered a lobster and shrimp pasta dish but I'm not exactly sure which one. It literally had four tiny shrimp and one small piece of lobster. On top of that, I had asked for no mushrooms and they were there in excess. I know, I should have sent it back and not wait til now to complain about it, but shortly after we got our foor our server(s) came around with a block of parmesean to sprinkle on the food of those who wanted it. My friend and I flagged one down and she said she \""didn't want to walk around the table\"" to put it on ours, so she grabbed an empty bread plate and scraped a mound onto it and handed it to me; I decided not to ask her for anything else.\nIn summation, Brio is just overpriced for what you get- service and all."
1,"I read on here before I booked at Aria and I was excited to check this place out.\n\nCheck in a breeze. Check out even more breezy.\n\nThe game floor is really clean, new and doesn't have a smoke smell to it.  restaurants  were of a nice decor and we checked out Sage and it was Epic. Really well put together meal. \n\nConcierge was friendly. Printed out our cirque tickets at MGM Grand, and pointed us on our way. \nLocation is really good. Walkway to Monte carlo which has a fast food court and cheap tables. Connects to the Vdara and Bellagio via tram but walking for us was way faster. and right outside Aria is a CVS store for cheap booze. \nNow to the rooms. I gave in to the Aria due to the fact it was suppose to be super hi tech. Everything can be controlled by the remote, but I was expecting more. The bed was extremely comfy but the pillows were horrid. 3 pillows evened out to one for me. The air conditioner said it was set for 61 degrees which is the lowest it went and it never reached that temperature. Stuck around 65/67 the whole time. Really strange. and lastly the toilet. Didn't think to flush first before I used it for the first time, and of course it didn't work at all. So that kind of sucked. Simple call to front desk fixed the problem. Reviews on here said they experienced the same problem; so words of advice, flush first, then try.\n\nAria is a fun place to stay in Vegas if you want something a little more relaxing and a little less Vegas Vibe."
0,Found  hair in my food.  BLECH!!  Never ever again!
1,"I've never been here for breakfast, so I can't speak to the many negative comments about that. However, their lunch is fantastic! I've eaten there several times, and I've never been disappointed. My last meal there was basically a salade nicoise but with salmon rather than tuna. The haricots verts were snappy, the dressing was excellent, and the fish was perfectly cooked. Yes, the space is a little cramped, but this doesn't matter since the service is fast. If it's too crowded for you you can get in and get out quickly."
1,"After having some issues with my normal salon I decided it was time to start my search for a new one. I choose 3D Nails based solely on it's location. \n\nArrived about 1:00 on a Saturday afternoon to find the place sold out. I was told it would probably be about 15 minutes so I opted to wait. It's very small with 4 techs working. While waiting I browsed the polish selection, which is extensive, they even have the new magnetic polishs and a large selection of gel polishes. After about 5 minutes they had a pedicure chair open so I started my soak. And I soaked, and soaked. Finally 20 minutes or so later my tech started my classic pedi.\n\nShe filed them just as I like square. I have had issues with several places not knowing what square means. Even though they were very busy I didn't feel she rushed and actually did a really good job for $18. I loved the fact that their basic pedicure comes with a sugar scrub. My normal place of 2 years charged extra for it. Not here it's included. \n\nAfter polishing she asked if I wanted a flower and I said \""no\"" but could she do zebra stripes on just my big toes. She didn't understand and had to ask another tech. I didn't really get what I had in mind but it has started to grow on me and I love the colors.\n\n3D Nails might just be my new go to nail salon. Next time I will upgrade to the deluxe pedicure. If the cheap $18 one includes the sugar scrub I am curious what the $25 one includes. Based on my 1 experience I would recommend 3D Nails."
1,"Fantastic service! Everyone there was laughing and having a great time. Christy was my nail technician and she was great! She took her time with everything, made great conversation, and helped me make the difficult choices of nail color and pattern. I got both a pedi and mani and they were fantastic! The other nail place I used to go to messed up my my nails so many times, but this place is right on the dot, \n\nGreat options at affordable prices. Only $75 for gel mani and deluxe pedi. Definitely recommend."
1,great BBQ great service my fav is tri tip sandwich ribs also great and love the sauces!!!
0,"I have been going to North for 10 years. It once was a cool,layed back place with great service and food. The bartenders knew their regulars and there were a lot. Sorry Sam Fox. No longer true. It is so hot in there and the service is awful.. I asked if I could sample 2 wines. I was given a dime size of wine each time. I settled on Conte Fini Pino Grigio. A safe no brainer. Bartender opened the bottle then sat it down at the bar gave us 2 empty glasses, then left. She didn't even pour 1 glass. And the wine was warm. The pizza of the day was cheese and sausage. I asked if I could get it with out sausage but with a little basil on top. No I was told. It would cost a dollar. Ok I said. The pizza was like cardboard with crust. It used to be great. What happened? It was crowded so I guess they don't care."
1,"I freaking love Sprouts. The produce is here is so obnoxiously cheap and fresh. And with the boy being an herbivore and all, it helps keep the bills down. Seriously though, 3 bulbs of garlic for 98 cents, 3 red bell peppers for $1, 4 for $5 strawberries....fantastic. \n\nI love the selection of organic brands they have as well, many of which are usually on some good sales. I also love that you're able to scoop your own rices, beans, trail mixes, candy, etc. Along with the spices. They also have a huge stock of organic cosmetic/hygiene products. \n\nLike Trader Joe's though, you're not guaranteed to find everything you need/want here. We usually do two lists, the Sprouts list, and the Safeway list - for eggs, the occasional Ben & Jerry's, string cheese, deli meats, etc."
1,"I'm a fan of Arby's because I enjoy their Reuben Sandwich and their Turkey Sandwich. It's a chill place with just the right A/C setting. I usually catch up on my reading during lunch so this place ticks all the right boxes in that regard.\n\nMy major gripe about this Arby's is in their haste to always upsell you they charge you more than what you order. I upgrade my drink size but it doesn't mean I want their gigantic curly fries. I finally had to read the riot act today and spell it out for them. Many years ago you would get a print out receipt of every item you ordered. These days you get the total you were charged on your credit card but you don't have any idea if you were charged correctly on each item.\n\nSo even though I still like you Arby's, I'm not ringing that bell."
1,"My daughter and I stopped In for a late night snack. We decided to come here after seeing numerous IG posts from my friend Nelson Q  :)  Items tried:  Avocado Slush with Boba, Watermelon Milk Tea with Boba and an order of Potstickers.  All were yummy, although the potsticker sauce was a bit on the oily side (despite mixing prior to dipping).  Service was quick and staff were friendly. Parking was a little difficult since this strip mall Is so busy but luckily we were able to find a spot on the opposite end ."
1,"Love, love, love this place. Weekend specials are always delish, especially the saltimbocca. Best tiramisu I've ever had, hands down."
1,"Experience:  last year I came here with my 95 y/o Grandfather for Christmas dinner, so we decided to come back kinda like a tradition this year. We came here once in between too.  It has been kind of hit and miss since the first time.  \nThe first time was 5 star.  The next time it was 2.5 star. This time was 3.5.\n\nFood: I ordered the scallop appetizer, but had to send it back because there was too much sand I was crunching. I don't mind a little sand, but not in every bite. \nThey replaced it with a chef's special, chili shrimp wrapped in bacon. The sauce was good, but the bacon was overdone. \nThen I ordered the ribeye. It's a huge portion, but it's my favorite cut, so I always take some home. Last time they overcooked it...this time it was done almost right.  A little under, but I prefer under any day to over. \nWe shared some lobster mac and cheese, which was delicious. \nMy Grandfather got the rice pudding for dessert. I took a bite and it was very tasty.  Warm pudding with a slight cinnamon flavor topped with whipped cream and raisins. \nI ordered some cheesecake togo for my Christmas treat.  :)\n\nService:  the waiter wasn't very friendly, but maybe that's his nature. The first two times, we had the same waiter and he was amazing!!!!   He was not working tonight. \n\nFacility: very upscale atmosphere with a low lighting. Very comfortable booths and tables and chairs. \n\nOverall:  the food is very good most of the time. When they get it right, it's amazing. Just have not been able to recreate that amazing. We'll probably be back next year."
0,"I really utterly do not understand how this restaurant has such high reviews......we came here on a whim because we had a show to catch (the chippendales heheheh) and we didnt' want buffet. The place was empty when we came in, but there were plenty of servers. My gf and I split the shumai appetizer and a garlic scallion chicken. the other two girls in our group ordered a beef pan fried noodle and the other ordered a seafood pan fried noodle. This is how the convo went down:\n\nGirl #1: \""Hi, I'd like to have the beef pan fried noodle\""\nWaiter: \""Ok\""\nGirl #2: \""Hi, I'd like to have the seafood pan fried noodles\""\nwaiter: \""Beef pan fried noodle?\""\nGirl #2: \""No....Seafood pan fried noodle\""\nWaiter: \""Ok\""\n\nfirst the garlic scallion chicken comes out first....almost halfway through eating it, we had to remind the waiter of our shumai. He clearly had forgotten about it and ran to go get it. Fortunately, the shumai was DELICIOUS. the second i bit in, my mouth automatically went MMMMMMMMMM. it was uncontrollable. \n\nthen our gf's pan fried noodles FINALLY come out.........guess what comes out? TWO beef pan fried noodles!!!!!!!\n\nmy gf pointed it out that she ordered the seafood noodle........and it was hte most awkward exchange ever. the waiter pauses \""OH No my mistake.......\"" pauses and looks at her.......and did not immediately even offer to take it back........and my gf is just like it's fine don't worry about it (she obviously didn't want to wait while we were almost done with our food) and he has a sigh of relief an djust leaves it.\n\nNO one comped her meal and he didn't even offer to take it back and just looked at her to see if she would just accept it! Thank goodness she even eats beef!\n\nterrible service, decent food (shumai helped, the chicken was too salty)."
0,"I thought this was a restaurant, but apparently it's just a hobby.\n\nDrove half an hour out of my way to a sign saying they were closed \""due to a family emergency.\"" Reading through other reviews, this is not an isolated incident and apparently happens with a fair amount of frequency. \n\nWe don't live in a communist country (yet)-  no one is mandating your hours. If you can't keep your own business hours, you should probably change them to something you CAN commit to.\n\nIf this were a one-time thing, I'd be inclined to be sympathetic- but clearly it isn't."
0,I go to North Scottsdale Gold' Gym. The gym and the equipments are excellent. Me and my husband are enrolled in 2 year contract. \nWhile signing the contract they said we have to pay 23 per person/month. They never mentioned that there is some semi annual fees in between.. And I have been charged 37.99 and 40 for my husband this month. \nBEWARE OF THE HIDDEN CHARGES THEY HAVE. Soon I am going to cancel my membership.
0,"First and far most people , I never write a bad review.  So imagine what an average experience I had. Actually, this isn't even a bad review. OMG but the food was just so average.I've been to better Thai restaurants in the past. The pad thai was not good and that's what it should be!! The curries were very rich with vegetables but again weren't delicious. I have nothing against this place, but if you have had really good thai food in other places, then you have raised the bar and won't like this place. So if you're trying Thai food for the first time...don't hit this place. Sorry for being honest, but look, I'm really obsessed with Thai food and have tried most of the thai restaurants in Pittsburgh, and this restaurant is not going on my favorite list. I don't care how many awards they have hanging on they wall. Just not going back there. Who cares what I think though, everyone has a different taste. So you might like it, just not me:-/"
0,"Walked in Monday was greeted with less then a welcoming feeling.Asked about the facial and wanted to get one but  they did not have the time I wanted til Thursday.So I booked it and then told I had to put a credit card on file to hold  the appointment.I did not feel comfortable doing that and I said can I call to see if you still have that spot open on Thursday? No the employee said I would have to walk in to get the appointment,I said no way I can't call?? No she says.Walked out and later found out the facial would have cost me 109.99 for a 60 min facial by a student that just graduated from esthetician school.I can get a 60 min facial from Aveda for less then 100.00 by a spa manager.(over 10 years experienced!) The prices are so over the top for what they offer and who gives them.I don't like the way you have to be a member to get the better price.Needless to say I will never get a service there because how the front desk acted and how Massage Envey operates."
0,I am really surprised that this place is still open. What a DUMP!!!
0,Horrible just horrible. Aren't they suppose to clean your teeth? I hate going to businesses with lazy workers. The Doctor is lazy. Go elsewhere for better work.
1,"I have had the honor of having some of Nicki's delicious cupcakes courtesy of my lovely coworker Jen who ordered some for my birthday as well as her surprise reveal as to where she was having a boy or a girl ( a boy). I had the Southern Red Velvetm Salted Carmel, Chocolate Chocolate, and Chocolate Chip Cookie in my birthday dozen and dear lord I was in cupcake heaven!!!  Plus delivers these decadent cupcakes to you personally! Now that is service!!  Dang it, now I want a cupcake!!"
0,"Wow, this place has one of the worst services I've experienced, in terms of shopping for a bridal gown. \n\nWhen I called them, they basically told me that it was getting late and that I wouldn't really be able to try on dresses, but I said I just really wanted to take a look at their collection, and they sort of grudgingly agreed.\n\nThen, when I got there, (still an hour and a half before the store closes), there were NO customers in the store, so I'm not sure why I was warned that they were so busy.\n\nAnyway, their collection is ok. Not as nice as Destiny's Bride or Mariee, but they have a lot of dresses to look through. I didnt find many newer styles, but I tried on three dresses, one of which was really pretty.\n\nI worked with this woman named Sue, who barely talked to me. She disappeared every time I tried on a dress, and sometimes forgot to help pin it on. One time, I came out holding this huge dress up, went in front of my family, and she just stared for a while, and then was like, \""Oh, I guess I should pin that\"". \n\nAfterwards, I asked for the details of the gown I liked, and she gave me a card with just her name. No gown information. So when I looked at her, confused, and asked about the gown, she literally said \""oh, its style .... \""... and then I asked, \""and the price?\"" and she just responded \""Oh, ....\""  I had to ask my family for a pen to write that down. How can you shop from a place like that?\n\nIt was ridiculous! Maybe Sue was having a bad day or just wanted to go home, but seriously, I was so offended and shocked by her attitude. I mean, the gowns are alright (and definitely less expensive than other places... ) but not worth the crappy service!\n\nI hate to pull this card out, but I'm south asian, and I really think that all the people I interacted with would have been a hell of a lot nicer if I wasnt."
0,"I tried to walk in to 2 other places nearby for a Sunday afternoon pedicure and was rejected at both due to closing time and a wait. Thanks to Yelp, I found this place right around the corner in an obscure location. It was desolate, which enabled me to walk right in and sit at one of the 8 pedicure stations. \n\nUpon first glance, the place was on the dingy side and wasn't the best atmosphere. I looked closer and the stations themselves were clean, but the supply carts, airbrush station, and areas behind the chairs were filthy.  The selection of polishes was slim and also needed some cleanup with lots of painted-on bottles (glad I brought my own!). People had test painted colors all over the rack of polishes.  It seems than one careless individual inspired everyone else to do the same (I had never seen this).  Even when visiting cheaper nail salons, I'd like them to have a clean and relaxing environment.  \n\nThe pedicure itself was pretty good when judging the quality of the nail job itself.  The technician was gentle and precise.  For $20, it was very good.\n\nI'm grateful to have found my Sunday pedicure....but think that US Nail & Spa won't be anywhere near the top of my list just because of the less than spa-like atmosphere.\n\nI waffled between 2 and 3 stars.  The atmosphere was definitely a 2....but because I'm now sitting at home with nice looking toes, I'd consider a 3.  But days later the place still gave me weird, dirty vibes.  It's a solid 2."
1,"The quality of restaurants -  of all retail vendors actually, but restaurants in particular - is  strongly influenced by the the amount of business they do with people \""just passing through.\""  \n\nThis is nowhere more apparent than in tourist hot spots, where crappy businesses can flourish on nothing but location and a working kitchen.  A prime location for a good restaurant is kind of like bottle-blonde hair and a boob job on an already attractive woman:  providing plenty of additional attention (frequently from uninformed hacks and wankers) while stifling future growth and quality.  Why bother if they're gonna come anyway? \n\nThere are tons of them in places like Scottsdale where people sweep in to enjoy the weather in winter then leave. There are tons of them everywhere. Yelp should actually institute some kind of transience coefficient to help identify such places so we can avoid them.  \n\nOh wait, they have.  You just go to an unfamiliar city and look for a place with lots of reviews by people who seem to respect food.  Then you physically locate the place (which can be tough since the only reason it's flourishing is due to local love, so it'll likely be some spot practically designed to hide from view).   Of course this process of exploration will probably get you out of your car and introduce many collateral discoveries - a useful benefit.  \n\nAnd when you've finally found it where you'll be is at The Orange Table."
0,"My puppies first grooming experience a nightmare!!! Came to get my malshi puppy groomed for the first time and she came back nothing like we had asked! My puppy is half Maltese and shihtzu so her breeds coat is that of a shihtzu. We told the groomer that we wanted a \""teddybear cut\"" and even pointed to the picture of a Maltese with the exact cut on the wall. The groomer told us that she would do that cut, however nearly 3 1/2 hours later we come back to find our puppy sloppily cut.. The groomer had shaved down all of her hair around her muzzle! That is not a teddybear cut! Any groomer should know that a teddybear cut requires you leave the length of the muzzle around and round out the face around the jaw line. She then left all her hair around the body long and cut her legs very thin at the bottom. My poor puppy looked absolutely awful. The groomers reasoning was that my puppies hair needed to grow out evenly so  \""she\"" decided to shave her muzzle down. Of course my puppy had plenty of hair around her face and muzzle to be able to wear a \""teddybear cut\"" .. I was livid. I ended up buying my own pet clipper set and shaved her down more evenly, however her face now looks like a poodle, and now it will take months to grow back! She also had knicks from the clipper on her stomach, and long patches of hair randomly around her mouth. Absolutely ridiculous ! I will never have my dog groomed there again!!!"
0,the waitress was nice but then again what waitress isnt \nwhen your in vegas.\nthe food was pretty predictable\nbland salsa & guacamole :(\nno refill on chips at all you gotta pay again for more chips!?!\nthats not cool.\nand almost everything besides the side orders are expensive\nsnd over-priced.\ni ordered the baked potato and it was very good for it being $4 \ncant beat that but dont expect a ehole meal at a decent price.
1,"After dinner at Windsor, we went next door to Churn, an ice cream shop with delicious homemade ice cream.\n\nChurn looks like a cutesy, old-timey ice cream shop with candy in see-through jars and homemade sweet treats tantalizing you in the display case.\n\nI had a really yummy peanut butter ice cream scoop in a waffle cone. One scoop is a generous enough portion, and the ice cream was so rich and creamy. There were also pretzel cones available, and I'd love to go back to try the sweet-and-salty combination.\n\nI couldn't resist also picking up a homemade snickerdoodle cupcake. It was so little, the perfect size if you want dessert but don't want to pig out. There were so many mouthwatering dessert options there, including fruit bars and cookies, I wanted to try them all. Churn is a must-try if you're in the area-just be warned, parking for both Windson and Churn is limited, and if you don't valet, you're stuck hunting for a spot on the street."
1,"Make no mistake, Max Brenner serves food, but it is only so you won't feel guilty about eating their chocolate desserts.  Hence they have a reminder on their menu - Food first then dessert.  Any place that gives you syringes filled with warm chocolate ganache to squirt in your mouth is a place worth visiting.  \n\nThe regular food menu did not have anything that really enticed my tastebuds - sandwiches, burgers, etc.  So we ordered some appetizers that sounded good.  Mac n cheese with marinara on the side - don't ask, that is a new one for me.  It was very cheesy, a bit salty, some bacon added, but nothing that great.  The waffle fries which are supposedly dusted with chili cocoa powder were run-of-the-mill.  I could not taste the difference with regular waffle fries and the dipping sauce they came with overwhelmed the dish with saltiness.  The hummus sampler was ok, a bit too bland, but the pita chips had a great crisp on the outside and soft on the inside.\n\nThe black and tan beer battered onion rings are worth a special mention.  Most beer battered onion rings I have had at other places are overfried and bland.  When you take a bit into these, you get a wonderful hoppy, malty flavor and aroma from the beer.  A bit of a surprise if you are not expecting it, but a depth of dimension you cannot find elsewhere.\n\nNow getting to the desserts.  The sharing tasting menu is a good starting point for those who can't decide.  It states on the menu that it is good for two but you can actually have 4 people share.  There is just wayyy too much chocolatey goodness for just 2 people.  It is comprised of :\nchocolate banana waffles\nchocolate crispy eggroll\nmilk and white chocolate bar\nchocolate sponge cake\ncrunchy little chocolate pearls\nchocolate fondue with grill and fruits and marshmallows\nand chocolate ganache to drizzle over everything.\n\nThe chocolate fondue is very fun as you can toast your marshmallows then dip into the melted chocolate.  After sharing this plate, I got a shock of chocolate euphoria which resulted from the the endorphin rush.\n\nAn absolute must have is the suckao.  Although the name makes it sound like a porno term, it is a combination of suck and cacao.  It is like the hot chocolate drinks that you can find in Europe.  You basically get a little container of milk (I recommend whole) which is kept heated over a little tea candle.  Then you also have a choice of what chocolate you want - dark, milk, or white (dark recommended).  From here you add the chocolate to the milk to your liking stirring with a spoon that doubles as a straw.  As the chocolate melts and combines with the milk, you get a rich chocolate beverage, essentially chocolate ecstasy.  You are technically making your own miniature ganache and drinking it.  Few things in life can produce such joy.  If you are not use to such huge amounts of chocolate, take caution as it will literally give you a high.\n\nBest Thing - Hot chocolate"
1,"Epic quest for one of the city's unique spot on a Sunday morning.\n\n1:00 pm: Brunch?\n1:30 pm: Arrived in front of l'Avenue and the line goes all the way to the end of the block. It is pouring outside\n3:00 pm: we are inside.\n\nA baroque place with street art influences overhung by an actual motorcycle attached to the ceiling and rocked by an electro DJ set. Loud vocal chords are recommended to communicate. \n\nThen comes the food... and I am full at 3:30 pm. Honestly, very rich menu providing you with unique egg combinations such as benedicts and chorizo. Juices are amazing and I recommend the orange-yogurt-maple sirup freshly squeezed mix. And next time I will get these Mimosa pitchers for sure. Your hangover will not resist to such a heavy brunch and a very pleasant service.\n\nHowever, numbers speak for themselves: you will wait a long time unless you go there during the week. More, waiters might prioritize their tectonik practice over getting tables ready in timely manners. Yes, I witnessed an extremely deep V-neck taking actually 15 minutes to clear a single table while dancing. Perhaps economics would be welcome here.\n\nAnyway. FULL. I WANT MY LARRY."
0,I was not impressed with this place. I love going downtown and I was hoping this would be my new hang out but their pizza was less than tasty and horrible customer service! They are pretty pricey for pizza that taste like card board.
1,"Visited vegas this weekend for the gun show took my ex-co worker to this place.

0,"WAS expecting the deliciousness of In-N-Out times two plus the options of Five Guys.... NOPE. Pretty much glorified cafeteria food. Hard store-bought bun, white iceburg lettuce, and limp pickles.\n\nNo unusual hamburger combos (like blue cheese, arugula, etc). No juicy beef patty. No fresh, ripe ingredients. No like!\n\nPlus the sodium on their fries is enough to cause a person to contract acute pitting edema :)\n\nWhy all the hype??"

0,"I use to eat at the Village Seafood Buffet when I lived here in Vegas. I am in town on business and thought I would go there for dinner on Friday night. I was shocked I got there about 615 PM and there was no line. But the line did show up right after I got in so this was the only plus. \nI was so set back on how poor the taste of the food was. The crab legs were dried out in side, like that the reheated the legs that went used the night before. The deep fried fish was cold and slimy inside. I took one bite of the lobster and almost lost my cookies, I was worried that I was going to get hit with food poison but it did not hit. \nThen to top it off I grab some stone crab claws, I grab one cracked it open and it was all moldy inside. I saw that I was totally scared to eat anything, stayed away sushi, the rolls. \nThe only think that was ok was the claim chowder\nI will not be back after paying 48.00 for old dried up food. I should have went to the Bellagio Buffet, had split king crab leg and peeled shrimp for 10.00 less. \nI will not be back\nService was a 4 star and I wish I could give 0 stars for the food."
1,Great prices and plenty of lanes. Used the yelp coupon for $10 for $20 worth of bowling and the kids bowl free coupon and played 2 games for 3 people for a total of $12. They also have ramps for the young kids that our 3 year old used since all the lighter balls were being used. Would never have found this place without doing a Google search considering it is almost in the middle of a neighborhood but I will definitely be back! And $1.50 drafts during happy hour! Glad I finally found a new alley instead of Amf.
1,"The only dim sum I've had in Vegas, but it's done well at Ping Pang Pong! Okay yes, the name is pretty ridiculous and stereotypical to Chinese people, but don't let that turn you off! This place is pretty legit.\n\nA lot of reviewers mention that the wait is pretty crazy, but I've came here on weekdays only and never had to wait for a table, so maybe it's only crazy on weekends?\n\nAll the dishes we've had were good, but we've only came here for dim sum, so I'm not sure (but curious) how their other food is.\n\nService is decent, which I'm used to at Chinese restaurants, so it's good enough for me!\n\nKind of shocked that this place was noted as the 'Best Chinese Restaurant of 2011'. Is nothing good in Chinatown then? Haha."

This is why I come here after fun night of drinking and clubbin.\n\n6oz ham steak that hits the spot served with hash browns, eggs, and toast. For this price, you can't complain and it'll satisfy your munchies, especially the drunken munchies.\n\nDefinitely come here for late night cravings, or if you're broke from gambling and need some food to comfort you."
1,"I like it here.  The pizza is pretty good, the wings are awesome!  Lots of good deals to be had here and the service has always been speedy and courteous.  Very easy to feed a large group for not a lot of cash. I agree with the below comment.. very clean place, even the ladies room is nice and clean (hard to come by)  which is very much appreciated."

1,"Jane Kinney did my wedding flowers. I did not care about the flowers at my wedding as much as other details, so I went very minimalistic. Jane did not do anything super creative for my wedding, but she executed what I asked her to do and I thought it was beautiful. She made great suggestions to me, a person who doesn't know a tulip from a lilac. She also helped with season-appropriate flowers and was very professional to work with. She was disappointed when she arrived and could not help us set up because the tables were not set up. I enjoyed working with Jane and found her prices to be extremely reasonable. She was also able to incorporate pieces of the extra fabric from my dress to wrap my bouquet. It was beautiful. \n\nIf you pay in cash or check, she throws in something free like an extra toss bouquet or something of the sort."
0,"I was a little dubious at going from Chicago to Las Vegas and ending up at yet another Lettuce Entertain you restaurant, but I was staying at the Paris and the location right along Las Vegas Boulevard and looking at the Bellagio fountains was very nice.  \n\nMy friend and I went for a late lunch.  I had an okay glass of pouilly fuisse at $12, a $15 cheese flight of okay but grocery-store quality cheese and then we got the oysters.\n\nMy friend very much wanted to treat me to something special and ordered a dozen oysters on the half shell.  They came to the table and we both looked at each other and hesitated because they smelled really fishy.  However, we both tried one and both had the same reaction: There was no way we were eating more.  \n\nI called the waiter over, let him know that we found the oysters fishy but that it might just be us and there was no need to take them off the bill.  His response? \""Whatever.  They're milky and people love them but if you don't like them I'll take them away.\""  And he did.  We ordered the country pate and my friend got a seafood crepe that she liked.  The pate was okay, but the service was crap from that point on, of course.\n\nOh, and the french bread sucked.  I should have known after so many Lettuce Entertain You disappointments here in Chicago that this would be no better.  I felt really bad that my friend shelled out $75 for such a mediocre lunch."
0,"It seems they have pretty steady local business and for that, I'm happy.  I do wish the restaurant success as the staff was very nice but my meal was very underwhelming and nothing I would even consider trying again.  For $9 I had a sandwich which left me hungry as it was awfully small.  The sandwich was pressed on the grill and still came out cold and flavorless.  For $25 for lunch for two, it should at least leave me full.  Good for them on the profit margin though.  Selling two slices of thin bread, 3 oz of roast beef, and a tomato for $9 is a lucrative racket."
0,"Looking at all the other fantastic reviews for this place I was really hoping for a better product. I bought 6 cupcakes for a birthday dinner (chocolate, chocolate oreo, red velvet, lemon, mixed berry, and coconut). I have to say that I was extremely disappointed by the taste, and texture of all of the flavors. The cupcakes were dry, dense, and had very little flavor. The overall presentation of the cupcakes was very cute, and they were decorated wonderfully, however that did not make up for the taste. After paying over $3 a cupcake I was really expecting something better. I was almost embarrassed to serve these to my friends and family. I will give it two stars because it was a nice little coffee shop in a great location. I can only base this review off of the cupcakes, I haven't tried any of their other food, but I sure do hope that the rest of their menu tastes better than their cupcakes."
1,"We end up eating here often as it's close to home. We often get the pretzel twists which are huge and we often have leftovers because we want to actually eat our meal. \n\nThe $5 burger Mondays is great especially when you have kids who want one. I have had several of the salads and they're very good.\n\n Unfortunately, the only thing I did try to eat one time, was the fish and chips and it was not good at all. Everything else I've tried so far including the meatloaf was done pretty well."
1,These guys were AWESOME! Great service.. Great food. I NEVER finish hashbrowns.. and they didn't saturate theirs in grease.. ugh! Just fantastic place. Loved it!
0,"First time at BabyStacks was ok. Nothing to write home about. I think I would like to try it again just to see. The plain pancakes were solid. The corned beef hash was bland and the potatoes were underdone. My boyfriend had the orange creme pancakes and said they were ok, though the syrup tasted artificial. The garlic rice is quite something, but you better LOVE garlic because it's strong. Like I said- I'd try it again and would probably get something more characteristically Hawaiian- like some sort of spam scramble. I suspect that they get that right."
1,Staff was so friendly and they did a great job shaving down my girls. I'm going out of town soon and I think I'll board my dogs here too
1,My family has been going to the Scottsdale location for many years and its been our favorite place for Chinese food ever since.  When I discovered that they opened this \nlocation in the Northwest Valley my wife and I were really excited. They really do have the best Chinese food!  Kung Pao Beef and Crispy Spicy Pork are delicious! My wife always gets the chicken and vegetable! Lots of food for the money and always fresh and delicious.
0,"The place started out well, a young woman at the counter offered to help us, before she could take our order, the phone rang. She got involved in a long order with many questions, the man at the counter finished helping his customer, glanced over and walked away without saying a word. We had never been there before, so he couldn't have had a bad experience with us, but that's how he acted. Maybe we resembled someone he hated. He wandered aimlessly around the restaurant while we waited. Ordered the Wrangler, the eggs and potatoes were standard quality, the pure pork sausage seemed good when hot, but as it cooled down seemed to be full of soy filler or something. The sourdough toast was good, although I suspect they use margarine, not butter on it.  There were tables outside, as we left someone was smoking there. First and last visit."
1,"Great selection of about 30 mostly European beers along with maybe five wines on tap. A pretty basic food menu. An $11 order of tacos gives you two tasty tacos, probably not enough for a full dinner. Nice, pretty spacious outdoor patio. Definitely go for the beer."
1,"We went there last week. Everything was delicious. We tried yentafo, hoi tod, and pork salad. The server was very nice. they have great price too"
1,"One of the bigger pool parties I've been too. Definitely is spacious enough for busy weekends/special events.\n\nThey have 2 big pools and a lazy river. There are plenty of bars around. \n\nLove their nachos! Not too spicy but has a kick. The frozen drinks are tasty, but can't taste the alcohol!! Tastes more like non-alcoholic drinks! For $34 (biggest size) and $24 souvenir mugs I expect to get a little more buzzed!\n\nThe music at the Producer's Pool and way louder and more poppin'. \n\nTip: They are super strict on entry. They actually swipe your key card to make sure it's still active."

1,"I have been visiting this Cheesecake Factory long before I moved to Las Vegas. The multiple levels is a architectural design element not seen in other restaurants, but is necessary because they get so much traffic. It is located at the very end of The Forum Shops commected to Caesars Palace.\n\nHaving to wait to get in and the long journey it takes to get to this location from the casino, are the only two drawbacks. Everything else, including the staff and food have always been good.\n\nIt is near a large aquarium and an animatronic show with fire and water, so those help to pass the time. If you are walking around Las Vegas and want to enjoy a nice dinner from a restaurant you know, try this one out."
1,"The word \""ramen\"" usually conjures up 10 cent instant noodle packs you can buy at the gas station; the main food staple for many college students. However, ramen at Umami is anything but that. My boyfriend and I split a bowl of tonkotsu ramen and a small order of pork and chive dumplings. The dumplings were good, but nothing to write home about. The ramen was pretty good, although the broth was a little on the salty side. I was skeptical about the flavored egg at first because I hate eggs, but I tried some anyway and it was pretty good. The seaweed and braised pork rounded out the flavors in the ramen. Overall, I would recommend Umami for their ramen."
1,The pho is pho real. Really good food for a minimal price. They also give a military discount. Their Vietnamese sandwiches are pretty decent. Place is cramped so don't bring a huge party.
1,"Peking Garden is a delightful locale, and definitely one to visit as an ironic hipster in graduate school.  The decorations are garish, the food is 'authentic' in that way that Chinese food is translated for Middle America.  \n\nI found myself @ Peking Garden celebrating a friends' completion of his prelims.  Nate decided that he was going to have a Mai Tai, and it came in a disturbing Fu-Manchu mug complete with exaggerated Asian features.  I was horrified and delighted simultaneously.\n\nBut not as delighted as when my friend Emily and I orderd the \""Hawaii + Love Bowl,\"" a gigantic bowl of alcohol filled with cherries and anchored in the center by a small well of rum--SET ON FIRE.\n\nHells yes.  Because nothing says, \""I've just moved to a small Midwest college town\"" like \""Let's consume the flaming jungle juice of the gods, ladies and gentlemen!\""\n\nThe food was good, although I found my shrimp fried rice as boring as it sounds.  That was my fault for ordering it, not theirs for making it.  I sampled everyone else's dishes however, and they were quite tasty.  And when my uppity friend Myra bellowed that she didn't like our fortunes, they gave us brand new fortune cookies.  Except the second time--my fortune was blank.  Please Jesus, tell me that doesn't mean I'm going to die from drinking the \""Hawaii + Love Bowl.\"""

1,"Very Nice!  The service was wonderful, the portions were huge, and the food was excellent.  There were 6 in my party:  1 had the Ribeye, 2 had the Sea Bass (catch of the day) and 3 had the Queen Cut Prime Rib.  Everyone was very pleased with their food (I had the sea bass - Yum), and we couldn't believe how large the \""Queen cut\"" of Prime Rib was!\n\nIt's pricey, but pretty much everything in Las Vegas is.  I would go back again, given the chance."
1,"The very first buffet I've had in Las Vegas!\n\nAward for presentation goes to Wicked Spoon! Everything is packaged into cute, individual boxes, plates, bowls, etc. The food here isn't bad either to be honest. Nothing like other buffets that serve bland and lackluster foods. And... drum roll plz... They have prime rib! For brunch!\n\nOur server was extremely nice as well, I was a tad surprised at the amount of hospitality."
1,"I was in Vegas for my birthday (May 15th) and decided I wanted to eat at Veggie House. Yes, it's that good (to me anyway). \n\nAs usual, the Chef stopped by and talked with us. The food was divine. Can't wait to come back the next time I'm in Vegas. \n\nThe waitresses are wonderful and as usual, attentive to our needs.\n\nThank you for a super yummy meal on my birthday and plenty of leftovers for later."
0,"Gross! Gross! Gross! Gross! Gross!. Need I say more? How how HOOOWWW do you ruin chicken nachos?!?!?! I mean, if that isnt the EASIEST appetizer to make, then I dont know WHAT is. They were cold but the cheese was burnt. WTF?? The chips were stale and overly disgusting. Needless to say, I told the \""waitress\"" that I just could NOT eat them and she took them off my bill. I wound up paying about 4 bucks for a glass of coke. -_- And to top it all off, the customer service was non-existent. Never AGAIN. Save yourself the horrible experience and just visit the express Pizza Hut or Burger King across the way. BLAH!!"
1,"Great Tacos! As good as it gets.  Probably the second best tacos I have ever had, finishing a close second behind Taco Guild!!!"
1,"Big fan of this chain. Love the chicken artichoke dish and the voodoo tuna. Recently discovered brunch, I got the quesadilla with tomatillo sauce and it was delicious. My man got the french toast, big, fluffy and tasted like candy. \n\nNow the best part: $3 your choice of vodka and a MAKE YOUR OWN BLOODY MARY BAR!!! Whoohoo! They have everything you can possibly imagine, including 4 different mixes to choose from."
0,"BUYER BEWARE!! \n\nMy Wife also purchased a Living Social deal with the hopes of having a nice clean house. We should of known something was up when we tried for a couple of weeks to get a hold of someone at the company to make an appointment or at least return our calls. \n\nRight about the time we were going to stop trying and get a refund from Living Social, my Wife was able to get a hold of someone. She spoke with a female at the company and set up an appointment for a cleaning on the 15th, between 11-12. \nAfter the appointment was set up my Wife received an email from Living Social confirming her use of the voucher. My Wife reply saying she has only made the appointment and the services have not been used. \n\nSo, Friday the 15th rolls around and we should of seen this coming, no one shows up. At 12:00 I call the number on the voucher and website, no answer, so I leave a message. Then we notice on their Facebook account they give a number to text for urgent matters.

0,"Yelp has failed me...I went here based on the reviews I found on here, only to find a restaurant that has fallen off from what it used to be. \n\nI guess this use to be a chef driven restaurant, he created a name for the place. But whatever it is now it has definitely fallen off and definitely not good. \n\nThe space is nice enough, I really did not enjoy sitting at the bar and have to look at there dirty kitchen the whole time...But the place does offer a pleasant enough atmosphere. \n\nThe food on the other hand was bad. I had the tasting of the appetizers in which everything was overcooked (mushy eggplant) or overcooked and Burnt (anything that had bread like potential) I kinda of wanted to leave after this but I had ordered my Salmon entree from the start... \n\nAnd now on to the entree which consisted of overcooked salmon, burnt spices on the top, and RAW skin underneath, did not make any since to me. it came with a brick of polenta edible only by the pool of sauce on the plate. \n\nThe menu and idea of this restaurant is great, sharp contrasts and bold flavor, but the technique and care is definitely lack here, or maybe they just had a shitty cook that day, I don't know, I just know that I will never make my way back there."
0,"Today's review is a challenge as it's more about the service than the food itself.  If you want the Readers Digest version of the report, skip to the bottom paragraph.  \n\nMom and I went there for dinner.  It was a Saturday night and the outside patio was packed, but it turns out that was a private party, the inside was much more free.  \n\nThe Hostess greeted us with a welcome and asked if we had a reservation.  I asked \""Do we need one?\""  She replied we did not a lead us to a table in the corner near the front window.  We were only a party of two but she sat us at a 4-top, with plenty of twos available.  I guess they were not planning on being busy that night...?\n\nHere's where the poor part of the evening began, with our waitress.  She came to the table without introduction and asked if we wanted drinks.  We did not so she quickly departed allowing us time to peruse the menu.  When she returned, her first words were, \""Have you decided?\""  Biting my tongue for fear of the endless comebacks I could have used, I asked about specials.  She jumped into recall-mode and tried to think about what was being offered, all without pricing or recommendations. \n\nOne of the items was interesting but not enough to make me change my mind on what I was intending on having.  I chose the Lasagna which comes with a soup or salad.  I chose the salad.  There must only be one choice as she did not ask me about my preferences so I have to assume its the only option.  Mom chose the Italian Wedding Soup which on the menu was listed as a single item but the waitress then asked \""Large or Small?\""  Wouldn't \""Cup\"" or \""Bowl\"" be more appropriate?\n\nThe other thing that chapped my ass about this waitress was the fact that we were there well before 6pm and there are Early Bird Dinner specials offered from 3-6 which she never suggested and looked to be a great value...about 6 separate items all for $9.95 each all of them something would like, too!\n\nA basket of bread was brought out along with some Whipped Garlic & Herb Butter.  The bread was exceptionally dried out and squished as though it was cut when it was too hot and then left to air-dry into something reminiscent of old Scones.  Thank god for the butter, its what made he bread tolerable.  \n\nMy salad arrived along with moms Wedding Soup.  Here is where he marks on this place are salvaged.  The Salad was perfectly proportioned, not too much or little.  The Soup was delicious as well.  OK, I am feeling a little redemption coming on here.  \n\nGetting my plate taken away was slow but a bus person finally came by and removed it.  We also requested at that time a refill of water and some fresh bread.  When it arrived this time, the bread was far better than the left overs served to us 20 minutes earlier.  (Maybe they heard us griping about it and this was their attempt at redeeming themselves) \n\nMy Lasagna finally arrived and this was impressive when first set down on the table.  Large portion, well presented and very tasty.  Lasagna is an interesting food item as its different everywhere you go.  Not always great but usually OK.....This was wonderful!  It was actually such a large portion I took about 1/2 of it home with me.  This, I would order again!\n\nOne thing we notices was the owner and his wife (mother?) walking around and stopping at a few tables.  Based on the conversations we could hear, they were all regulars.  What about us newbie's??  Do we not rate a quick stop to see how things are going??  This is YOUR restaurant and you want to keep the customers coming back, that should include the new guys too, right?  Never happened.  I felt like the red-headed step-child of the restaurant.   \n\nOnce finished, we again had a new delay in getting the plates cleared as well as the waitress to come back by.  She finally did and asked if were interested in dessert but there was no room for me so we asked for the check.  Another delay.  It was delivered, hand written like in an old-school diner.  We left a credit card and again, another delay in getting it picked up.  \n\nFinally she dropped it by the table and said her thank you's....obviously a dinner bill of under $20 was not going to net her a huge tip so there was no need for small talk from her.  \n\nAs we departed the owner and his wife said thank you and good night.  I stopped to ask him what the waitress's name was  who served us.  He mentioned it and asked \""Why, was everything all right?\""  I replied that I was curious as to her name since she never introduced herself and I was just curious as to whom had served us.  Funny, I still cannot remember it since it was only said one time in the whole evening.  Not that it matters now. \n\nThe wrap up...Lousy service, never felt like I was a welcome part of the restaurant BUT great food.  I liked what I had and would certainly try it again....but probably would want to order ahead and get it to go.  The ambiance and setting of home is far nicer than being treated like a outsider at this place."
0,"This place is very small and gets crowded very quickly. It is a frustrating experience every time I go in there. People are standing around since there is little seating and the line goes right into the dining area. Too small! They are also pretty slow at getting the food out to the customers which is surprising since it's just a bagel shop. Their coffee is terrible, too.\n\nThe actual food is good. I get the Lox and haven't been disappointed, I just hate going in there to get it."

Chase was very informative and I could immediately tell he knew his stuff.  Additionally, I knew I wasn't going to break the register with my budget minding purchase and was impressed that I wasn't made to feel like 'i needed to spend more or that 'I was wasting his time which is how I have felt elsewhere.  I was very pleased with the service, selection, and pricing and made my decision to purchase immediately because it is obvious that this local business knows how to treat their customers and is interested in doing business the right way!  Not only will Chase and Mike get my business, they will also get very positive feedback to anybody in the market for car stereo equipment from this customer!"

0,"Y'all are officially on notice.  Why?  It was based on these reviews that I decided to try the place.\n\nI was totally prepared to wait when we arrived because we got there at about 7:15 on a Friday night.  They said 30 min wait for a party of 5. Not too bad.  After watching 3 groups who came in after us be seated first (and yes, one was a party of 5) we approached the hostess stand to check on things.  Suddenly we were \""next\"".\n\nServer was Justin.  He said his hellos, told us about the specials, took our drink orders. We'd planned to try a few appetizers, but at that point we were all hungry enough we wanted to go right for the main course. Then we were brought the chips and salsa.  I inquired about the 3 salsas.  He said, this one is hot, this one is pico de gallo, and this is our pineapple salsa.  The chips weren't just \""got out of a bag\"" chips, they were no-name, not very good, wouldn't serve them to my friends chips.  But, we nibbled on them anyhow because we wanted to try the salsas.  I went right for the hot.  Hot?  It was barely warm.  It was very \""tomato\"" tasting, with one person commenting that it almost had spagetti sauce taste.  How can you be going for a Latin flavor and not be packing any heat??  I try the \""Pico de gallo\"".  It's chunky salsa.  But whatever.  It had that fresh taste that many salsas have fresh out of the bottle.  My last hopes were the pineapple salsa.  It was different, and in the end the one I actually liked the most because at least they were trying to be creative.\n\nCan you believe I'm not to the main courses yet?  Justin sets them down quickly and makes his escape.  Visually - they were quite good.  2 of our folks got tortas - one beef and one chicken.  They were \""fine\"".  Both tortas and the burgers come with fries and the fruit slaw on the side. No one liked the slaw.(Friend said it was more straw than slaw)  To me, it was ok - but not worthy of the large portion it took on the plate.  Would have been MUCH better to just fill the plate with the waffle fries that were actually pretty good.  One person got shrimp enchiladas.  That was pretty good - but could have been done just as well or better by quite a few places in town.  I got the pork loin chops.  Honestly - with this being one at their highest price point, I figured I should really get to see their strength here.  It was pretty.  The two thin chops were cooked fine - but it wasn't cooked IN anything for extra flavor, which pork really needs.  It touted an \""herby garlic, cilantro, lime sauce\"".  It was green, and not bad, but with those things you would have thought it might have had more kick.  Or at least flavor. It wasn't bad in a way that detracted from the meal, but it didn't add much.  The green beans were at that same \""fine\"" point.  They were very green and looked great.  But beyond the almonds someone threw on top (again, not cooked with at all, just threw on top at the last minute) there wasn't much flavor.  ( I buy the big frozen bag from Trader Joe's, steam them, toss w/ a pat of butter, salt and pepper and they could kick the butt of these green beans. I didn't have that high of a bar, but they didn't even meet it.)\n\nThe night was capped with some poor service mistakes.  Several of us had discussed trying a desert.  Instead of a request for desert, we got a check.  We figured it was a sign.  We were dividing the check into 2.  A friend who had been a server suggested that we mark the items that went on a particular card and then it was easiest for them to split the check.  We were explaining that to Justin as he was seemingly running from the table. (Did we have ebola and no one told us?)  When he accidentally put the wrong total on each card, and we asked him to switch the totals, rather than go do it, he was argumentative at the table for several minutes about how he did it right and kept trying to push fault to the friend who handed him the bill. he then stormed from the table (like a 2 yr old) saying as he went, \""Fine, I'll just have to go switch them\"".  Yea, that's all we'd been going for.  The whole table felt uncomfortable and insulted.  A friend noticed we were \""dropped off\"" to go boxes when all other tables had their food taken away and the server put them in the boxes.  I don't know if we just had an awful server or if he thought we'd be bad tippers (I've never gone under 20% for good service - bad never gets less then 15%) but it will be a long time before any of us go there again. The atmosphere was cute, but the food was not a good value and never really rose above \""Ok\""."
1,"a hole-in-the-wall joint with a great staff and simple but delicious food. the salsa bar has a fantastic avocado salsa!\n\ngreat ceviche, and the other items are served in a standard, quick-service mexican style. order at the counter, then take your seat. they have a large selection of bottled mexican beers and mexican-style coca-cola. \n\nthis is one of my standbys in maricopa. it definitely beats the other greasy spoon chains."
0,"This is the most unprofessional practice ever.  I don't even know how they have two locations. When we called they scheduled us for one location. Then when we got there, they were closed. So when we called they said our appt was at their other location. So we had to reschedule again because of their unprofessionalism. Then on our second appt, they made us wait over an hour and a half to be seen for cleaning and X-rays. A week later we called to pick up the X-rays and they told us to come pick it up at 9am. So we get there at 9 and no one was there. We then called their other office to see when they would open and they said they had no idea when someone would be there. Are you kidding me?  So we waited til 9:50 before someone opened the doors. And to top everything off they charged us $20 ea for paper copies of the X-rays. No film, no disk, just two pieces of papers   This place is truly a joke and we are sad we even crossed paths with them. Beware everyone!"
1,"Good experience here! Went on a Wednesday evening and it wasn't busy at all. Thought that may be a sign of what was to come but it most certainly was not. The restaurant has a $25 corkage fee which we though was reasonable and they were more than accommodating with our champagne. The interior was cool, the bar area had some neat decor and overall had a pretty inviting atmosphere. \n\nHighlight of the night: Michael, our server. Great guy, great recommendations and genuinely a good dude! Chat him up if given the opportunity, he's got some tales to tell!\n\nOverall, food was good. The sashimi grade scallops were done to perfection, literally melted in your mouth. We were going to do the crab cakes, but Michael recommended the scallops... so glad he did! They were delicious. Then we had the BBQed salmon and some white-sauce/shrimp/pasta dish that I can't remember the name of at the moment... the salmon was done perfectly, the prawns and pasta were smothered in garlic (overwhelming or nauseatingly delicious, depends how much you like garlic!), the andouille sausage and potato hash was great... only problem was the onion rings that came with the salmon. They were SO over-seasoned that it was difficult to enjoy them with the other components of the dish. Granted, southerners tend to season a little more liberally than others... stereotype? I don't know, after watching some TV shows on southern food I think it's probably true! Regardless, we were happy with out meals.\n\nSecond highlight of the night: the banana cream pie!!!!! If you're like me, it doesn't sound all that appetizing. Until you see it!! Man, what a dessert... so tasty, we debated seconds for 10 minutes!"
1,"Walking past this location on pretty much any given morning, it's apparent that this is a Las Vegas favorite. The packed parking lot and surrounding curb, a taxi dropping off a fare, cop cars, and the out-of-state plated cars remind me why this modest-looking joint is my choice breakfast locale.\n\nThe great: The food. It's that simple. My favorite single item is their french toast. 4 wedges and I'm in heaven (and full). I also enjoy their meatloaf and after a night of drinking, the (huge!) breakfast burrito is quite satisfying. The prices are reasonable too, and you generally get a lot of food for the money. \n\nThe not-so-great: I hate to say it, but the service is not as consistent as I'd like. Late night the servers are always super-attentive, but during the day is another story. It seems like it has little to do with how busy they are, as I've gone on a weekday mid-afternoon and the place is maybe 1/4 full and the service was worse than a visit on a bustling Sunday morning. \n\nStill, there's a reason why people from all walks of life come in, it's quite the breakfast joint."
1,"woohoo. I love sprouts. It has almost everything and it's the perfect size because it's not overwhelmingly large. Also everyone is in a good mood... The customers, the employees, everyone. I'm always asked if I need help and the ppl that work in the soap and supplement area really know what they are talking about it seems. I just like this store. Alot."
0,"I was very disappointed with the service or lack there of from benefit air. \n\nMy A.C. unit wasn't working properly so I called Benefit heating and air. I was charged a $79 service for the tech to come out which seems to be standard with most of the companies. From the moment Chuck the tech came out he was only concerned with selling me a new unit. He spent almost all of his time taking measurements and giving me a quote on a $9000 new unit. When he finished I asked him if he repaired or replaced anything and he said no. When it was all said and done I paid $79 for a quote on a new unit. \n\nIN MY OPINION THEY SENT OUT A SALESMAN NOT A TECH.\n\nAfter he left I called around for a second opinion. I found a company that didn't charge a service fee for coming out. The new tech arrived, determined the problem within 10 minutes and asked if I wanted it repaired for $149.00. What would you have done? $9000 or $149? That was a no brainer for me. \n\nBenefit heating and air was NO BENEFIT to me.\n\n( In response to Michaels reply )\n\nI did contact Michael who apologized for my negative experience and offered and sent out a refund of my $79.  \n\nThanks again Michael"
1,"I'm no Korean/Hawaiian food expert, but this place has lived up to the hype.  Thanks Jade for the recommendation.  Myself and a few coworkers came here today, and not a single one of us wasn't impressed.\n\nFirst off, the kimchi is bomb here.  I can usually leave out the kimchi, but that's only because so many places in Vegas have mediocre kimchi.  Not this kimchi.  You'll get this as an appetizer, so even if you are not a kimchi person you have to try it.  Our server (the owner?) sensed my coworker's enthusiasm over the kimchi, being the kimchi fanatic that he is, and complimented us some dumplings.  Off the hook.  The crust was kind of thick, but not greasy at all.  The meat was delicious, great spice and herb flavor.  A good sign of things to come...\n\nI ordered the Hot Rock Bi Bim Bap.  Friggin tasty.  Quality beef, super fresh veggies, and really nice Kochujang(?) sauce.  The Kochujang was slightly sweet but not too sweet, and subtly flavored.  What set this dish apart for me was the high quality for just around $10.00.  Oh, and don't forget the crystallized rice grains at the bottom. Despite gorging myself on refills of kimchi, I couldn't stop eating the Bi Bim Bap until every last rice grain was gone.  Just a great version of this classic Korean dish!\n\nI also managed to taste my friend's bulgolgi.  I normally don't like bulgolgi because it is always tough and overly sauced.  Not this bulgolgi, which is the best I have ever had.  VERY tender, and expertly seasoned.  The sauce was light and of a homemade quality.  Just delicious!\n\nAgain, special thanks to Jade and the other Yelpers.  I don't know why it has taken me so long to try Island Style.  If you don't know if you like Korean food, this is the place to try it.  If you don't always feel like Korean food, this is the place to go when you do.  If you are a Korean food snob, give Island Style a try and let me know what you think!"
1,Welcome to the best hidden boba shop in the clutter of china town! Fresh fruit instead of syrup makes this the go to place!! Add an order of dumplings and you are set! Top notch !
0,"Stingray's decor tries hard to be sheik with exotic looking wood veneers and a trendy  retromod kind of feel. It reminds me of something one might see in \""The Incredibles\"" movie. It does work quite well at night, but falls apart a bit in the daylight (been there twice). This fact actually says alot about the place in general.\n\nOn our first visit, we had a server who I named \""like-megan\"". Possibly she refers to herself this way- hence the name.\nAnyway- \""like-megan\"" proceeded to tell the table in a wholly unsolicited manner how she was \""like soooo into food\"". This made me want to ask her exactly what brand of wholesale imitation crab meat that Stingray uses. But alas my more gentlemanly instincts won.\n \nAs for the food- I've had my fair share of maki, but am no expert on the subject. It seemed, \""like-pretty good\"". Not amazing, but  fresh tasting and nicely prepared. How else can one remark about Scottsdale sushi rolls except that they are safe to consume?\n\nOverall, if you are into seeing and being seen in S Scottsdale, I would say that Stingray is probably a pretty good choice- particularly the patio. I would, however,  stay completely away from superficially fussing about how \""like soooo yummy\"" the food is. You might end up \""like megan\""."
0,"Never thought I'd write a bad review of this place.  It's been my \""go to\"" neighborhood restaurant for at least five years.  After a long, hard day at work, I often go by myself for some good food and relaxed atmosphere on the restaurant side of the place.\n\nLast night I ordered a gorgonzola burger. My burger came out with a very mild, yellow cheese on it.  I decided to eat it anyway, as I was starving, but mentioned to my server that I had ordered gorgonzola and gotten cheddar.  I declined a different burger, as I'd already started eating and it was fine, just not what I'd ordered.  She came back in a few minutes to tell me that the chef had told her that the cheese *was* gorgonzola, and that cheddar melted brown and gorgonzola melted yellow.  I respectfully disagreed.  \n\nWhen my check came, I was charged for a gorgonzola burger.  I asked that the charge for the burger be reduced to the price of a regular cheeseburger (about a dollar).  This prompted a visit by the bartender, but no offer to adjust my bill.  There was also an extra dollar charge on my bill, which was either for gorgonzola cheese or sweet potato fries -- I couldn't figure it out, and no one came back to answer questions.  I paid the bill, but they have lost a long-time, regular customer."
1,"I have stayed here three or four times since I wrote my first review.  The place is consistently good.  I had a chance to hang out in the lobby lounge as well as the attached restaurant/bar (District).  Both top notch with nice people about (both staff and clientele).  Expect, of course, to pay hotel prices for your libations."
0,"Went to this place a couple years back with family during a trip to Vegas and loved it! Ordered all-you-can eat. My dad even got sick for over-eating! We couldn't wait to visit again this time.\n\nWe ordered alligator tail as appetizers this time and they were yummy. However, the all you can eat platters we normally order was good only towards the END. It seemed as if the oil used to fry our fish and shrimp initially was old...yuck! I don't even want to know how old. At the end of our meal (as they brought our new batches) it seemed to taste better. I like to enjoy my food in the beginning. I inquired with our waitress about the oil used and she confirmed that she did see one of the chefs change the oil to fresh oil at the end. Whack! The salad bar was pretty sad too and didn't look like anyone maintained cleanliness. Might be helpful to put the same items on both sides - makes it easy to maneuver and avoid spills. I did like how they kept plates chilled for it though. \n\nOur service was good and our waitress did her job. Sadly, we've lost our craving for this place. It just isn't the same.\n\nNote: Despite what time your stomach says let's eat, this place opens at 5 p.m. - we went at 3 with ready bellies the day before and had sour faces :("
0,"I probably would have dined here once a week, but the cook would not serve me vinegar with my pizza because it was not how she was serving it.  Really? What if it is how I wanted to eat it. I eat out 5 nights per week, not one chef ever refused to do anything they could to please."
0,"Back to my Vegas trip...\n\nWe came here after walking around on the strip and aside from the place being super dark I was kind of excited to see what they had to offer.  First we must have came in the back way because I couldn't find the hostess or a server walking about.  Finally tracked one down and after some finagling we got seated upstairs.  The upstairs was nice but we didn't get a good seat to view the strip so we got tucked away in a corner which probably lead us to being ignored for a good 30 mins before we even got our drinks let alone placed our order.  I should have taken the cue to leave then.  We placed our orders and the waiter disappeared for another hour and finally brought back our food.  Seemed he was preoccupied with the lovely ladies in the other part of the restaurant.  I don't blame him, but at least check back once in a while.  We ate and left, the place was decorated well but the food was pretty mediocre.  Disappointing."
0,"Old, dark and dirty place! Very expensive and the food  wasn't that great! Not recommend this place!"
0,"I was appalled by the lack of flexibility on the part of the management with regard to dietary restrictions. One of our party of 9 adults asked for a salad since they are a strict vegan and the management would not serve any vegetables in the form of a salad at lunchtime on the weekend, even though they clearly had vegetables on the premises. Furthermore, when asked if we could eat our own avocado, we were told that there would be a charge for giving a plate!!!! I do believe the server felt terrible that one guest could not be accommodated at all. With the number of people with allergies and health concerns, I am flabbergasted that a new restaurant such as this could have such a rigid and disrespectful attitude towards a patron.\n\nNeedless to say, we won't be back."
1,"I love this place 4am-9am haha\nSo I tried it for dinner one night, and I was pleasantly surprised. It was delicious and really good quality. \n\n\nStill a great after hours dive feel"
1,I confess that I was thrown-off by the one-star review by another reviewer.  I had a totally different experience and feel like it's only right to give this place the five stars it deserves.  I had excellent service.  My mom is close to passing and I had to get a suit altered on short notice.  The customer service was excellent in that they were very accommodating.  They did such a great job in such a short time.  What stood-out most is that the lady there asked about my mom when i picked-up the suit... so overwhelmingly thoughtful... Thank you
0,"I have to say that I LOVE Elephant Bar, in general.  Happy hour is a great deal, and the portions are perfect.  The drinks are fun and yummy.  I've loved the Scottsdale location and the Henderson location.  We just moved, and this EB is about 10 minutes from our new house.  In the last three weeks, we've been there three times.  I keep going back wanting to love it as much as I have in the past, at other locations...but I just can't.  The servers don't seem to smile (suggests to me that morale sucks at this location), the food is so-so, and tonight we got something brought to the table COLD..twice...and it should've been steaming hot.  Both my husband and I have had upset tummies since our dinner there this evening, to boot.\n\nBeing new to this area, I rely on Yelp reviews, and I thought this might be helpful.  While Elephant Bar might be great in some other areas, the Chandler location is a big AVOID in my books.  Especially when Chandler has at least 10 other great restaurants within walking distance of this EB."
1,"Beautiful non-gambling hotel attached to the MGM. We stay here twice a year for 8-11 days. And that for the past few years. So, I dare to say we're regular guests. That means that we also see the changes over the years. And those are not always for the better......\n\nIn this review I only commend the general amenities like the pool, the reception, the overall premises and the valet. We almost alway book the room through Luxury Suites International so you'll find the review of the room and the roomservice there.\n\nHaving said that. Let's review The Signature. In the past we've stayed in Tower 2 and 3, but the last years we always request Tower 1. It's nearer to the MGM (and believe, it's quit a walk) and the pool has better sun hours. Almost all day long you can have a spot in the sun. So you wish......\n\nBut, I don't alway want to sit in the sun. I prefer a parasol because my skin is definitely not used to over 100F. And that seems to be a problem in the last few years. Every year there are less parasols. I regret that deeply. For me it should be obliged by law to provide (free) parasols I've you offer pool amenities. This is Vegas, this is the dessert! We even had one year (about 3-4 years ago) that you had to pay $30 for a parasol. Luckily that stopped with that ridiculous policy.\n\nSo the pool is the only thing I deduct a star for. Mostly because of the parasol issue and besides that because of the paid chairs and cabanas ($75-$200). Maybe because I'm European that I dislike that, but maybe also because I seldom see anybody use them. Like I said, we're here twice a year. Late may/june and late september/october, during the weeks, the weekends and sometimes a holiday and in all those years last may was the first time I saw a party using a cabana. Loose those things and use the parasols and space for other guests. That would be a really nice gesture.\n\nAnd in the past (like everything) the pool service was better. More, free parasols, free bottles of water and thicker towels.\n\nValet service is excellent. I really like the friendly staff. Fitness facilities are nice. Wifi service depends a little bit on the place you are. But it seems to be better than in the past. And it's a good thing they don't provide free newspapers anymore to all rooms. I believe you can pick up a copy at the front desk. Probably saves a lot of money and trees. All together we would definitely recommend this hotel and I hope to be back in 2014.\n\n(Note: I'm no native speaker so please forgive any spelling and grammar mistakes.)"
1,"I'm in bakery heaven!  There is so much to choose from and it all looks delicious.  I have already been twice and can see it would not be hard for me to become a regular here.  The interior decoration is very inviting and service is great.  They get bonus points for serving such delicious espresso drinks!\nI had their soup and half sandwich combo on my last visit - ham and cheese on focaccia with gazpacho, and it is apparent that quality ingredients are a priority here.  I loved the individual banana cream pie I had for dessert, the interior was light and creamy and the crust was flaky.  I got to try a bite of the strawberry napoleon, and would have been just as pleased with that selection.  \nI am excited to see businesses like this spread out across Vegas and will be sure to do my part to support them."
1,"i love Maxim. from the general mood of the place down to the random Christmas decorations that are never put away, it reminds me of a lot of the Vietnamese restaurants scattered throughout Little Saigon in Southern California, where the owners are originally from. some holidays, they'll take random trips back to visit, so don't be surprised if you roll up and find a handwritten sign saying that they are closed for a few days. the service is always great though, even when lunchtime diners pack the place. \n\ni've been here lots of times but only ever get one dish - the mi (egg noodle soup) but ordered dry style so that the broth comes in a separate bowl. it's something i ate a lot in CA, but have trouble finding in Phoenix. it's not quite what i'm used to, but comes pretty damn close. if you like mi but have never tried it this way, definitely give it a go! \n\nthere are just a few things to watch out for. it's in a small strip mall so you might miss it if you blink. the parking lot can get a bit crowded and making a left turn into the lot is tricky. and for all the Thai tea drinkers out there, we found out they don't sweeten it with coconut here. other than those tiny details, maxim is an awesome place to get a good, inexpensive meal."
1,"Terrific shop!  Clean and neat as could be, friendly owner, and good prices.  All smoke shops should be this good."
1,"The place was so clean, and they had candles burning throughout which was a nice surprise.  I had a pedicure for 25 dollars that was better than some of the spas around PHX for much more money!  I will defiently be back!"
1,"Full disclosure: I was with a group of hot girls. So yeah, we had a great time and didn't have to mess with all of the usual crap that comes with getting into a place like this. We all chipped in to get ourselves a table, and were put up on the second floor close to the bar. It was the perfect spot for a night like this -- not too crowded, and we still had the opportunity to look down and see the masses downstairs on the dance floor. The music was good (which is really the basis for the 4 stars here), our bottle service gal was nice, and we had a blast dancing and hanging out together.\n\nNe-Yo was performing on Saturday night, which was cool too. He took the floor around 1am and sang a few songs. I wouldn't necessarily pay to see him in concert, so this was the perfect setting!"
1,The super seafood combo is soo good:D
0,Euro cafe was pricey and the food was fair. I had the lamb gyro. It was just ok. The cucumber sauce was fair. My wife had the ravioli witch had more cheese then ravioli. Fries were over cooked. Won't eat it again. So far it's the only restaurant I won't return to in downtown Gilbert.  Thumbs down.
0,"Maybe it's because I went on a Thursday with colleagues, but apparently it's R&B night or Jazz night or something.  They play some old school CDs really loud so it's hard to maintain a decent conversation.  On top of that, it's old school CDs bc the music would skip.  We asked them to turn it down (off) and their response was: It's R&B night.  Uh, so who cares? Literally, there was us and 2 old cougars sitting at the bar - that's about it. Note: We were not sitting with these cougars, but the amount of times they were looking over at our table, I thought it was feeding time - feeling like a piece of meat, sheesh!  Hardly a R&B night if you ask me!  Beers were fine, I liked the multitude of screens.  But it's so dead on Thursday bc of Jazz Night!  Just giving them a heads up, let's trash that idea, yeah? :)  \n\nLol, 2 other corporate dudes walked in, was looking around, saw cougars + music skipping and peaced out.  We totally should have done that.\n\ndmo out."
0,The hostess sat us at a table that is designed to expand to the table adjacent to us for larger groups. We sat maybe 20 inches from total strangers with his toddler. Both were quiet but just too close. Made me uncomfortable for the whole duration. Food was quick and I'm a fan of Denny's anyhow (pancakes). The carpet was quite dirty which makes the whole place seem dirty. Just an observation
1,"Delicious pizza by the slice or whole pie - very good all around place. I usually just get a slice of cheese, but yesterday, we got a whole pizza, and it was even good this morning. If you're there, try the Italian ices that they have. Really decent tiramisu as well. Especially for a fast-food place."

0,"Wow, what a horrible experience. So bad that I had to cancel my reservation for my stay on the way back.\n\nI stayed here with my two children for one night in March. We got in kind of late and checked in around 9:30 pm. Check-in was fine. We let the clerk know we needed a ride to the airport in the morning and it turns out that you can leave your car there if you're planning to stay on your return trip and the stay is 14 days or less (I asked after a friend informed me you can do this--beats paying for airport parking!). We were flying to Hawaii and would be gone for 10 days, so this was a good deal.\n\nOur room was on the ground floor and was not nicer than a Motel 6 as far as I remember Motel 6s being from when I was a kid. It was hot and humid in the hotel so I turned on the AC. That clanky piece of crap managed to wake me up every single time it went on during the night. A HORRIBLE night of sleep.\n\nTo make matters worse, there were a bunch of college-aged drunk kids staying in the hotel who showed up around 10:30 pm. They hung out right outside of my door and were up and down the stairs laughing and being obnoxious until 1 am. I typically am not shy about sticking my head out the door and telling people to be quiet, but since I was alone with my kids, I didn't think it was the best idea. I called the front desk around 11 pm and they said their driver (who doubles as security) would drive back there when he returned from the airport, in about 20 minutes. It was not 20 minutes, that's for sure. Considering we had to be up at 5 am, waiting ANY amount of time was infuriating. They should have had someone on the premises who can act in the capacity of a security guard or something. I heard the van drive by around 1 am and that's when the inconsiderate a-holes finally went up to their rooms.\n\nIn the morning (at 5 am) I couldn't help myself and as we were heading to the front desk to catch the shuttle, I knocked loudly on one of the doors of the worst offenders and called them jerks. Passive aggressive, I know, but whatever. In the lobby, while waiting for the shuttle, I heard other guests complaining about the loud jerks, too.\n\nThe shuttle ride was fine; the driver was a nice guy. There was no way in hell, though, I'd be staying there on our way back. I was worried about my car the entire time we were gone and I didn't cancel my reservation until the day we were supposed to leave HI and stay there again. We got into PHX around 10:30 at night and we waited for the shuttle with about 5 other guests who were staying there. Shuttle after shuttle came for other hotels and ours didn't show up until 11:20 pm. I didn't want to draw too much attention to us since we weren't planning to stay so I didn't complain much. When we got to the hotel, I tipped the guy well and we booked it to the back of the hotel to my car. Thankfully, my car was fine and we made the 10-15 minute drive to a much nicer place--the Hilton Garden Inn. That place cost about $80 more and the AC was still not very quiet, but the hotel was quiet and I turned off the AC and surprisingly wasn't hot. Anyway, that's another review.\n\nI will NEVER stay here again. Ever."
1,"I know that people have strong opinions on bagels.  There are New York bagels and Montreal bagels.  There are big bready bagels and smaller chewy bagels, and if you feed one to a fan of the other, you're in for a world of complaining.  But you know what? I don't care, because my formative bagel experiences came at the hands of Bagels Forever.\n\nThe bagels are average-sized and perfectly formed.  You can enjoy one with cream cheese without feeling like you've blown your calories for the day.  There are a range of flavors, but nothing outrageous.  The price is right.  For a brief and glorious time, they were available in a large box in the refrigerator case at Meijer in Champaign, Illinois, where I was attending grad school.  That ceased to be the case, and I've been dreaming of them ever since.\n\nTherein lies the problem with my love for Bagels Forever: scarcity.  I live on the other side of Lake Michigan, and while Zingerman's makes a mean bagel, they're a poor replacement for Bagels Forever."
0,"My boyfrind and I went to the Rio in search of a good dinner. We landed at Cafe Mortorano. We did the special where you get an appitizer, 2 entrees and a dessert for $44 each. We sat down and the waitress took a good 5 minutes to greet us. My boyfriend ordered his drink and I took water until I made my choice. It took her another 10 to 15 minutes to get the drink and to take our order. The food was semi up to par, however our server was horrid. She dropped off our entree's 30 minutes after our appitizer was cleared. She passed by our table several times without even glancing our way. Another server noticed and he was awesome at checking to see if our dinner was up to par.  No matter the food, the service was terrible."
1,"1 word, awesome! \n\nSuper friendly staff and super quick and delicious dumplings! When I come back to madtown, ill remember I like their beef dumplings very much! !!\n\nGreat value for the amount of food as well! Amazing"
0,"Been driving by ever since they started remodeling the old Abacus.  Got the menu in the mail and figured they've had enough time to have their act together so my wife ordered takeout for me to pick up on the way home from work.\n\nThey've opened up the Abacus layout into one large room and added a large sushi bar across from the old drinks bar.  It's well lit but plain, with little decoration.  Only a couple of diners there when I arrived around 6:30 but it still took several minutes of standing at the unattended front desk before anyone helped me, and then a few more to sort out I was there to pick up food.  (Is this a new concept?)\n\nPortions were generous: hot & sour soup, lettuce wraps, chicken salad, orange chicken with white rice were much more than enough for two but we wanted to try several things.  Everything looked fine but ... there's a reason why most points on Iron Chef are given for flavor; it should be the most important element in every dish.  I will say PG was remarkably consistent: every dish was pretty much flavor-free.  Not just not the flavor you might expect from other times you've had the same dish elsewhere, but pretty much no flavor at all.  No seasoning, no spices, no hot, no sour, no citrus, no zing, no interest.  (Oh, except for the little containers of light-brown \u00fcber-wasabi dressing that came with the wraps and salad.  A few seriously intense drops cleaned my sinuses, but otherwise, you guessed it: no flavor.)  Plenty of leftovers remain we can try to rescue with seasoning another night.\n\n I know it's still a new place and maybe there's kinks to work out.  We'll go back some time to give them a second try, but only on the principle that one data point doesn't establish a trend.  If results are the same I'd much rather wait an hour at Sakana just down the street.  Good luck Pacific Garden, you'll need it."

It is a TOTALLY unprofessional business environment with male members of the call center sales team making BLATANT lude and sexual comments.\n\nAs a result, a formal complaint has been made with the EEO."
0,"I wanted to take my grandma out for some dinner and since this place is a block or so from her house, we decided to give it a try. \n\nUpon arriving we could tell that it was busy, but there were still empty tables. We waited for 5 to 10 minutes to be seated and then another few for our waitress to take our drink orders (water, nothing from the bar). At this point I should have taken better notice of the patrons around us. Nobody had food in front of them and several tables looked anxious as if they had been waiting for some time. Our waitress returned to take our orders and then we started what would be the longest wait in restaurant history...\n\nWe literally waited for 35 minutes from the time we placed our order to the time we received our dinner salads. 'Oh good sign' I thought as we received our salads, thinking dinner couldn't be too far behind... well I was wrong. We sat and sat and sat for another 25 minutes. Eventually I told my hard of hearing grandma that I was going to settle up on our waters and side salads and we would go grab some Arby's. She agreed and I hunted down our waitress. When I told her I wanted to tab out, she looked at me with disbelief and stated she would have to get the manager. Then she proceeded to clean a table. I was disgusted and ready to go. And I would have too, if my sweet little grandma wasn't sitting there. Our waitress returned and asked if we could wait 2 more minutes. I looked around and mentioned there were at least 2 other tables ahead of us. She stated that they ordered pizza and it takes longer than our orders. A few more minutes passed and our plates came out. \n\nThe food was nothing fancy, but did taste alright. I had stuffed shells and grandma had manicotti. \n\nNext time I take grandma to dinner we will make the drive to another place and avoid the excessive waits."
0,"First impression walking into this Baskin-Robbins was that they seriously needed to mop their floors. Seriously, it was THAT disgusting! The teenagers working seemed less than thrilled to have customers. The ice-cream is the only thing that gets a star here. This place needs better employees and better management!!"
1,"A very authentic Sri Lankan restaurant, place is clean and tidy, food is so good.\nThe restaurant did well in asian-type cooking, Sri Lankan, Indian, Japanese and few Chinese dishes."
1,"Thank you Yelp for helping me find this gem! I was browsing through Yelp and they had a deal $10 for $20. The reviews were good, so I bought the deal. I am glad I did. I have been to Thailand and love Thai food. This place had Kana (Chinese broccoli), it wasn't listed as a side, but I requested a plate of it and they delivered. It was good. \nThe best part of the meal was the Tom Yum Kai. It was like what I had when visiting Thailand. The lemongrass really shined in this soup. I loved it.\nThis establishment offers Issan style food, which is a great benefit and sometimes hard to find. Duck is all over the menu, which is a bonus as well. \nEverything we had was delicious and we will definitely be back."
1,"Truly caring doctor who is concerned about your personal needs, I find this hard to find now. Have no doubt in my mind that I would go anywhere else, great practice and amazing doctor!"
1,"My friend and I stopped by this spot with a Groupon late on a Saturday evening, just before closing. We tried the pulled pork pizza with a couple of pints. Two words: AWESOME SAUCE! \n\nThe pizza had unforgettable flavor, combining sweet, savory, and acidic into a delicious bite. Also, the staff was more than accommodating-they gave us remarkable service in spite of our lateness. Most definitely worth the ten bucks we paid for the groupon-even worth the sticker price."
0,"ANOTHER BIG TIME FAIL FROM MY YELP COMMUNITY!!\n\nCraving some serious breakfast after a long night of partying. I had already bookmarked this restaurant prior to my Las Vegas Trip based on the stellar reviews. We ventured away from the strip to this restaurant located in an industrial area inside a small strip mall don't flinch you might miss it. \n\nMy wife and I arrived at 1pm., placed our name on the wait list, Very friendly gentlemen greets us and tells us there is a 25min. wait. I says no problem. We were seated within the time frame, our waitress takes our order right away as we were starving. I usually stop at Starbucks to get a coffee when eating at most breakfast spots as the coffee tends to be weak but I overlooked my instincts lazily and decided to try theirs. Well unsurprisingly the Coffee was super weak. As soon as I added creamer it turned milky instantly. My Bad $2.50.\n\nFood/Prices- I opted for the DENVER OMELETTE with home fries and Toast Price was decent under $9. I asked the waitress if I can sub bacon for the ham that comes with the denver she said no problem.  Our order took a little while to come out. The presentation looked great big portion for sure; better than it tasted. My OMELETTE- TOTAL grease pit, they used tons of oil to cook it, plus the cheese stuffed inside was your poor quality cheese used at most LA style burger joints that increased the greasiness further. First couple bites were very mushy eggs were not cooked that well, upon further inspection I also noticed very little bacon in my omelette so I began to open it up and noticed they didnt even cook the bacon at all prior to stuffing it in my omelette. The potatoes were the only thing that came out good they were hot and crispy. I couldnt finish it even though I was starving i did enjoy the potatoes but was very dissapointed. \n\nMy wife ordered the French toast special, served with Eggs and Bacons under $9. Her eggs also cooked with tons of oil, bacon was good. The French toast that everyone raves about was weak yo. First of all it was served cold, next it had no flavor you couldnt add enough syrup to give it flavor. No moistness, no tastes of eggs or cinnamon ever touching the bread. Maybe they dipped the texas toast in milk and pan fried not sure. Was a total fail. \n\nWaitress came by asked us how our food was, I told her I was disappointed with the french toast coming out so cold. She opted to warm it up for us but by this time I was completely disillusioned with my meal. I decided to pay, leave and will not come back. \n\nPrices are Good; Portions are Big, Service Is Good, However, I prefer quality over quantity food was not on point. Sorry Yelpers this was a fail dont do it! Should have tried the breakfast spot at my hotel not worth the hassle of leaving the Strip."
1,"Dropped by for dinner before heading upstairs to the club portion of the establishment.\n\nWe ordered waaaaayyy too much food, which was fine by me since it was my last night in Vegas on this trip.  Might as well go out with a bang right? \n\nAnyways, some highlights of the meal included the following:\n\n-Spicy tuna on crispy rice\n-Lobster wontons\n-Sea bass skewers\n-Toro sashimi\n-Salmon sashimi\n-Mini donuts for desert\n\nThe thing that amazed me about this place is that the food is worth eating.  The dining room is a scene AND it is enormous.  It is quite a feat that the kitchen is able to keep up with the dining room considering how large it is.  And given the people watching here, some restaurants might try to get away with the fact that their dining room is filled with a large number of scantily clad women.  Tao avoids that trap and serves up some pretty tasty Asian dishes and has the service to see that it gets served right."
0,"Ok my friends stayed here while we stayed raw at the Imperial palace, but I spent a lot of time here.   Casino was ok, with decent tables but relatively high minimums.  Some dealers were really mean, and it seemed I got IDed at every table.  The pool area is nice.\n\nWent to LAX, and it was ok.  Basically a DJ playing all mashup music, but too mashed up and too random.  Friend almost got thrown out for dropping a drink on the floor.   The club tries to look all exclusive with velvet ropes, and long line, but it is really not, you can just walk through the bridge from mandalay and get free passes in even if you are a group of guys.  A girl with us got on the \""guest list\"" and we all got in that way too.  Anyhow, the door here is not tough.  Drinks are roughly $10 in the club.  Not a bad place.\n\nThe rooms were not very impressive.  They paid 5x as much as us, and their room was hot and rank, while ours was frosty cold.  the beds sucked too."
1,"I recently discovered this place and I really like it. I ordered the turkey sandwich which comes with cheese,avocado ...etc on walnut cranberry bread. Needless to say I've been back three times since and ordered the same thing. The only thing they they may want to work on is getting the food out faster. I personally don't mind the wait time but a few other people I recommended it to told me they had to wait quite a while for their to-go orders. I say, worth the wait! Yummy! I hope they eventually expand the menu and have more salad options like chinese chicken salad...etc. It makes sense to add more low carb options to the menu since they're located in the same plaza as Gold's gym. \n\nAnyway.....yum, yum, yum! Go and try it for yourself!"
0,"Being from new jersey (and having the possessive attitude over Italian food that comes with my drivers license from thy part of the country), I was worried about eating Italian in Phoenix.  The antipasta was actually really good.  The mozzarella and prosciutto were fresh and tasty.  But only 1 1/2 of the 6 people I went out with enjoyed their entree, mostly pasta dishes that were too bland and sauceless.  The desserts were tasty.  The service was polite but slow.  I'm usually pretty forgiving but this place was not great."
0,"I know it would be wrongheaded to expect a great burrito from a bar and maybe I should not have ordered it.  The burrito was not good.  It was more of a vegetable wrap.  My date didn't take the burrito detour and ordered a wrap directly.  It was a lonely little thing in a plastic basket.  She described it as \""good, not great.\""  But these facts alone do not earn this restaurants two stars.  Mortimer's gets this rating because they served dinner, on a Friday night, with plastic silverware.  No points awarded for how amazingly close an approximation to real, shiny silverware these plastic forks and knives provided.  \n\nThe food quality, the cramped quarters, and yes, the plastic silverware all gave me the impression that I was dining on an airplane."
1,"A---MAZING.\n\nGod how I love mussels and fries. \nHuge order of 1.5 lbs mussels with WHITE SAUCE! And the twice fried fries... wow. Yum. I swear, visiting my sister in Pittsburgh... its just an excuse to come here. \n\nThe great warm flaky crusted bread that comes with it totally makes my annual trip to Pittsburgh.\n\nTheir beer selection is great.\n\nTheir pork chop was hearty, good solid food. \n\nBut omg, ask what their specials are each day, I had this AWESOME steak, it was blow-you-away awesome. With savory jalepeno mashed potatoes, omg that special was amazing. \n\n**note. Whenever you go, try to do an early dinner, the crowd gets thick past 6 and the wait is excruciating. Save yourself the pain of having to smell wonderful food and wondering when the hell you're gonna be seated by going early, or late."
0,Very bad service with low-quality food for an unnecessary amount of money.
1,"Talk about delicious bagels, I went in to grab a quick bagel with my buddy and walked out with a bakers dozen!  I did have lunch 2-3 times on different occasions, and their broccoli/cheddar soup rocked, it was very broccoli-ey and cheese-y.  The sandwiches can pass for borderline gourmet (pesto, good selection of cheeses and fresh baked artisan breads) \n\nBut lets talk about the cinnamon crunch bagel that Im obsessed with.  I got it lightly toasted and cream cheese on the side.  It was fresh, hot and so good!  I couldnt bear to adulterate the flavor with the cr. cheese, so I just got some butter and enjoyed it with hot tea with honey.  You would love it too :)  And yes, it has free wi-fi so dont forget to get your laptop or your choice entertainment."
0,All I have to say is not good it was better off being a Starbucks. The waitresses was rude there. The place smelled really bad. The cook was nasty. To pizza taste like a frozen dinner. Didn't want to leave a reading it doesn't even deserve one start. But it will not let me post it without rating.
1,"There are a few things that bum me out about Willaby's. \n1. They recently adjusted their hours and I won't be able to wander in there at 1am this Saturday. \n2. The wait seems like forever. It probably only took twenty minutes for our food to arrive this Saturday, but it felt like an eternity. \n3. I hate smelling like a hash brown. You leave and you smell like breakfast all day. \n\nI'm willing to look past these things because the food is mmm, mmm good. Butter. Lots of butter. And cheese, lots of cheese. I opted for something without much of either (eggs/toast/hash) and really dug my meal and didn't mind that it was under 7 bucks either! I hear when they're busy, plan to wait even longer for food, but it's totes worth the wait. The place is classic. Solid in every way. Though they can probs benefit from another cook because one person has a hard time plating a restaurant's worth of food. If you're a coffee drinker, they fill up pretty fun mugs with java. Get one! Snap a pic and post it like Tom Q!"
0,"I'm just following up on my previous review. Through the recommendation of my new Vet, I did opt to have an ultra sound (more detailed and less invasive, procedure than biopsy) performed, and discovered the dog had a sever infection of the prostate. The prostate had enlarged to twice the normal size. The infection was actually located on the outside of the prostate and could have spread and possibly killed the dog.  I'm glad I didn't take Dr. Anderson's advice not to perform the biopsy (or similar test). It took immediate surgery and three weeks of antibiotics , but my dog it doing much better. The cost was less than I had expected. I'm glad I didn't  waste any more time waiting for Dr. Anderson to return my  phone calls and recommend treatment. I feel stupid for even waiting that long, but like many people noted on their reviews they trust Dr. Anderson. I was no different, so I waited. I'm happy with my new vet, but sadly disappointed in my previous one."
1,"They always have pretty good food, and even when they're busy, the wait isn't too long to get seated. The staff is always nice."
1,"Been there two times now and I have been pretty satisfied with the food.  The whole grilling at the table is pretty fun and all the tapas are diverse which gives a intersting variety to the menu.  The only thing is that I wish they had more of a happy hour at the bar but I will let it slide because my friends and I were in there at about 1am and the chef bought us all shots!\n\nI am glad my friends convinced me to try out a new restaurant because I have not always had the best experiences with new establishments.   The outside of the building does not give the inside justice either, it is rather nice inside!  Give it a shot!"
1,Awesome place just moved to phoenix from Los Angeles and I must say I was not disappointed
1,"First time eating this type of Japanese food and it was great!  The food was fresh and the service was excellent.  We flew into Vegas for a business trip and my wife wanted to eat here.  It was simply a great experience.  When we were eating, we talked to a bunch of locals and they too raved about how great the place is.  I definitely recommend this place for Japanese tapas!"
1,I am definitely a huge fan of this place! The ramen is amazing! I actually love everything on this menu! Just wish they have bigger parking lot! Or at least at a better location!
0,"An sich guter Eindruck, Verkaufspersonal freundlich und z\u00fcgig.\nAber einen \""gro\u00dfen\"" D\u00f6ner zu verkaufen, der eher einem Kinderd\u00f6ner entspricht ist dreist. Wie klein ist dann der normale?"
1,went here awhile back.\nthe one thing i remember though is really good food:)
1,"Great dentistry family! Everyone cares about the health of your mouth. I switched to desert dentistry because I felt like I was being \""farmed\"" at my previous dentist. Not so here. Once I had a question about some work they had done. They had me in the next day to resolve it. And it turned out it was work done by my previous dentist. I still don't like novacaine shots."
0,"This place is such a waste of space, it's an absurdly overpriced dump.  Seriously I've been given the wrong sandwich all but 1 time I've been here and that time there was hair in the sandwich.  I only go here because I'm with someone who wants to eat here, I've never chosen this restaurant out of complete freedom of choice.  I can't say enough horrible this about this place save for the usual which is at bad as this place is there is worse out there."
1,"I have previously mentioned my love for Mexican food so I have been to this restaurant more times then I care to share but I am just now getting around to writing about it!\n\nIn MY opinion, this is the best Mexican restaurant I have been to in terms of authenticity.  I know there are a lot of trendy mexican-fusion type joints but this is just your old fashioned get your grub on type Mexican.\n\n\nThe GOOD:  The salsa is very good...fresh ingredients give it a little bit of chunk and the flavor is perfect.  It is a little runny but I don't like salsa that has been thickened by paste or because it was pureed.  I would rather the flavor with chunks of onion and pieces of cilantro--and that is what this place offers.  \n\n\nThe BAD--They serve the salsa in a very small dish and they have a disclaimer on the menu that indicates only the first two rounds of chips and salsa are free.  I mean, what?  I understand we are in a tough economic situation but you can't be a mexican restaurant and charge for chips and salsa.  We have managed to avoid that extra charge so far.  We usually just ask a different person for more salsa every time...I know, a little dishonest, but I can't help it!  I expect a charge when you go to some random place and happen to order chips and salsa as your appetizer (like Chili's or something) but any standard, hole-in-the-wall Mexican place should NOT do such a thing.\n\n\n\nTHE EXCELLENT:  Their fresh, tableside guacamole!  WOW!  I had no idea avocados could have so much flavor.  It was fantastic.  The flavors were bold and boasted of fresh cilantro, onion, and lime!  It was such a perfect combination of flavors.  I have had it with the jalapenos and without...either way was incredible!  \n\n\n\nI typically get the veggie fajitas and that is another reason why I love this place.  TYPICALLY, if I order veggie fajitas I end up with onions and peppers marinated in salt.  Azteca sends out grilled onions, peppers, tomatoes, squash, broccoli and mushrooms.  They are not weighted down with sodium and dripping in a fajita sauce....they are grilled and fresh.  It really is perfectly done!\n\n\n\nThe beans and rice and pretty basic--nothing to speak about.  The flour tortillas are great and their pico de gallo is fresh and flavorful.\n\n\nOne other downfall is that they don't give you the option for black beans on the side.  But, what I found out is that black beans are not as authentic in terms of Mexican food.  Muy interesante!\n\n\n\nIt is definitely worth checking them out...even if it is just for their guacamole.  You may want to bring your own jar of salsa though....just kidding"
0,"Circa 2002, I was pretty obsessed with Serendipity -- ya know, the romantic comedy with John Cusak and Kate Beckinsale.  There was that one scene where they were sharing that amazing looking frozen hot chocolate.  Because of that, I always vowed that I would make it to Serendipity in NYC and try the hot chocolate myself.  \n\nHowever, as many times as I visited NYC, i NEVER made it to Serendipity.  So, on this last trip to Vegas, my girlfriends and I made it a point to put it on our to-do list to make it there.\n\nWe fulfilled this goal right away as we made Serendipity our first food stop in Vegas.  The inside is cute and old-school ice cream fountain like, but we sat outside on their large patio.  Serendipity has a great location (in front of Cessar's on the Strip), but that's about all it has going for it.  Granted, it's the Strip, but their food is ridiculously overpriced (entrees AND ice cream).  I get that the ice cream portions are huge, but $15 for dessert?!  C'mon now people.  The experience was pretty underwhelming, to be honest.\n\nMy tip?  Check your hotel for coupons!  We, sadly, saw coupons for a free frozen hot chocolate in one of the coupon booklets once we got back to the hotel.  Save yourself $10!"
0,"This store SUCKS! DO NOT GO HERE!\n\nIn the last month, we have walked in, and immediately walked out as the NEVER have bagels.  There were 4 kinds there today, if that.  I actually had to ask if they made bagels there.  The customer service sucks even more than the selection.  I have almost jumped over the counter on a few occasions.\n\nWe keep going there like idiots, and end up having to go to a different EB on Val Vista.  That one is GREAT!\n\nWhen we went into the Val Vista one today, we talked about how horrible the other store is, and almost every employee has said that they hear about how bad the Gilbert store is all the time.  Then, another customer overheard us and she said she lives right next to the Gilbert store and still has to drive to Val Vista one because of how bad this one is.  She mentioned that she even complained to a Regional Manager.  so she was nice enough to give me his info.\n\nBOTTOM LINE.  If you like Einstein's Bagels, DO NOT GO TO THIS STORE.  They say they make bagels, but they don't.  The employees are rude, inconsiderate and could care less what you think.\n\nDO NOT GO HERE!"
1,"Two years later, and Social House is still one of the best places to have Japanese on the strip.  Amazing customer service, delicious food, reasonably priced, and great atmosphere.  Still in my top 5 of places to eat when in Las Vegas."
1,"I have a strict \""no spending money in Mesa\"" policy. (I avoid Mesa the same way I avoid nests of black widows, but that's a separate issue.) I admit that there are a FEW places in Mesa, and I mean a FEW, where I will spend my money. Red White and Brew is one of those few locations. \n\nMesa doesn't have many restaurants like this, especially not in north east Mesa. The floor plan is open, airy, well lit and feels roomy to me, even when the place is jam packed. I like the d\u00e9cor, it feels urban and modern. They bring to the table little buttery garlic bread things, which are good but filling. I have to have one and stop. I'm still impressed with their delicious barbeque chicken pizza and it's my default choice if I can't decide on anything else. I have tried a number of other dishes: pasta, steak, fish, salads and have enjoyed every one. The portion sizes are pretty damn enormous and I find it best to share with someone. The dessert menu is always a temptation as well. \n\nThey have a nice wine bar and I like their selection of draft beer. (In the winter, they sometimes carry Pumpkin Porter from Four Peaks. It's a seasonal favorite and if I wasn't so paranoid about calories, I'd drink it all the time.)\n\nI've never had an unpleasant experience with the staff. They have always been friendly, helpful, and professional. \n\nThe last time I checked, they don't take reservations, which makes going with a group a bit difficult. Depending on the time of day and the day of the week, the wait to get in can take a while. I hate waiting (especially to eat at a place in Mesa!) but Red White and Brew is usually worth it."
0,So sad to see another business go under. I went yesterday to get my car washed and after filling with gas and waiting for the attendant to start the wash I went to find out what the holdup was. I was then told the car wash was closed as they had been bought out by the bank. No signs anywhere to show car wash was closed. So sad.
0,"Not impressed.  There are so many great burger places in Vegas, this unfortunately is not one of them.  We sat at our table for 10-15 minutes before being acknowledeged.  The menu is basically a la carte and completley overpriced even for Vegas standards. If you want a plain burger, fries, and a drink its almost 20 bucks.  The food took forever despite the restaurant only being half full and about 8-10 guys working in the exposed kitchen.  Told our server if she could put a rush in the order that would be great considering we had to catch a show and we had already waited insanely long, she gave me attitude and said everything is made to order so theres nothing she can do, rather than just saying \""ok sir\"" to shut me up, which I would have preferred.  She then said she was leaving cause her shift was over and someone else would take care of us (no problem).  He checked on us once, and gave us the bill.  There are a lot better options for a place to eat and I suggest finding one of them (unfortunately mirage really does not have that great of options)."

0,"Everytime I walk into this place and see the guy with the with the glasses & a condescending  look on his face I want to walk OUT! I've given him 5 chances to be a decent human being and just take my order and keep his complaining, cocky remarks to himself.  EVERY time he fails. He acts like I'm inconveniencing him and gives me an IDGAF attitude. Get this waste of space away from your customers Pancheros or you're gonna lose business! P.s FOOD IS GREAT!"
1,"They have one of the best breakfasts in Pittsburgh. I have never had anything bad here. Great meat products, just don't get the sausage patties. They are not of high quality, but everything else is. French Toast is excellent. Pancakes are good, but are really sweet like a donut. You have to be in the mood for them. Like I said they are very sweet. Only negative of this place is the restaurant is small and crammed, it is always packed, and there is always a wait."
1,Woo hoo I agree!  So convenient..I go on my lunch hour and don't have to book weeks ahead of time or worry about trying to schedule after work.  Yvonne is great!!
0,"Eh.\n\nIt was loud because of a live band....but completely empty at 11:30 PM on a Friday night.  I guess everyone was out and about in Vegas...but this place just wasn't that great.\n\nWorse, the promoter at the door gave our very large group cards for \""Buy 1 Get 1 Free.\""  So hey, why not, right?   But then come to find out, each drink costs between $9.50 and $11.00.  So....I get that you're in Vegas and you'll pay, one way or the other, but that seemed just a little outrageous.\n\nI slipped away after only fifteen minutes of watching a couple of old people dance to a cover of Footloose that the live band was playing and that was enough for me.  Thanks."
0,"This review is for the casino only. Yuck. As another reviewer said, this place is dirty. The machines had greasy fingerprints, the chairs had stains and cigarette burns. The ceilings were very low too so the smoke seemed to just linger. OK, do casinos attract the greatest of folks? No, but the crowd at Harrah's seemed extra scary. The next time I'm in LV, I'll be skipping this place."
1,Awesome subway!!!!!
0,"Was a fan until a bad experience. Attempted to call in an order for pick up, no answer. Placed order through drive thru. Was told that they're out of rice. Really? Mexican restaurant out of rice? Got home to find out that my order was incomplete (they forgot to include order of french fries), one of the combos was ordered no lettuce (lettuce was not held), and the side of nachos were old, stale, and cold.\n\nWill not risk this place again."
0,"Being unfamiliar with this area of town, I decided to try this bakery after reading the great reviews. There were so many delicious looking treats to choose from that we had a hard time deciding. However, I am giving this business only two stars because the employees seemed annoyed to have us there (not just one, but all three of them were not friendly at all). I wouldn't say they were rude exactly, but I would describe their demeanor as very unfriendly. It was very odd because I'm used to bakery employees being very happy and upbeat. I felt very unwelcome. Even though the cookies, donut, and cheesecake we bought were delicious, I probably won't try this bakery again due to the poor service. There are plenty of other bakeries in town with equally delicious treats that offer far superior service."
0,"This is the worst company ever. Believe me, you will regret it if you get stuck in a contract with them. They make it impossible to cancel, they demand $$$ from you, and they are rude on top of that. I have never been so irritated about a company. I am taking every possible route to get my word out there. DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME AND MONEY ON THIS AWFUL COMPANY."
1,"The only downside for me is how pricey it is. But I love teppanyaki and this is really the only good one around. My husband and I have been here a few times and always leave very satisfied. The food is incredible. I love the soup, salad, garlic fried rice, steak, veggies, and complementary shrimp that come with it. So good! The chefs are always so entertaining and different each time. I also had their 'Benihana Punch' (alcoholic fruity drink) and it was really good! We went on my birthday this last time and they always give you an ice cream dessert and take a picture of you and your family which they print out and give back to you. Such great service. Totally worth the money but wish it was cheaper so I could go more often!"
1,The food was amazing and our server Charlan was outstanding! I've been longing to eat here and it was well worth the wait...
1,"I couldn't agree more with the opening line of Sandy N.'s review of Border Grill:  This restaurant IS \""a must when visiting Las Vegas.\""\n\nEver since my first visit to this location in Mandalay Bay in '05, I've made sure to visit every chance I have when I'm in Vegas.  Located in the restaurant wing of Mandalay Bay, it's definitely a trek to get here, but totally worth the trip (if you get to the Shark Reef you've walked too far.)\n\nI would recommend making reservations, but it's not necessary.  Upon our arrival, the hostess was very friendly, polite, as well as courteous, and promptly showed us to our table.  After having 1-2 minutes to briefly look over the menu, our server arrived at our table greeting us, and asked for our drink orders.  Well, as you might have guessed there are a fair selection of drinks with Mexican/Spanish roots on the menu, but my friend and I choose a drink special that evening:  the Cranberry mojito.  Priced at a Vegas-reasonable $9.00, it was a definitely a cool and refreshing start to our meal.\n\nTo start, we ordered the fresh house guacamole.  YOU MUST order the guacamole should you choose to dine here.  Not ordering the guacamole would be a travesty on your part.  It would be something like vacationing in Vegas but NOT gambling.  Ok enough said.  I should mention that there are complimentary chips and salsa with your meal as well.  The chips come with 3 types of salsa:  roasted pablano, tomatillo, & red jalape\u00f1o.  In addition to our guacamole, we decided to split a chicken empanadas from the appetizer menu.  This was served with pumpkin mole` and apple salad.  So delicious and just wonderful overall.\n\nFor dinner, I decided to order the chicken enchiladas, while my friend decided on a special for that evening, the turkey rienos with mole sauce.  I would have to admit that after sampling my friend's food, I would say I liked his much better than mine.  Don't get me wrong, my chicken enchiladas were delicious, a great dish overall.  It's just that I thought my friend's dish was well.....just better.  Needless to say, we both were very satisfied with our food and finished every single morsel on the plate, even most of the sauce was gone.  Just vanished.  2 dinner entrees and 2 cranberry mojitos later, we were 2 satisfied but stuffed customers!  \n\nSERVICE:  Terrific.  Wonderful.  Phenomenal.  Excellent.  I could think of more adjectives but I think you get the picture.  The service was some of the best I've ever experienced in Vegas...ever.  Our server was just so \""on it\"" the entire evening.  And when we mentioned that this wasn't our first time dining here, she said something to the effect of thanking us for choosing to dine here again.  After a wonderful meal, she provided us with a complimentary sorbet for dessert.  Now THAT was the icing on the cake.  Fantastic service.\n\nBottom Line:  Make sure to head to Border Grill to experience some of the best Mexican food and customer service Vegas has to offer.  You won't be disappointed."
0,Nothing special about this place. The food is ok. The service was terrible. They do have a few good beers on tap but nothing so great that I will go back.\n\nAnd now upon reviewing our Amex statement we were over charged for our meal. A very disappointing experience all together!
0,"Went here Saturday evening around 6pm. Only 3 other tables seated.  Took 5 minutes to seat us, and then they tried to stick us at the two person low top tables by the bathroom hallway.  Eww.  We switched to a 4 top bar table and they put us at the only one without silverware in the whole restaurant. We ordered our drinks and an appetizer. Very slow to get the appetizer and when they brought it out we still had no silverware. We asked for some and they brought a fork and some paper napkins, even though every table has red linen napkins with silverware inside. By the time we got the silverware the appetizer was cold. We then placed our dinner order, and with that you always get soup and a small salad.  The soup was lukewarm at best, and the salad had approximately a half cup of dressing still in the bowl after I fished out the lettuce pieces.  Gross. Our dinner food again took a long time to arrive.  Our waitress never checked on us, never asked if we wanted more drinks, and we had to ask for our check.  We won't be back."
1,OMG this place is so great!  I have come here a few times on my business trips and make it a point to come here.  Their pineapple shrimp with coconut rice was just a sin!  There dumplings were pretty good too!  Def a place to check out!
0,"The idea is nice, that profit from operations will be used to help those in need. But the food is far under par. We tried the deviled eggs, which were similar to what you might expect if you bought them from the Food Lion deli counter. They were out of the ham and swiss sandwich, so I ordered the turkey club. It had absolutely no flavor. Quite astonishing, actually. How do you make a sandwich with turkey, bacon, and mayo, and yet it be completely bland. My wife had a \""meat and 3\"", fried chicken. The collards were good because of the smoked ham. But otherwise everything was average at best. Portions of the sides were very small. Even though the food was relatively cheap, it still wasn't worth it. I feel sorry for people who live in Charlotte if this is one of the better places downtown. 3/23/12"
0,"Used Yelp to try to find a place to get a breakfast sandwich on our walk up to Edinburgh Castle and Hula looked the most promising. As much as I'd like to support local businesses, I wish we had just gone to Starbucks. I got a bagel with cream cheese and my husband got a ham/cheese bagel. They were fine, but so overpriced. For the same amount of money we could have gotten breakfast sandwiches with better stuff in them (like actual eggs!) from Starbucks."
1,"Five stars for Cafe Boa being one of the very few places in Phoenix that caries Slovenian and Croatian wines, on top of having a very impressive wine list.  Vipava Valley, Karst, Podravje, and Croatian island varietals can all be found on the menu.  Five stars for not having ubiquitous Californian blends with no history.  And the food, the service (sit at the bar), and the decor is top notch too."
0,"If their bialis get much smaller, THEY WILL BE INVISIBLE!!! My husband and I have been shopping at this A.J.'s for bialis for a number of years and WE ARE DONE. Their bialis keep getting smaller and smaller. This morning my husband purchased two of them and they were MINISCULE. So, from now on, we will be buying our Bialis at either Chompies or Bagels and Bialis."
0,I was hoping for a good mexican meal but instead went to Los Olivos!  The ambience was ok; the food bad.
0,"I freaking love this place.  I live clear across town and drive all the way here for thier garlic knots and Calzones.  Always.  Idk what happened tho... Today they came out rock hard, no butter. Terrible.  I asked for a new one and they came out less hard but still ridiculous.  My calzone was burnt.  What happened guys?  So devastating.  New kitchen guy?  :("
0,"I am giving Olive & Ivy only 1 star because the employees have no idea how to run a restaurant or deal with customers.  We went there to celebrate a Birthday which did not go too well.  First when we made the reservation we were told to come in before 3pm on a Sunday so we could order from 3 menus well when we arrived, we were told a different story about the menus and told something else by another person and the story kept changing depending on who you spoke with.  Well this restaurant should be closed between 3-5pm on weekends as the only items are flatbreads, a select few salads and apps but no one tells you this when you call.  So we had planned to order dinner but were told we could not something to do with the kitchen, but we were also told we could not order from the brunch or lunch menu either so we were stuck as to what to order, well it was terrible - the flat breads were terrible, dry and way to salty. The bacon burger was not worth $12.00 and it was just a real bad time and the manager would not comp anything for all the bad information and did not seem to care we could not find anything good to eat on the menu.  We had told the waitress we could not handle anything spicy as to let us know if we ordered something which was spicy well do not order the hummus, we were not told it had jalapenos in it even though we asked, they did not take it off the bill even though 5 of the 6 people at the table did not eat it.  We will not visit again, very bad experience, bad manager, bad customer service.  not a good fox restaurant, plus the uniforms looked like construction workers.  The food, was well not worth the money and have had much better elsewhere."
0,"Older casino, away from the heart of the strip. Smell of cigarette smoke infused into the main casino floor. Shopping area is very small compared to what you find at Caesar's or Mandalay Bay. Only thing I liked about this casino is KJ Kitchen (dim sum restaurant). With so many other casinos to choose from I would never stay at the Rio."
1,"I visited Ground Control about a year ago for some tea and conversation. Since then, I've told my husband, \""Hey, we should go there together.\"" That finally came about--and now we can't wait to go back!\n\nThis was part of a night on indulgence. We were here for drinks and dessert, though a number of things on the regular food menu look good, too. I had a chocolate strawberry martini and it was GOOD. It even looked pretty. My husband had the beer sampler and enjoyed several immensely. He was happy to buy a growler to bring home.\n\nThen there was dessert. Oh my. First of all, I was able to go up and sample several kinds of gelato. The selection is really amazing. We then had stracciatella atop the half-baked chocolate chip cookie. This cookie was the size of a frisbee! It's thin, sure, but oh my goodness it was rich and delicious. I was ready to explode by the time we were done, but wow, what a dessert.\n\nOh yes, we will return."
1,Pay the extra for the VIP seats. We sat in the fourth row and had that up close experience. You also get the programs for free with the VIP. The drinks are expensive but good and they come in a P&T cup. The show is not for those wanting cheap and cheesy Las Vegas magic. The show is intelligent with a touch of politics and social commentary added in. Getting photos and autographs after is amazing.
0,"I landed in vegas late on a Thursday night and found the line from hell at the Thrifty rental counter.  I had two birthdays waiting to be served.  I would rather pay more money and go somewhere else than stand in a line as long as I did.  Honestly, it took and hour and twenty minutes to helped."
0,"I had high hopes for this hole in the wall restaurant...well, here it goes. I walked in and the counter attendant immediately started talking to me in Spanish. Likewise for the waitress. Just cuz I'm brown doesn't mean I hablo Espa\u00f1ol!  :/  If you can't tell that's a pet peeve of mine.\n\nAnyways, I decided to get my order to-go. I ordered two pupusas. When it was ready, I whipped out my debit card. I was given a dirty look. She asked (less than politely) \""you don't have $3.80 cash?\"". Uh no- that's why I have a card in my hand. \""Our card machine is broken\"" she says. Mind you,  there wasn't anything posted alerting customers to this problem. I asked if there was an ATM nearby. I didn't understand her reply. So we just stared at each other awkardly until I apologized and left.  \n\nI didn't get a chance to try the food,  but the rude employees and unannounced broken card/debit machine will keep me from coming back. I say again, epic failure!"
1,One of the perks at staying at the Palms is getting comp'd for many of our food. So we decide to try their buffet which was Bistro. The prime rib was cooked a medium well so it wasn't too bad but not great. It wasn't too tough to chew and it did have tons of flavor.. maybe because I put tons of aui ju and salt. =) Their sushi selection wasn't great but the ones they had were tasty. I felt they could have put more sushi in stead of having the roll be 85% rice. The snow crab legs were great...very sweet and easy to open. Their desert area was pretty good. Their eclairs were good especially with the ice cream. Our server was fast and refilled our drinks constantly.
1,The all you can eat lunch is gone!  But the quality of the lunch experience isn't diminished 1 bit.

0,"blah blah blah- Crazy Horse this- Crazy Horse that. \ni seriously think this place has gone completely downhill. \ni've been coming here since 2004- and every time i've been back.. the girls look worse and worse. it's turning into Cheetahs! ewwwww! \n\ni know most strip clubs have a certain \""stench\"" (yup, they do!)- \nbut this one really takes the cake. the smell of bleach, cologne and piss.. sexy! \n\nthe girls really know how to hustle- but it was getting a little desperate. we spent 40 mins in there and raced to the next strip joint."
1,"My husband and I decided to give this place a try even though it was a little far from our house and we were glad we did! The food was great and it's not expensive at all! I don't know who would call this restaurant overpriced, it's cheaper than Olive Garden and the food is waaaay better. \n\nWe got Chicken 65 for an appetizer and were pleasantly surprised. It was a good amount of food for an appetizer and the chicken was really yummy, spicy but with lots of flavor. Then, I got Korma chicken and asked them if they could combine chicken with the vegetarian option (I really wanted veggies in my dinner that night:) and they did, no problem. I thought it was pretty good, could've been a little more flavorful but now I'm just being picky. My husband got Lamb Rogan Josh which he said was really good, the lamb was tender and the whole dish was delicious. We also got an order of cheese stuffed Naan bread which came out hot and very tasty. \n\nThe service was very quick, our waitress was polite and accommodating, no complaints there. We'll definitely be back, even though it's a little bit out of our way, we had great dining experience there!"
0,I don't see how a business can justify random and large price increases with impunity. They've just never figured out how to be a good at customer service and provide a value for what you get.  Truly ridiculous.
0,"Want friendly service, good prices, safe location? Don't stop,keep going! Located in a strip mall near a smoke shop and a QT many unsavory characters milling around. Recently moved nearby and explained that I like Chinese food and need a go to place for my fix. I ordered the lunch special take-out. Thinking they would like my return business, they would make my order especially robust. WRONG! Upon opening, found egg rolls missing, small scoop of fried rice and lo mien and 2 small pieces of beef with broccoli and as a bonus...all cold and bland. Also missing, fork, napkins, condiments and the traditional fortune cookie. No drink order. Total, almost $9! WOW. No wonder it's always empty of customers. Too bad! :-("
0,"I felt like sharing my yelp message conversation with a person who claims to be the owner of this restaurant, who showed something quite offensive, at best unprofessional.\n\nThe bottom line was: Don't eat out if you worry so much about MSG. Isn't it soooo ridiculous? He claims they don't use MSG but I see he's defending its usage. What does this imply?\n\nFrankly, before the conversation, I felt a bit sorry about having given only 1 star rather than 2 and planned to edit because I still thought the staffs were so nice. But the conversation confirmed even 1 star is already too high.\n\nAlso I want to clarify. Deducting 4 stars was based on the taste only. MSG comment was only for those who are more sensitive.\n\nIn addition, my brief note on MSG. \n\nMSG hasn't been proven harm by FDA as he mentioned. However, some people like myself sense it by having headache, drowsiness and severe thirst soon after eating it, which are unpleasant. Also ramen soups contain MSG. Simply go to Amazon dot com, search Shin Ramyun and read the ingredient. Or simply follow the link. http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00778B90S/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&keywords=shin%20ramyun&qid=1342449390&sr=8-1\n\nHe claims he studied and researched a long time. Probably, he needs to spend more. Anyway, visiting this restaurant already gave me a lot of headaches and I am now blocking him.\n\n----------------------\n Shawn A.  Yesterday \n\nHi\n\nJK\n\nI am Shawn the owner of Mashisoyo. I am first sorry that you did not like our soondubu due to the taste of MSG.\n\nBut is is funny that you sense MSG in our tofu becuase we DO NOT use MSG at all.\n\nWe prepare natural broth every morning for the stew and natural ingredients.\n\nYour review is nothing but negative if you can't prove that we use MSG.\n\nIf you visit us again, I will give you a tour of our kitchen\nso you feel better next time you try our tofu.\n\nThanks\nShawn Ahn\nOwner of Mashisoyo\n\n----------------------\n  J K. Yesterday \nI ordered a spicy soup and it smelt like shin ramyon soup. Seeing you didn't deny the usage of ramen soup, probably you are using it? Even if you didn't intentionally use MSG, using flavored salt (Mat-so-geum) or ramen soup means the served soup should contain MSG. I remember the server saying you use special sauce for spicy taste. I don't know what kind of sauce you are using, but I am pretty sure it contains MSG or equivalent artificial flavor. \n\nI didn't even mention your pork bulgogi that also tasted like MSG or beef dashida. Please check the sauces you are using before claiming your dishes are free of MSG.\n\n----------------------\n  Shawn A. 6 hours ago \nfirst, there is no way you can buy ramen soup only from markets and even if we used shinramen soup it does not contains MSG so your guess is wrong again.I We are tofu house and I studied and researched a long time to find what our  fofu soup takes to be loved by people and people love our soup and bbq these days. They wait in line to have our food. You don't want to say they are wrong about our food.\n\nI advise you not to eat out if you worry so much about MSG because even a hamburger, taco burrito, fried chicken, pho, Thai, steaks, American BBQ,...many more use the ingredients have a bit of mono sodium but FDA says still it is NO harm to people.\n\nLastly I would like to say you in a nice way NOT to criticize easily. We put a hundres of hours , effort ,money, and love to our restaurant to make a living with our  love ones.\nThe comment like yours hurts us so much.\n\nThanks\n----------------------"
0,"I've been to the Breakfast Club dozens and dozens of times, but I will never  go there again. On Saturday, I attempted to go with my husband and 2 friends - and the hostesses wouldn't seat us. \n\nMy friend and I got there and were told of a 30-40 minute wait. As we were waiting for our husbands to join us, this was no problem for us. Then..they got there, and we still weren't seated. When I went to check with the hostess, my name had been crossed off list. Now, we were waiting by the front door, but I know my name was never called. I was kind, understanding that mistakes are made, and I was informed that we would be seated next. \n\nShe then proceeded to seat a group of our size that had arrived after us. I went back up to the hostess station and demanded to know why people who had arrived long after us were being seated before us. The hostess lied to me, telling me that she hadn't told me we were to be seated next, but that we were just \""coming up.\"" \n\nI was shocked that I was getting the runaround, so I took the news back to my group, and as we were discussing whether or not to leave, the hostess seated ANOTHER group of our size that had just arrived instead of us. At this point we got up to leave. The hostess, seeing we were leaving, said \""you know you guys are coming up.\"" Whether that was a taunt or what I will never know, but I do know that I will never go there again. \n\nIt was ridiculous to be treated like a second class citizen while trying to get breakfast. I would rather eat at Denny's, which I loathe, as I know they will at least seat and serve me."
0,I visited this establishment last night with my brother and his wife. I started the night off with a double jack on the rocks which I was charged 10 dollars for. I went back to the bar for the same drink. This time I got a different bartender who charged me 13 dollars. At the time I didn't say anything in case the first bartender hooked it up. Instead I waited for the server and asked him the price of a double jack. When he came back he told me it was 9.50. Basically watch the prices as there is one bartender who is obviously over charging and pocketing the rest. Aside from this discrepancy I did enjoy my time and like the bar. Because it's a nice place I want to rate it higher but this one bartenders practices is not acceptable.
0,"I ordered the Baja Burger. I said Baja Burger. When the food came, it looked like chicken. I said, \""I ordered a burger.\"" The waitress replied, \""It's a chicken burger.\"" Being the reasonable person I am, I assumed I hadn't been paying attention (which has been known to happen) and wondered to myself why they'd put a 'chicken burger' in the burger section. I mean, I read the description - it said nothing about being chicken. Whatever, it looked good so I chalked it up to me not paying attention and let it go. The 'chicken burger' was delicious. So good. I was very pleased.\n\nThe service was pretty slow, especially after we got our food. The hostess cleared our plates and we waited patiently - for who knows how long - for our waitress to come back by. She finally dropped the check, at which point we waited a while longer - long enough for me to take a leisurely trip to the restroom - before she finally came back by to retrieve the check and run my card.\n\nOn the way to the restroom, I passed the kitchen where I saw the waitress either doing her sidework or checking out others' sidework. Either way, I had my answer as to why the service slowed to a crawl.\n\nOh, and on that check was printed, \""Baja Chicken Sandwich.\"" I checked the menu on my phone to make sure I wasn't losing my mind. I wasn't.\n\nI said burger."
0,"NOT FAMILY FRIENDLY!  This place could have had regular weekly customer, but instead, they blew it. I take my child to a therapist for medical issues next door there. Unfortunately, she is an older toddler who is not potty trained and needs changed frequently.  There is no bathroom at the small therapist office.   I thought I would check out the restaurant and use their restroom.  Upon walking in, I was accosted when I asked to use the restroom.  This is something I am not accustomed to.  Very rude.  They said I had to buy something in order to change my small child  in their restroom.  OK, fine, I buy the expensive lunch.  Then I proceed to wait quite awhile to get it, then I notice it has been sitting for some time and the counter person just never picked it up.  I take it home and eat the lasagna and salad. The salad is very good, the lasagna is average.  Kind of disappointing for the price. The place was so busy, I had higher hopes. I complain to my husband about this and he says it is probably because Sonio's is in a bad part of town with street people around.\n\nNow this week, i desperately need a bathroom again. I plan on buying something,  per their rule.  There is a bad storm outside or else I might try to change her in the parking lot.  As I walk in I am asked about getting a table and say i need to use the restroom first.  This time I am rudely told that the restroom is closed because when they have deliveries, the restroom is closed.  Say what????????????????????  What restaurant is so bent on not letting people use the restroom, especially when they have a kid?   This is so rude and insensitive.  There are no other restaurants except across a busy intersection.  I dont understand why the employees dont show a bit of friendliness or understanding.  Doesnt anyone have kids?\n\nI wont go there again.  They dont seem to care about their customers at all.  My customer service experience was completely negative."
1,Had a really tasty burger from here and some great crunchy fries. The wait for the burger was maybe a touch longer than expected - I think it was about 15 minutes. I usually think a burger is a quick thing. I think it was quite busy though in the main restaurant bit. I ate at the bar area.
1,My family are life time clients of the restaurants I have spent 30 of my 32 birthdays at that restaurant their food is amazing fresh there staff are always kind and polite shout out to Billy and Mr.MA I highly recommend both restaurants to anyone that is looking for quality food a celebration feel at home restaurant as dishes the Sweet and sour soup is heaven the duck the chow mein and beef and Chinese broccoli.
0,"Dominicks is a Vegas style restaurant that has taken over the likes of the Scottsdale Quarter.  Although they have the glitz and glamour I didn't feel their food held up to the price or glitz.\n\nThey use a spice rub on their steaks that most of the guests didn't enjoy and the fish I ordered was quite bland except for the excessive amount of salt they used on it.  I would have to say that the side dishes were a disappointment as well.  The tater-tots, although they sound fun, weren't edible due to the amount of grease they had in them and the mac & cheese wasn't very good either.  Again, everything was seasoned with excessive amounts of salt.\n\nOverall the party of 8 I was with didn't enjoy this overpriced meal."
0,The look I got when I asked if the customers is always right ...I got no\nThis place is exactly what is wrong with the country as a customer wanting to pay for something they standby their corporate structure and unavailability to think outside the box they are perfect robots.
1,"Like Home Depot this is a toy store for big boys.  While they have much the same as any other hardware store, some items are different brands. The staff was very friendly making our trip very pleasent."
1,"It's easy to see why the Earl of Sandwich has made a name for itself in Vegas. Although it constantly sports a long line, the Earl is one of the cheapest, filling meals you can grab in the City of Sin (short of trekking to one of the over-franchised food court locations). Compared to food around the world, the Earl wouldn't earn a full five stars. But when you take into account that you're on the strip, probably some degree of hungover or drunk, and looking to save your money for alcohol, gambling, and female escorts, it's probably one of your best bet in the area.\n\nI enjoyed my sandwich much more than my other dining companions seemed to enjoy theirs, but then again, I went with their \""famous hot sandwich\"" - The Original 1762. It sports a huge pile of roast beef, sharp cheddar, and plenty of creamy horseradish sawwce.\n\nThe Earl is open 24 hours. I don't usually crave sandwiches at 4 in the morning in Vegas. But when I do, I make sure it's an Earl of Sandwich."
1,"We were looking for a dog friendly restaurant, and happened upon AZ 88. They are wonderful! They brought out a bowl of water for our puppy, and the staff fawned over her - which we loved! \n\nThey were all very friendly, and service was top notch! \n\nThe food was wonderful as well. I ordered one of their salads, and it was delicious! We enjoyed everything about this place, and will definitely be back!!"
0,Ate there for the first and last time.  Let me start by saying the food was pretty good. \n\nThe price we paid for our meal was quite high for what we had and the serving sizes are small. The wait to order was ridiculous. It seemed to take us forever to get through the line. We were told to find a table and they would bring our drinks over to us. After almost 12 minutes my husband went to the front to find out when we we getting our drinks and were told to go to the bar and get them.  NICE!!!  Finally got the food but no one ever checked on us to see if we were satisfied with the food. \n\nIt was extremely noisy in there but there is very little to break up the noise. Like eating in a warehouse.  Sorry but no repeat business from us.
1,"We tried this for the first time today (Hi Rose!) and I just want to say -- Yum! I could have stopped with the wonderful egg roll, but the food just kept coming. I am upset about one thing -- the Chinese next to my house will never be good enough after going to Wahsun. \n\nI wish I could go and stand in the kitchen while they are cooking just to learn some of the trade secrets. I am one happy customer and look forward to my next visit. \n\nAs others have stated, bring CASH! -- and a smile, because I know you will leave with one."
1,"under 475 calories for each dish....that is amazing! it just proves that you can have phenomenal, simple, yet healthy food and still feel full. \n\nwe shared the yellow beet salad (delicious) and the ravioli app (again, delicious). then for my entree, i had the trout. it was so smooth and tender, i can't believe they didn't use an ounce of butter to cook it. the asparagus and carrots were expertly al-dente (i think that's how you spell it). my girls scallop dish was just as delicious. seared and tender just perfectly. \n\nwe absolutely couldn't leave without trying a mini-desert dish. the pecan pie was heavenly in every scoop as was a (shared) key lime pie. \n\na great restaurant. it's too bad it's a little on the pricey side. what would be great is to have a place like this so more people could see what good, healthy food can be. overall......best restaurant food i've had in a long time!"
0,"Don't tell me the delivery will be 45min - 1hr if it's going to be 1.5hr.

Are you effing kidding me? he's 30 min late instead of telling me $40 is ok instead of $42, he tells ME to go ask coworkers for $3 since he can't break a $20. NO APOLOGY OR explanation for the lateness. \n\nWorst customer service, never ordering again. I signed up for yelp just to write this I'm so irritated."
0,"We came here with a party of 15 people for a birthday. It was a tuesday, so it was almost empty for this GIANT bar with a stage, and the performers were starting to get set up.\n\nI was ordering the food from a kind older waitress who was jottings things down on a napkin when I told her that my boyfriend and I were going to be on the same check. \n\n\""We don't do that here\"".\n\nOkay, thats fine. I'll assumed I could take my receipt and his, and just pay for both. I mean, there's no way they were going to lump 25 people on the same bill, right? I mean.. we had like 10 couples and a bunch of kids. I got the food, which was okay, said happy birthday, and wanted to head out after being there for an hour or two. \n\nI got my waitress, who seemed a bit over her head, and calmly asked for my bill so I could leave. She gave me a menu and said \""Figure it out for yourself\"". \n\nWhat. The. Hell. \n\nFigure it out for myself? What was the point of a register? Do I look like an accountant? What are City of Scottsdale taxes here, anyway? Are we on a barter system? Why do I even have to pay anything at this point, if it is some free-for-all where I tell you how much my food was and you maybe/maybe not charge me?! Seriously.\n\nI stood there, trying to talked to here, for 10 minutes and she just ignored me. Like in a bad movie, I was standing there, making eye contact, while another person who was supposed to be my server pretended I didn't even exist. Unbelievable. I was so furious, I almost lost it. I calculated it out, even though the cost of the drinks wasn't on the menu, and left. BAH!"
0,"What a disillusionment. I had heard good stuff about this deli.\nOrdered  Hot Pastrami  on a roll $6.99 w/chips. The bread must had been day old, the pastrami was cold and tough. \nI did tell the cashier that this was my first time here. She did not mention that there was complimentary ,condiments and free Ice cream bar. I had to hear if for the dude that brought me that dry breaded pastrami sandwich.\nThey do have pasta, what do you thing on that one?"
1,This place is amazing and it just opened up by my house so I decided to make an appointment for a new set of lashes. The lounge is nice and relaxing. Olga was the girl who did my lashes and she was wonderful and I loved the end results of my lashes! They now have me as a regular client!
1,"We were really skeptical about going here for breakfast while on vacation.  The reviews on here were horrible and there was a long line.  After looking around for a better choice, we decided that this was the best option available.  \n\nI am thrilled that we decided to do so.  The line moved very quickly and we got terrific service!  Our server was very personable and friendly without being annoying.  I ordered a Belgian Waffle, which wasn't very expensive and it was delicious.  The prices were a little high, but considering this is Vegas, not out of line.\n\nDon't be scared off by all of the bad reviews on here.  This place is terrific.  I'm thinking the other people on here must be a whole lot pickier or impatient than I am."
1,"My husband and I knew what we wanted to get and we've been saving to get this, which is something expensive.  Amazon, B&H, and Best Buy all had about the same price, within $5 of each other.  Since Best Buy was local and we could get it today, I called the BB closest to us, which is at the San Tan Mall area.  They didn't have it, but they told us a number of other BB stores had it.\n\nSo, we went to Chandler Mall area to get this.  We were hardly in the store a few minutes when we decided to get it.  It's one of my husband's dream things to get and we had saved up quite some time to get it.  \n\nThe sales guy wasn't the friendliest and didn't seem to know that much.  I think someone was training him or the other way around.  Not sure.  Didn't catch his name as I didn't see his name on him.  Anyway, I asked him about extra discounts since this was an expensive item.  I asked him if he could take $25 off, which wasn't really anything compared to what we bought, but it would at least be a free lunch at Rubio's plus for my husband and I.\n\nHe said he had to go ask and he came back and said he couldn't, but he could give us a free something else, which was about $76.  We didn't know it at the time, but we said okay.  We ran into a problem and that same manager had to come.  And due to some technical issues and errors, I thought we weren't going to get the additional thing for free, but the Supervisor Jeff who was there that Saturday afternoon (10/11/2014 around 5 pm) said of course we were going to get the extra thing.\n\nThe thing is, there was no extra promotion for what we bought, but I just asked if they could reduce the price slightly and they gave us a better deal, which what they gave for free is something we needed in addition to what we bought.  \n\nAnyway, Jeff gave super extra great customer service.  We have now spent a bit at Best Buy in the past month plus and we'll keep coming back.  I think we get better service at the Chandler Fashion than at the San Tan Market Place, but really, we get great service at both and will continue to be repeat customers.\n\nThank you, Jeff, for making our purchase super satisfactory and giving us exceptional customer service.  We'll be back.\n\nWe did see that Amazon was a few dollars less than Best Buy and BB does have a matching price guarantee, but with the extra $76 thing, no need to be greedy.  We were very happy and my husband is a super happy man with his new toy!!!"
1,"My dog's birthday was today, and I was nervous to see if she would like the pink cupcake we got her. She ate the whole thing and licked the carpet clean. My other dog loved her little cupcake we got her (she's a Chihuahua)! I also got my birthday dog a shark stuffie and she loves it. I'm very happy with the products! Will definitely be returning!"
1,"All I can say about this restaurant is that the characters in and around it are extremely colourful!\n\nI also have to comment on what seems like an Italian invasion of Edinburgh. Maybe it's just where I live, but stepping out of my apartment, there are about seven Italian restaurants to my left and at least five more in the other direction. I mean, I'm not complaining, but just a little curious as to what happened!\n\nFerri's restaurant is conveniently placed in the crux of some of Edinburgh's nightlife, namely the the Playhouse, the Omnicentre and the multiple number of clubs in the area. It's one of the more noticeable of the Italian restaurants, and the menu is ridiculously expansive! It would take SEVERAL visits to even sample half of what they offer, but I think it would be worth it just for the amusing company!\n\nApart from an interesting exchange with the owner on Antigua Street, I've had a couple of old Italian men sitting outside on stools give me a smile and some kind words (I'd like to think they were!) A restaurant with bucketloads of personality is how I would conclude."
1,"I have lived near here for two years and always wanted to stop in for breakfast or lunch (they don't do dinner). The waitresses were very friendly and you could tell that most of the people in here were regulars b/c they were all being called by name - nice touch. \n\nI ordered coffee (black), two eggs, country ham with biscuit and grits. The food came out in about 5 minutes and it was freshly cooked and hot. The menu said their eggs are farm raised but did not ask if they were local. The coffee was refilled often and they also brought out a huge glass of ice water. \n\nI love places like this, look bad from the outside, inside it has white and black checkered floors with red vinyl seats, no frills, but the food was very good. \n\nPrice was right too. I will go back :-)"
1,"oh man! This is my Jam for sushi! Hands down! the service is typically good but if its a busy night bring your patience. but in regards to food, the amount, the cost & the presentation-impressive!"
0,"First visit--January. 4  star review. Please read the most recent review, further below...\nREALLY surprised about this place. First off--the decor was swanky and the servers were young(-er than the usual diner folks). The menu was short--which is a good thing--and the prices were very reasonable.\n\nI ordered the 2 eggs (scrambled), with hashbrowns (homemade!), meat (bacon) and coffee. The eggs were fluffy, the hashbrowns were delicious, and the bacon was very tastey.\n\nAnother of the group ordered the blueberry pancakes--which were both delicious and pretty to look at. Cake-like, but crispy on the edges, delicious.\n\nThis diner is open 24/7 and is in a great location!\n*******************************************************************\n***Re-visit 3/13/11, ONE STAR REVIEW\nOk so after a fun night at a couple of bars and a good nights sleep... we headed (with a group) over to Queen City Diner, excited to revisit and have some of their delicious food. Um... I really wish we would have gone somewhere else. I give this place less than a month to stay open. Here's why:\n\nWarning sign #1: No cream for the coffee. They ran out and didn't have anything but 1% milk.... sounds like their distributor isn't delivering for a reason--they might not be able to pay their bill? Anyways--no cream for coffee isn't something that should EVER happen in a diner.\n\nWarning sign #2: Understaffing. Why in the world wouldn't you be full or even overstaffed at a downtown diner the day after the largest bar crawl in the world????\n\nWarning sign #3: Everyone was \""new\"" and that was the excuse they gave for poor service, long wait times, running out of coffee (yeah they didn't have any reserves), and the kitchen screwing up orders.\n\nWarning sign #4: Loooooooooooooooooooooooong wait times. Some of our party waited OVER 10 minutes for their DRINKS to arrive. And they weren't \""busy.\"" Our food took over an hour. Did I mention they weren't busy? Also--when they finally brought out the food, they brought out everyone's EXCEPT for one persons.... oh yeah, it's because the kitchen forgot to make that order.\n\nWarning sign #5: The kitchen screwed up at least 4 of the 9 orders... and when they were delivered wrong--the staff IGNORED us. And they never bothered to bring the hashbrowns that I ordered even though they were reminded over 5 times.\n\nWarning sign #6: The food quality was... poor. The last time we ate there the food was excellent--thick cut bacon, fluffy eggs, homemade hashbrowns, delicious and light pancakes.... this time--the bacon was obviously cheaper and thinner (and had less taste and they served less of it), the eggs were \""meh\"" and NOT fluffy, the hashbrowns (which someone else gave me a taste of since they never brought me mine) tasted like the frozen patties you get at the grocery store that they just put in a food processor (not the best). Oh did I mention there was no cream for the coffee?\n\nWarning sign #7: When the time for the check came--I spoke up (again) about our orders STILL not being right--the fact they never delivered my hashbrowns or my boyfriends biscuits. We were going to get a \""discount.\"" WHen the waitress FINALLY brought us our checks--I was shocked--a measly 10% that didn't even cover the cost of my MISSING HASHBROWNS. When it was pointed out to our server that I was not happy about this, and that I felt that after this bad experience that there should definitely be more of a discount, I was ignored. I shouldn't have paid them, I realize that now. \n\nI was completely astounded at this place today. Several people got up and left--one couple was very angry (their orders were also messed up AND they waited a long time). The thing is--they HAD the staff today... but it seemed only one person was doing the work--our poor server, Hannah (bless her heart). HANNAH--you might want to find another place to work, just a tip, you're a sweet girl and a good waitress, unfortunately the rest of the staff is what made run around frustrated today! The shift manager delivered food... but mainly stood around and watched Hannah hustle around frantically as she was the only waitress working... along with what appeared to be a bartender/drink lady person who didn't bother to make coffee, refill drinks, or help make any drinks like it appeared she should have been doing. Oh and she was constantly rolling her eyes and frowning. I think this lady and the (un) friendly greeter should both be doing something else besides customer service. \n\nMy tip? DON'T GO HERE. It's overpriced for the quality, you'll waste a LOT of time, and you will not be treated well as a customer. I will NOT ever go back to this place. Sorry QC Diner--but your presentation today was absolutely pathetic."
1,"Just a quick note to tell you how much I appreciated you and your team.  They did a great job, were happy, professional, and made every effort to perform an excellent service.  In this day and age it's hard to come by, I'm glad I found you.  Thanks again!\nAndy Tobias"
1,"Obviously Bachi Burger is doing something right if they have the money to continuously remodel, make renovations and open new locations. I been coming here for about 2/3 years now (normally at the Windmill location) and I never been dissatisfied! Don't think for a second its just any burger joint though.. Bachi serves American-Asian infused gourmet burgers. Every burger on the menu will have a surprise Asian ingredient, may sound weird on a burger.. but actually works!\n\nI recommend the.. \nBanh Mi Burger - my favorite, its almost like a Vietnamese sandwich.. hence.. \""banh mi\"" burger lol! Looove it! Must must must eat it with the fish sauce.\nShogun Burger - for all you eel lovers out there (me included), you'll love this one!\nPork Belly Buns / Duck - Either one, both are delicious. (3 pc shared appetizer)\nParmesan Truffle Fries - It comes with a mayo based sauce to dip with, but I like it with the pineapple ketchup.\n\nI would try some of the beers too, I personally haven't tasted any myself, but my friends say its some of the best beer they ever had, as well as their special non-alcoholic beverages. This place  gets really packed around dinner time so be prepared to wait a little."
1,Super friendly. Staff remembers your name (and your order if you are a creature of habit). The cuban is one of the best
0,"This review is for the Southern Ave location ONLY!!  I gave it one star because of the horrible service.  It has been bad for awhile, but since we live really close to this location, we kept giving them a second chance.  NOT ANYMORE!  The waitress took 15 mins to bring extra pitas, plus it took 45 mins to deliver our meal. She wasn't very hospitable either.  When we complained to the manager, all he said was \""if ya gotta leave, leave\""!!!!!  Wow, no apologies or anything.  Won't go back to this location."
0,"We originally loved this place, but have noticed lately that their service is going downhill.  They had online ordering/menu available, but turned it off.  When you ask the woman at the restaurant she tells you to just call in your order.  Problem is that you can tell her you'll be there in 10 minutes and they don't start the food until you arrive.  Kind of defeats the purpose of calling ahead.  Grumpy service = loss of customers = loss of $.  If the service isn't good it doesn't matter how good the food is for us.  We will be shopping around the area now for a new 'regular' Chinese take-out restaurant.  What a shame!"
1,DavidsTEA is a great tea chain that has a lot to offer. You can purchse teas from a VERY wide assortment of teas and flavours with the opportunity to let your nose sample the scent of any tea they offer. The atmoshphere for the shop is very inviting with a nice bright interior and with aqua accents as is the colour scheme of the company. Employees are always incredibly friendly and helpful. There is limited seating inside the show where you can sit down and have a hot or cold tea based beverage of your choice as well if you'd rather have something there than make it at home.\n\nLong story short if you love good tea and variety this is the place to be!
1,"Stayed here with my hubby for two nights (of four) when in Montreal for my cousin's wedding.  As soon as we walked into the room, we wished we had planned to stay there all four nights!  The petite suites are beautiful - huge but cozy and inviting.  The staff are wonderful - helpful and friendly.  And, as other reviews have mentioned, the turndown service (with two chocolates - like the old days!!) is so inviting!\nThey apparently have a really nice roof deck cocktails and food, but we were there in winter so it was (obviously) not open.  We were so in love with this place that we plan to come back next summer!\nDefinitely stay here!  One small caveat -- there is a decent amount of street noise if you are in a room overlooking Rue St Paul.  Since we live on a noisy street in DC, it didn't bother us (it was quieter than home!), but if you live in quiet suburbia, you may want to ask for a room in a different part of the hotel that may be quieter.  Or bring earplugs -- it's worth staying here even with a bit a noise!"
0,"The girl who worked in the Starbucks lacked customer services, unfriendly and are very rude. Not the kind of service I typically gets at Starbucks."
1,"I like my normal mechanic, but they are so busy lately I decided to give H&H a shot.  I was able to get in the same day which is apparently not common.  I didn't ask for pricing up front, but I was just getting my oil changed and a couple bulbs replaced.  I think this is the cheapest place I've had a full-synthetic oil change...cheaper than the drive-through oil change places.  I was given a time estimate upfront for how long it would take and within about 15 minutes of that time I received a call saying my car was ready.  My car runs so much better now.\n\nI'll need some major scheduled maintenance soon and requested a price quote for that.  It came back at what people in internet forums say the repair should cost.  I'll get a quote from my usual shop as well since they are more familiar with audis and I do like them. \n\nThe waiting area is really more of a drop off/pick up area, but there is a dunkin donuts next door or you could do like I did and pick up the light rail at the east/west station across the street and ride around until your car is done."
0,"Hate to say this, but I really wanted to like this place. Everything started out great, we were impressed with the beer selection and we ended up getting a great beer flight. That was all that was good about this place. \n\nAfter ordering drinks, our waiter disappeared. We finally had to ask another waiter to send him over so we could order food. If only we had known, we would have stopped after ordering beer...\n\nWe started with the \""Devils on Horseback\"" (bacon-wrapped dates) and they were shameful and bland. You want a real bacon-wrapped date? Head over to La Cave inside Wynn next door. \n\nI had high hopes for the mussels since they came highly recommended from the staff, however those hopes were dashed. They came in a giant pot (not good for sharing, even though our waiter said they were...) and were also tasteless.\n\nWe stopped ordering after that since the food was so disappointing. We ended up having Dinner Part 2 later on that evening since we were still hungry after leaving Public House.\n\nSkip it, there are a thousand better places within a stone's throw of this place."
1,"Friendly and caring service. Great prices, delicious house sharer. Sweet port wine and cheap beers. :)\nLove the warm and relaxing atmosphere."
0,"If I can give NO STAR to Cosmo, I would.  \nWe had horrible experiences with THE Cosmopolitan.   No matter how beautiful your decors are in the hotel, I don't sleep at the lobby or the bar area at night.  I rather you provide us with decent services instead. \n\nFirst strike, the toilet was full of shit stains when we arrived the room.  You don't have any excuses of given an uncleaned or unready room to your guess especially when you charge so much. \n\n\nSecond strike, we were wakening by a loud \""BANG\"" sound at 6:58 a.m..  I thought was earthquake, actually it was the cable box from the TV dropped and broke the table lamp.  We had to called the customer services right away to get the mess fix, and it took the technician about 40 minutes to arrive.  And another 10 extra minutes for the housekeeping department to clean up all the broken glasses.  \n\nFor all the yelpers, don't you guys feel bad for me at this point, it is literally Vacation Nightmare.\""  \n\nThird strike, The same night of the Fallen Cable Box disaster, the Housekeeper never came by to fix our bed, change the towels, and make the room.  BTW, We tipped the Housekeeper whom cleaned the broken glasses from that morning.  \nIt is HORRIBLE.  Called in to request them to get our bed fix, and we made a request to have them please come by after 5 p.m. because we were tired from the morning disaster and all the sightseeing, and the coordinator was agreed to send someone over around 5.  \n\nSo, half an hour passed from the time I called, someone knocked on our door.  It was the housekeeper and we have to send them back.  I almost had a heart attack.  I have to talk to someone that understands about services and accommodations.  The manager got on the phone with me and explained that \""the housekeepers get off at 5 pm and no one can provides us services after that time.\""  HOW come no one told me that when I make my first request.  And the manager explains\"" We didn't anticipate the back up.\""  WHF are you talking about, and Is it your first day as a manager for such a high end hotel?????? \n\nNever trust the housekeeping services from COSMOPOLITAN.  I rather stay at Wynn Encore, they are much better with services and everything else.  COSMO, you suck and you failed on us over and over again.  Will never recommend anyone stay at COSMO."
1,It takes something major for me to come see a doctor. In this case I lost hearing in my left ear. Dr Dennis Dey was quick to asses the problem and prescribed medications to resolve my issues. He is very knowledgable and kind. I am back a month later for a follow up visit and my hearing has returned. I am very grateful to have my hearing back and thankful to have met him!!
1,beautiful hotel and no casino (no smoking at all). rooms were very large and comfy. fabulous bathroom with jets in deep tub. $25 resort fee and the outdoor pool closes at 8pm (not sure why as there isn't a lifeguard anyway and many guests would love the pool at night). valet only parking but it is included so you just have to tip. right across from the fashion mall and easy walk to the strip. WiFi included.
1,"The very best hair salon! \nI have been coming here for 5 years now and absolutely love it. \nJosh, the owner, is the best!!!!!!"
1,"It's place is amazing. The amount of effort it takes is true devotion. Take your kids here, let them see how veggies grow. The chickens are awesome and I would totally take one home if I wasn't afraid my dog with have it ala king within an hour. Go to an event here. It's super awesome and really becomes a part of a community. A community that Las Vegas definitely needs."
1,"I've become a regular here...I love how fresh everything tastes. My usual is a berry blast smoothie, Roasted garlic hummus with extra pita bread and a prima grilled cheese without tomatoes as I'm picky about how my tomatoes are cut \n\nThis place had met my expectations repeatedly, a definite go to."
0,Place works very slow the severs keep playing around and when I got my spinach artichoke dip there was noodles on the inside of it.
0,Never did pay us the money they owed us for our fundraiser and karma finally caught up with them. This location is CLOSED PERMANENTLY! good riddance to poor customer service and sub-par food.
1,"Chompie's has a nice atmosphere.  We went for brunch, and we ate outside. I ordered the blueberry pancakes and a side of eggs and sausage. The pancakes are huge and could be their own meal. I did not want to eat only pancakes so I ordered a side of eggs and sausage.  They don't have a meal with the flavored pancakes and eggs.  It was very good. \n\nMy friend had the two eggs and a side of potato pancakes. She loved it and kept saying they have the best potato pancakes.  While I didn't try it, she is a regular and loves their potato pancakes. \n\nOur server was very friendly, and took care of us.  She could have checked on a little more, but over all it was a very good experience."
1,"Fast, fresh, easy. Those are the words that best describe Jimmy John's.  This location is no different. Talking with one of their guys it sounds like they are expanding across the valley. I know I'm hoping for some new locations on the west side!"
0,"Am giving it a two star for the pool area ! But the service is horrible , we arrived from a 3 hour drive with my family we were all tired from the drive , we arrived and waited 35 min in line to check in with our room not being ready. We had to wait 2 hrs to get our room . They why do they have a check in at 4 if there not gonna have ur room ready ?! So frustrated . To make things even worse I had to ask if me room was ready and one of the management there was so Rude to me and my family , her name was \""Lea \"" being a manager she could at least been more professional and understand that there guest come to have a nice relaxing vacation . She embarrassed me and was talking to me with a loud voice that other guest where looking at us . Even one guest went up to me and told me that was just wrong of her . She never apologize to me . I let her know that was gonna be the last time I will be going to her hotel and she just turned around and walked away. Mark my word I will never go back to there hotel. The only friendly people that I sow and would always greet me with a smile and a hello was the housekeeping crew !"
1,I love coming here for day clubbing. I was pleasantly surprised to find the pool to be heated in early March. But come in May this place gets so freaking packed.\n\nTry the frozen lemonade!
1,"I must say. I like Red Rock. Not just because it's less than 5 minutes from where I live, & cause I don't stay in different hotels often, but it's nice.\n\nI'm not going to really dig deep because I don't really know how to critique a hotel that much. I do have some highlights you'd want to hit up.\n\n1. The lobby: Huge chandelier. Really pretty & a must see at least once. \n\n2. The buffet: The desserts are the bomb shizzle. From pies to gelato. Man, can't pass it up... oh, they have kim chi! ^_^\n\n3. The pool: Really pretty setting. Caution: Not for athletes. Only for relaxation.\n\n4. The spa: Not so exciting. I'm pretty sure it's for those \""if you're trying to get away\"".. or something. It's actually kinda warm in there.\n\n5. Food court: Delish! Burgers, chinese, mexican, starbucks, & ice cream spots. Hands down, wallets up, good.\n\n6. The movie theatre: It's poppin on weekends, full of adolescents, beware.\n\n7. Bowling Lanes: It's poppin' there too. Very close to the food court & movies. They used to have dollar games on Mondays.. I wonder if it's still going on.. \n\n8. Not much of a highlight, but park on the 3rd floor of the parking garage closest to the freeway. There's elevator access that leads straight to the Bowling lanes, movies, and food court! hehe. ^_^"
0,Not a very good selection. Had to wait for food to come out. Lots of fried options. Wanted to like it. Just didn't sit well. Sounds like timing at this place is crucial.
1,"BF and I went to Triple George last Saturday without a reservation.  Place was very busy, but we were seated quickly.  We were acknowledged by wait staff immediately, and brought water and bread.  We ordered Kir Royales, and our server had no idea what they were, which was surprising.  I have had them before in TG.  But fortunately bartender knew what he was doing.  We shared steamed clams for appetizer (broth was to die for), shared a caprese salad (didn't have enough balsamic or basil for my taste, but tomatoes were ripe, big and delicious).  BF had the porcini crusted ribeye and baked potato.  Both were HUGE, and he ate as much as he could.  Almost finished the steak and some of the potato, and he is usually a big eater.  But he thought the steak was delicious. I had Dover sole with mashed potatoes.  The sole was a whole fish (small) and was deboned and filleted at the table.  Delicious and the potatoes were perfect.  Too full for dessert.  We told the waiter that we wanted the service to be leisurely, so while he checked on us regularly, didn't put in each course order until we said we were ready.  Service by CJ was terrific, altho he started off a little stand-offish, but we were old friends by the time we left.  Another great evening at Triple George."
0,"The security guard who works at the front desk is rude, unfriendly and offensive as can be.  He seems to think he owns the place and bosses people around."
1,"food was great, large portions. the server was very friendly and attentive. will definitely go again!"
0,"Ruined my weekend in Vegas!!! messed up my cut. so simple how hard is a taper fade with a 4 on top. Old man gave me a 1 all around with a 4. So pissed. 17 bucks is a damn rip off... Nice people, but don't deserve there barbers license"
1,It was wonderful.  It's not cheap but they are not cheap on the serving sizes and quality.  I think I was over served with some great food.
0,"This was the worst meal I can ever remember having! The only positive part of the meal was the waitress's positive attitude.\n\nWe ordered a Escalante Margarita (their version of a Cadillac) and a Blood Orange Margarita. The Escalante went back because it was too sweet. The Blood Orange tasted like punch, but I decided to just deal with it.\n\nWe ordered a ceviche (Shrimp and Ahi) appetizer. It was really shrimp and avocado in a wine glass with V8 Juice! Sent it back!\n\nWe ordered Beef Fajitas to share. Asked for the meat to be Medium Rare, what arrived was medium dead! They included only three cold stale tortillas for the two of us to share. We asked for some more tortillas and they brought three more, only this time they were the way tortillas are supposed to be. The meat was way over cooked and drowned in oil (maybe the lifeguard chair in the entry way was for the guy responsible for preventing drownings, but he was off for the night). (BTW, they tried to charge $.75 for the extra 3 tortillas)\n\nBecause we checked in on Yelp, there was a free desert offer. We ordered the non-coconut Flan. We received a medicine tasting coconut Flan. The waitress took it back to get us the one without coconut, but came back saying that the kitchen does not know the difference between the ones with coconut and without. (Really, hope they know the difference between rat poison and pepper!) We were offered another desert choice but had already given up and free still  sounded too expensive!\n\nWith all the problems the waitress told us that the manager told her to only charge us for the drinks but did not bother to come and speak with us. (The comped food bought them no good will, as the manager did not feel the need to do better or hear from his customers! I give this place 3 months before they  close their doors.)\n\nMore reviews at http://www.thevegasevent.com"
1,"Great sports atmosphere, creative name, clean and fun.  Their dish, Black Friday was a bit confusing though.  It is supposed to be a slider, but it is a bit too large to be called a slider."
1,"Just ate here last night, wonderful experience...let me tell you about it!\n\nI use OpenTable to make reservations, in order to build up points and get free stuff, but that's another story. The Dhaba is OpenTable friendly, so I made a reservation and we were sat immediately. We also found a Groupon, $18 for $30, so dinner was already $12 off before we walked in the door. \n\nIt was a Saturday night, around 7pm, and the place was practically full. My wife and I noticed that there were a lot of Indians eating here as well, which is always a good sign of authenticity! We couldn't help but notice the numerous placards and \""Best of...\"" awards hung all around the entryway. While this place was new to us, it certainly wasn't new to the area and has won many prestigious awards. \n\nThere was one hostess who also took orders while 3-4 other servers brought out food, refilled water, and pre-bussed the tables. We never needed a refill, never had dirty plates, and were always taken care of. This was a wonderful aspect of our dinner. My wife and I decided to try our favorite Indian staples: Samosas, Chicken Tikka Masala (Heat index - 6), Tandoori Chicken, Saffron Biryani Rice, and Garlic Naan. \n\nThe food was wonderful. My wife enjoys a milder heat so we settled with a 6 on all our dishes (out of 10). The heat was calm with just enough *umph* for her. The flavors were delightful as I mixed them together. Tandoori Chicken in Tikka Masala sauce with garlic Naan bites. Yummerz! The presentation of the dishes looked beautiful and the servers were attending to our every need. We were very impressed with the customer service.\n\nIf you are in the Tempe neighborhood and looking for a wonderful Indian food restaurant, please check this place out. They are outstanding. My wife and I prefer this restaurant to the many other Indian restaurants within the area, and will definitely find our way here again!"
0,"Aah, Old Country Buffet, one of the first buffets I ever went to growing up. As a matter of fact, this and the Superstition Springs one were the two I went to.\n\nAbout maybe 11 years ago, we went to the S. Springs location.  We went there probably once a month and enjoyed it each time.  Until one day, we noticed the rotisserie chicken wasn't cooked all the way.  All my mom did was ask the waiter to tell the cook that the chicken wasn't cooked all the way.  Then they got the manager and he scolded us saying \""Well, you guys are just trying to get a free meal\""  After a little big of an argument (mellow on my mom's side) we left.  Last time I ever been to one.. until a couple weeks ago.\n\nAnyways, enough about the past.  Went here for a lunch one day, just, you know, see if it changed at all.  Walked in the door and totally remember the winding entrance (be quiet, it's nostalgia for me).  Were greeted and seated right away.  I remember the big drink station in the middle.  There were a lot of tables of course, then I looked at the buffet.  \""Wheres all the food?\""  I know it was lunch time, but the buffet was way small.  I've been to dozens of buffet's since this place and this place is childs play compared to others.  \n\nThe quality of the food is pretty much the same since I last remembered, maybe a slight less.  Probably won't come here again though, there's other buffet's out there"
1,I want to say...always good service..Denise is friendly helpful and makes sure I always get my local discount and they give a big bag of mints for shopping there! Love the personal service!!
0,"First time I went to this location and I am never going back.  I ordered two smoothies and one of them wasn't filled all the way compared to the other one (the other one was filled to the brim)!   It was like ordering two sandwiches and receiving one sandwich with half a bun.  I felt like I did not get my money's worth as there was a 2.5-inch waste of volume they could have filled.  Also,  I was careless enough to not check that they correctly stamped enough spots on the stamp card (gives you a free item after the ninth stamp).  They only gave me one stamp even though I ordered three items.  My fault for not correcting them.  However, I felt screwed over from just one visit.  Not coming back to this location.  The one on 215 and Jones is better."
0,"Ate here before the food was good, but service horrible. We thought we'd give this place a chance again... We were directed to the opposite side of the room away from any servers and we're were waiting for about 30minutes counting without being noticed. I feel embraced and about to leave.  Thank you yelp for allowing a place to share this experience."
0,3 negatives -\nShower makes this a 1 star.   There is no way around this.  Poor water flow and the half glass shower is not cutting it.\nLady Luck elevators are still present although covered up with some faux wood trim. Promotional credits were not granted to me even though I had given Cristina the code at the front desk. Shady.\n\nThere is tons of potential here to be a 4 star based on the value.
1,"The pork belly was my favorite!  Clean and cute inside.  Very interesting to sit and eat bao in a hair salon, but hey! It works and it was fun and yummy!"
0,"Meh. I mean it's not terrible. Prices are ok. Service is ok. Pizza is ok (pretty greasy though). I did like the option of the different flavored crusts. We went with the garlic herb. It was ok. Other options were Cajun, parmesan, jalepeno, and a few others. The decor gives me anxiety. Way to much yellow but I guess that's a HH signature I suppose.\n\nNothing really to write home about."
0,"This place is total Ice Palace......so it is a great place in the summer.  Really....if I lived closer, I would just sit here all day and order H2o.  I came here with a girlfriend only because she had a gift card.  It is kinda of cool you can watch hockey practice here. It is a total sports bar so the set up with TVs, I really liked.  I notice the booths had their own TVs...that is really a nice setup!  Anyhow, we had salads....not a specialty place for that kind of food......this place is all fries, onion rings and burgers.  Our salads were  bland but  for 9-10 bucks ....GET THE BURGERS!  We were out of our element but we had 50 bucks to spend!  What's a girl to do?"
1,"Great and reliable business!   If you need someone who is honest and quick, this is the place."
1,"My friends are probably exasperated with me because I won't shut up about how delicious the brownie I bought here was - seriously, it was a brick of chocolate happiness, and MASSIVE (...and I am not one to shy away from hefty desserts). I should have stopped halfway through and couldn't, but I think it was worth the stomachache. \n\nThe taco salad with vegan chili was tasty (although the large percentage of tortilla chips kindof made me feel like I was eating nachos grande, detracting from the healthy factor..), and I'm really excited to try the other vegetarian options on their menu."
1,"In Tempe, people don't go to biker bars, they go to bicycle bars. : )  Spokes serves up fresh, slightly healthier versions of your typical bar foods for a reasonable price (Less than $10).  They also offer more vegetarian options.  This is the 3rd day since their opening, and it was decently busy for a Thursday night.\n\nThe interior is pretty nice, and has various bicycle-themed accoutrements, such as a pair of silver owls made out of bicycle parts.  The bar and dining area is very spacious, and TVs line the walls.  There is a patio area which overlooks the gorgeous lake area outside, which I will definitely have to take advantage of once the weather is nicer!\n\nThey offer a wide range of beers available (20+ on the menu), as well as iced tea and soda.  A nice thing about their iced tea is they offer Stevia in their sweetener baskets.  \n\nOnce we were seated, we were handed menus.  Despite it being just their third day since the grand opening, my menu was already splattered, sticky, and had a large tear on the side.  Putting aside my distaste at the sad state of my menu, I opted for the veg-head sandwich, while my husband had the carver burger.  The veg-head sandwich was decent.  It had fresh vegetables such as red bell pepper and eggplant in it, as well as fresh basil and mozzarella.  It had a sweet balsamic vinegar sauce with it.  As a whole, it did taste a little bland (Maybe it needed some more of the balsamic?) and the eggplant was tough and bitter.  I tried the carver burger, which I liked a lot better.  It was a sizable meal, with juicy, perfectly cooked to order meat, and very flavorful ingredients. The only real negative for my husband was that he felt the burger needed some more seasoning to bring out the flavor of the beef more. We both had sweet potato fries as a side, although you can also get sides such as salad, soup, or waffle fries with your order.  The sweet potato fries were awesome.  They were light, crispy, with just the right amount of seasoning.\n\nService was fast and friendly, and the owner came by to chat for a little bit, which I appreciated.  They offer happy hour and a reverse happy hour, and are open late until 2 A.M.  \n\nOverall, a pretty good experience here at a nice restaurant and location."
1,"A really good local coffee shop in Surprise.  Amoungst all of our corporate coffee shops this place is a hidden gem.  They have live music, local artwork on display, and great coffee.\n\nDo yourself a favor and try it!"
1,Wednesday 2 banger is awsome
1,"Had a blast with the family.  We took advantage of their special for $5 for an hour of unlimited arcade play.  The kids (and myself) loved it.  They have a great mix of old school games for me (Ms Pac-man, Frogger, Paperboy, etc.) and newer games for the kids.  Don't normally play the driving games because of the cost, but with 4 player games, the whole family could race against each other.  Only down side is the water park not being open, but I totally understand, we travel during school times of the year, and they can't keep it open just for me.  Totally recommend taking the family!"
0,Extremely annoying! I called to see what time they where open till that day and they said midnight. (Even thow yelp said 2am but I called to make sure). My friend and I took a cab there exited to go because we've never been but have heard about it. We arrived at 11:20pm and they said they where closed....are you fucking kidding me? After I SPECIFICALLY called to make sure this wouldn't happen. They didn't seem to care that I was lied to and my trip over was a total waste of my time and money. Boooooo! To bad I didn't get the chance to try the food to rate otherwise :(
1,Long wait (40 minutes) on a Friday morning. Guess it's due to limited seating capacity. But the Five Spot and home fries were delicious!
1,This place rocks. There are always 20% off coupons to be found so you never pay full price.  Their regular prices are cheaper than most if not all of the other cleaners in the area.  They are a family business and the service is friendly.  I have never had a problem with my clothes and they also preserved my wedding dress for only $110.
0,"I love the sushi and go there all the time but one time my boyfriend and I went after the gym and had the worst server ever. She was a total bitch. We ordered a philly roll and a scorpion roll and she was like \""just two rolls? Ugh.\"" And walked away. Like are you serious? There goes your tip. And she never got us drinks."
0,"*yawn*\nThey should call this ride \""X-YAWN*\n\nYea, yea, yea... It is located at the top of the Stratosphere tower, but so what?  This ride was expensive and it is LAME!  It is like riding a see-saw.  They tip you forward, you move forward... they tip you backward, you move backward.  Bleh.\n\nWaited in line for the front row.  Was hoping this ride would be a ride of my life, but was bored out of my mind during the whole ride.  Didn't feel any acceleration whatsoever.  \n\nTOTAL WASTE OF MY MONEY..."
1,"Got some disappointing news so my man decided to cheer me up with an evening at Yard House. As usual we sat at the bar (its where the most chill and fun people sit ...my kind of people) and we were greeted quick as lightning by Nick. He was very nice and got us our beer (I chose my usual Pyramid Apricot Ale....great girl beer...and my man switched it up and got a Murphy's Stout). The evening was looking up. \n\nOn the menu they have AMAZING mac n' cheese squared. It has pasta that looks kinda like a combination of girl's and guy's junk...and makes me laugh....throw on some bacon, mushrooms, chicken, and a plethora of cheese and you have a fantastic dish. I wasn't quite feeling that on this somewhat somber evening so I opted for the Hawaiian Poke Stack and my man got his favorite bernaise burger. It was cooked perfectly and quite delicious. \n\nI wanted to throw caution to the wind and try a new beer. I asked Kristen to point me in the right direction. She gave me a tangerine white ale (I think) and was very knowledgeable about all the beers. Unfortunately, the tangerine beer didn't agree with my taste buds. I informed Kristen of this and she couldn't have been nicer, cooler or more apologetic about it (super professional). It truly was not a big deal to me for I just went back to my usual beer. \n\nMy night got waaaay better thanks mostly to my wonderful man but I must say Yard House helped out the situation lots and lots. Will be back for Mac n' Cheese soon :)"
0,Old crabby waitresses. Food is ok. But don't extract to be greeted or asked how the meal is going.
1,"My go to Pho place in the east valley, even though its a 20 min drive from me.. its way better than the new Pho Grill place that opened in Gilbert. Plus my fianc\u00e9 that HATES Vietnamese food is actually a huge fan of their grilled short ribs so I can convince him about once a week to fulfill my cravings! \n\nGreat service, great Pho! Great grilled dishes, have never tried anything here I didn't think was fresh and flavorful! I eat here once a week! Try it! \n\nThe only thing Iam taking 1 star away is I can tell the broth must have a little bit of MSG, based on the amount I can eat VS the 6 ice teas ill chug trying to eat it."
1,"I love these guys. I'm in the military and I've moved around a lot in the past. These guys are very affordable and fair. The first time I hired them, I had a few family heirlooms and they got them to where I needed them, in one piece. I went through Eli and he was very professional and kind. I hope I can use them again."
1,"Found this place while driving outside the airport before I had to catch a flight. Was tired of eating at the usual places in the airport, so ventured out and found a good meal.  I got there ~5:30 on a Friday, so the place was almost empty, decor was nice, somewhat upscale w/o being too stuffy, and the staff courteous and attentive.\n\nI perused the menu for anything that would catch my eye, nothing stood out, seemed more or less your typical Italian menu. So I looked over the featured three-course meal - starter, entree and dessert for $30, where you pick one in each category, figured why not.  I ordered the lobster gnocchi, ribeye w/ red wine sauce and tiramisu. On top of that they had some nice touches of a higher-end restaurant, complimentary tomato brushetta and mango sorbet before the entree. The gnocchi was the best - the vodka sauce was light yet present, steak was undercooked in some parts and tiramisu was good  though espresso was faint if there at all.\n\nOverall, I thought this was a very good deal for the food, service and amenities.  If I had to pay more, it be more like a 3-star, but if you can take advantage of the three-course special, it's well worth it."
0,Poor service and food was disappointing.  Plus the bathrooms are cleaner at mcdonalds. Seriously...it was disgusting. One (of the two) sinks was missing the handles. Classy.
0,"Horrible, horrible, horrible. First, the service was incredibly slow. There were two tables and two servers, yet we waited many times throughout the meal. Water refills took 12 minutes! I ordered a boba drink and got mysterious clear and gritty boba, complete with a large piece of plastic wrap, yes plastic wrap. The table behind us (the only other table) sent back their rice, as it was served in a dirty bowl.  The food was less than flavorful. We will never be back. Do yourself a favor and avoid this place."
0,Every time I go here my burgers are swimming in grease. You unwrap the paper and theres a pool of it. Gross! This was my second time here. I figured I'd give them another shot. Nope. Same thing. 2 stars for the Frosty. That's it.
1,"My friends are regulars at Roma Garden and I've joined them there several times now. The service is good, the food is great. Huge portions and they'll custom order for you when they have the ingredients on hand. They don't rush you through your meal and have a nice balance of attentive but not intrusive service. The free Amaretto at the end of the meal is an added bonus."
0,"One word: overpriced. Another three: Glorified fast-food. So you order like a fast-food/take out joint, then take a seat and they bring you your food and make a token \""everything ok\"" stop. The milkshakes were to-die for (literally, probably shortening your life span by a few weeks due to the sheer fat & calorie count).  The burgers were pretty good, the \""not-to-be-missed\"" truffle fries were over-exaggerated IMHO. Loud music, uncomfortable seats. Won't be in a hurry to go back."
0,"I tried this place based on the Yelp reviews.  I was interested in finding a solid thai restaurant in Chandler.  This is not the place.  Very overpriced and food was average at best.  I really wanted to like this place and be able to support a local downtown Chandler establishment, but the food is just not good enough to keep my repeat business.  They need to check their prices against what they are producing and try again."
0,I called I told them I was new and I saw this ad for 15 off so I made an appointment. My boyfriend brought her in and her haircut looks great! Here comes the problem... Since we didn't PRINT the ad and just showed it on our phone they charged us 50 dollars.. How ridiculous!
0,"I love dive bars and I love Chinese food so I thought I would LOVE this place. Unfortunately, I also enjoy not overpaying for flavorless food.\n\nService was bad.... waited too long for someone to bring menus, didn't tell me the specials when I asked. When we asked for boxes, my food was taken from me and the server was gone before I even had a chance to object. Check was never brought to us, we had to go search for our server to pay.\n\nFood was flavorless and really greasy....only time I've ever been served Chinese without soy sauce.\n\nYou could tell who the regulars were..... they were being served. I guess the staff isn't interested in adding to that list! Felt like we were interrupting play time by asking people to do their job. \n\nOverall, it sucked and that's sad because I kept trying to like it."
0,"This is the worst Teeter around, no questions.\n\nFirst of all, whos bright idea was it to put the Redbox in the already narrow  entrance way? Not to mention most of the morons who use it will stand in a straight line back from the machine totally blocking the door, instead of curling to the side to let those of us who are there to actually try to buy food, do so.\n\nAnd thats even before you get in the door, its all been said before me though. Over-crowded, stuffy, poor produce, ok meat selection. The basic layout of the store is moronic (ie. the deli counter area). \n\nIf I have the time I will drive up to the 24 hour in University, but most of the time get stuck here due to lack of choices. Damn you Teeter!"
1,"I liked it. We sat outside on the patio for lunch and had a great people watching experience. I ordered the special flatbread for the day, sausage, carmelized onions and cheese. My friend ordered the buffalo sloppy joe. Both meals were amazing we also ordered a side of fries to split.  Good portions and very flavorful food all around. The only thing we would have changed was that the sloppy joe came with tator tots. And looking at the menu, they list sweet potato tots as a side. So naturally we assumed they tots would be the same but they weren't. They were just regular old tots, nothing special.  Would definitely go back for lunch again. Also, the hotel decor, bar, lobby and lounge were stylish and seemed to have the potential for a good downtown hotspot if marketed correctly."
1,"The food is always amazing. The Palm Beach Salad is a longtime favorite because it's fresh and consistent. Crab, avocado, red onion, tomato, lettuce. The French dip is the most delicious steak sandwich. This time we had the Margherita Pizza which is thin, crunchy and tasty and the bread pudding is DELICIOUS."
0,"I come to Vegas fairly often and I have shopped at many H&M stores, including this one. Today I asked the curly-haired black lady by the register for a plastic bag for my coat because it was cold outside and warm in the casino and I didn't feel like holding it. She curtly told me more than once that she would not give me a plastic bag unless I bought something. A plastic bag. Terrible customer service!!!"
1,"Nice friendly service.  Its a family owned business and the people seem rough and rude but once you get to know them you realize it's just their strong personality.  They have the best wings in town and my whole family have been coming here for the past 16 years.  I have tried other places but nothing beats the wings here, not even buffalo wild wings which to my opinion not so good.  Family from out of state either come here to eat when in town or ask me to take them some when I go visit."
1,"Went on a Friday night (the online reservation system was very useful) and had the Olive appetizer (which was worth the 5 dollars just for the amazing homemade sourdough bread that comes with it), the spicy chicken and the whitefish. Everything is carefully thought out, balanced, and with excellent quality ingredients (same goes for the cocktails - we had the sazerac and rhubarb3). Would definitely be interested in going again in the winter and seeing how their menu changes with the season."
0,I've been coming here and even worked here as my first job 15 years ago. It's going downhill. I order a coffee it's cold I send it back and they say they'll brew another pot so I go park and wait on nuggets and coffee. They bring food to car the new coffee same cold temperature missing fries in bag and never gave me the bottle of water I ordered! I understand hiring kids cause I was one that worked here but this place is terrible now. The manager needs to manage and monitor things better!
0,"Expected a lot more based on the other reviews. Cappuccino was a little bitter, and I was surprised that their default was to serve it in a paper cup for drinking it there. \n\nThe barrista was nice, but seemed bored. Cute decor, but so echoy it was tough to have a conversation. Walking down to Paradise Bakery might be a better option for anyone seeking good coffee at the Biltmore."
0,"DONT MAKE THE MISTAKE WE DID\nI stayed here over the past weekend with my wife and a group of friends. When we checked out there was a charge on our room that neither my wife or I approved or knew about. I called the front desk and waited for over 20 minutes for anyone to answer only to be told they could not help and would transfer me to the Spice market Buffet where the charge was from. When they transferred me it was a dead line. NOT COOL!! called the front desk back, waited again, this time the took my phone number and said they would call me back. When they did call me back they just said that the charge was valid and that they could do nothing about it. I explained that i had signed nothing stating that there would be any charge to my room above the $200 credit on the room. I also explained that our room was never cleaned on Saturday. I was again advised that someone would call me back. They did call me back and state that they would refund another party of our group to \""make it right\"". Not really sure how this helps me out at all. Bottom line is no refund has been issued and the additional charge to my card was done fraudulently! Planet Hollywood please call me and make this right!!!"
1,"Well...I have found my new favorite place to grab a good sandwich for lunch while here in Arizona.  Friendly staff and good music as well as the lovely display cases with some mouthwatering desserts make a good first impression.  While looking at the many options on the menu our server brought some tasty pickles as well as pickled tomatoes which I've never had but not bad at all.  As far as food goes my husband ordered a half pastrami sandwich and I had to try a bite.  Juicy, warm spiced just right pastrami was complimented with the right amount of sauerkraut and Russian dressing.  I had the prime bite which had a perfect roast beef, a cream cheese spread with some caraway.  Lovely addition to the overall flavor of the sandwich.  Even my daughter's grilled cheese on challah bread was toasted perfectly.  Big sandwiches meaning you get your bang for your buck."
0,"Why am I reviewing Taco Bell? I like this particular Taco Bell because it also is a combined Pizza Hut. \nI like to get pizza on the go when I am in a hurry, so this is pretty convenient for me. What I do not like is that they ALWAYS mess up my order here. I can't even count how many times I've had to walk back into the store and ask for them to fix it. \nOne time, they asked me to pull in front of the store to wait for my pizza because it was still baking for about five more minutes. If I wanted to wait for my pizza I wouldn't have come to a FAST food joint. If you don't have it ready, tell met that so I don't have to wait and be late getting back to work. Anyway, I ended up waiting about 10-15 minutes before I walked into the store just to find out that they completely forgot about me. I had already paid and everything! \nI do love that they have Mountain Dew Baja Blast at this location."
0,"I bought a voucher for this place from one of the deal sites. They accidentally crossed of my name on their list showing that my voucher was already used when it hadn't been. They then proceed to tell me that their verification method was fool proof (how can it be when nothing is scanned and everything is manually checked off by hand?) Then they tried to prove that the voucher I brought in was a photocopy reproduction (it wasn't, it was printer from a printer). All in all, a terrible experience, tried to make me out to be a thief. Why would I even go through all that trouble and reproduce a very \""real looking\"" fake voucher to save $10?!? At the end they realized their mistake. By then I had already 25 mins of my time and my order had already gotten cold. There were no apologies from the restaurant. The food was also very salty and the bubble tea was very chalky. They use powered coffeemate to cream their teas which has a huge taste difference from actual condensed or fresh milk. With all the Chinese food options in that area, I know I will never go back to this place."
0,I bought a groupon for a facial and I made my appointment and took the day off from work. I showed up 15 minutes early only to be told that my appointment is at their Jones location. If you have the henderson address on groupon and yelp and only 1 phone number to call then how are we to know they have a second office? What a waste of my time and money. I'm going to try to get my money back from groupon since this was such a horrible experience. This place seems to have a really bad scheduling issue and it was a pain for me to even get an appointment. The lady at the desk at the office only said that she was sorry and there was nothing that she could do. I was really looking forward to it too. I do have to say that the office did seem to look pretty nice- Too bad I didn't get to have my facial and I wasted a vacation day.
0,Asked for glazed they are out. So I get apple. Walk out and notice they gave bear claw. So I go in as they bring out glazed. Really you didn't know the glazed was coming in 60 seconds.  And just rude. Why be in service business and give customers attitude. I will say the donuts are fresh but I say this all the time if you just don't care how sanitary is the food your serving.
1,"First time visiting Yard House and although there were a few hiccups overall I really enjoyed it. First off Steven our waiter was great. He was very knowledgeable and helpful with us in navigating the large menu. They have a ridiculous amount of beer on tap and I had two of Stevens suggestions that were fantastic. \nThe food is where the experience lacked a bit. I ordered a steak salad as I wasn't too hungry my wife got the filet. Both were over cooked even though I ordered med rare and my wife medium. Both steaks were med well, but since we aren't too picky we ate them without complaint. They were OK. Honestly nothing special but good. \nThe Desert trio souffl\u00e9s were delicious and we left satisfied with our New Years eve dinner. We for sure will be back in the future."
1,I ALWAYS got to come here whenever in town. Love their freindly service and the loco moco. I've tried their other dishes but can't seem to get away from deciding on loco moco :P Fair price for the serving you get of food you don't find everywhere. Highly reccomend!
0,"This store is always busy. Plan on spending some time there after you type your name in on the screen. I was turning my equipment in because I am done with Cox cable. Waste of money. I have one word for them,.......Directv."
0,i came looking for what I thought were standard items in larger Asian grocery stores and was disappointed.  Mekong and Lee Lee on Dobson have much larger selections (vegetables/herbs/meats/seafood) at cheaper prices. Too bad because I live so close to Super L.  Maybe I'd come back if I wanted some Peking Duck or Roasted Pork from the deli.
0,"This is about the one near Hilldale.  Awful. No stars.\n I guess we should have taken our clues form the emptiness of the restaurant and the fact happy our lasted until closing....\nThe margarita was a sickly peach color and was solid in the pitcher.\nThe plates were served with the thumb of a dirty oven mitt in the food (I'm guessing they came out of the microwave).\nThe enchiladas were slimy and water-logged covered in a dilute, flavorless \""mole\"" (i wouldn't call it that.\nThe rice was instant and without any seasoning, not even salt,  with a couple bits of also favor less corn.  The waiter did one of those disinterested \""howseverythinggoingeverythingokay\"" before we flagged him back to say it was inedible. We declined his offer to make it again and just received a bill for the margaritas that we also left.\nOn the way, when we commented on how gross the food looked as well as tasted, another dinner confirmed she would never go there again.\nSo we went across the road to Pascals and had real margaritas and excellent enchiladas with Mole.\nStay away!"
1,"Hands down the best pizza I've ever had. I'm Italian and from back east, and the pizza back home is just better than what Vegas has to offer. This place has made me eat my words. You CAN get great pizza in Vegas!  And you get it here!  It makes me sad I'm out of their delivery range, but they are well worth the drive, and I make that drive often!"
0,"Not great, not terrible, nice people."
0,"Salty Senorita in Scottsdale... mexican food, football on flat screens, outdoor seating, margaritas!  Kinda sounds like a little piece of heaven to me?  What's not to like, right?\n\nThe horrible service.  \n\nYou might have read the other reviews.  You might be asking yourself if it's really all that bad?  The answer is yes it is.  The little girls they hire to wait tables are across the board worthless.   After watching them I started to question whether or not they literally walk out of their way to avoid seated customers.  \n\nIt's too bad, because Salty's has all the right stuff... but apparently also has all the wrong people.\n\nIf I'm wrong, I'll never know.  After eating there twice and having the same experience, there simply won't be a third time.  Too bad."
1,"I had this just yesterday. It was late at night and we were craving Chinese food but didn't want the typical Panda Express. So, I asked Siri to find me a Chinese place and because of the 4 stars we decided to give it a shot. The food was delicious! It was brought out in a timely manner and the staff was very nice! Overall we are definitely going back. :)"
0,"Our family is so disappointed in the downgrade happening in Fresh and Easy. Nothing worse than a price increase and a quality decrease at the same time! \n\nI got my fiance hooked. I loved Fresh and Easy. I started shopping at one by my high-rise in Central Phoenix and then relocated to Greenway and the 51. We love high quality products and found some great ones at Fresh and Easy. \nThis morning I gagged drinking my coffee. We have been buying their half and half for about 8 months. We were buying 5 quarts a week. It tasted like I used whole milk instead of my creamy wonderful coffee. I looked at the label and sure enough. The label now says milk with cream. My guess by the taste is they waived the cream over the top and added a tablespoon.\n\nLast week they reduced the size of our favorite coconut cookies. We were buying 2-3  a week to a package that is 75% the size of the original one. Last month they changed their sour cream and put the words \""all natural ingredients\"" boldly on the cover  and it couldn't be farther from the truth. It barely has any cream in it. They were charging $1.15 for the longest time. Then jumped up to $1.35 and then down graded from Cream and culture to a chemical blend. \n\nWe loved their tortilla chips until they another could be oil Canola oil which in research was the cause of mad cow disease and is a bug killer and totally detrimental to your health.  \n\nCheck this out.  RAPE IN A DIFFERENT GUISEhttp://www.living-foods.com/board/read.php?f=1&i=21641&t=21641\nIn looking at the ingredients through out Fresh and Easy they are downgrading rapidly to low quality no reason to shop there but to say hi to the great staff kind of place.\n\nOne door is closing for us and Costco is regaining our business back by offering high quality organic foods and to die for half and half for only pennies more than were were paying Fresh and Easy. \n\nWe are very bummed out for the layout, staff and selection verbiage at least is aligns with our family mission statement. \n\nSo I write today with hopes they put the skids on their down grading quality. I want the world to know their products are tasting weird. Even their whole milk is tasting compromised. It doesn't have a fresh taste.  Sadly many of Fresh and Easy's products that once were great are getting gross.\n\nOur family would really pay the price increase and have the same great quality and quantity.  We feel downgrading the quality and raising the price is deceitful and dishonest not to mention a potential toxic addition to our all ready overloaded with toxins world."
0,"Food is not worth the price,  eggs were dry, chorizo dry and no flavor, I could have made pancakes at my house and they would have tasted better,  all the glasses were dirty, and lipstick stanied, the coffee was good and the waitress was great, the food was just not worth the price and will not go again."
1,"So we've been looking for gastropubs in the area and the first to pop up on yelp is this place. We decided to drop by the place after a not so wonderful experience at a concert and this place really made me feel a lot better. The food and ambiance are great! We got here pretty late so I was surprised they were willing to seat us. \n \nWe had the 'Tender Belly' Pork Belly Pastrami, 'Kilt Lifter' fondue, and we were intrigued by the \""Pig in the Orchard\"" Bread Pudding so we ordered that as well. The prices are a bit high (every thing we ordered averaged $10), but everything tasted great so no complaints about the price from me. The service is a bit hit or miss hence the minus 1 star but I will definitely be coming here again."
1,"Fast service & food. They have quick daytime drive through staff. Have been coming here for about a year and a half. Sometimes the WiFi works, which is always nice, if you're inside. The free drink refills are good, as some places inside of casinos, charge the entire price for a refill. It is conveniently located across the street from Mandalay Bay and is frequented by people who work on the strip, so you know it's easy to deal with."
1,"Walked past this store dzns of times & never went in! Not sure why, but glad i finally did!  \n\nWe were greeted immediately and in a nice & unobstrusive way.  We were given a few samples, and it was pretty clear i was not going to make a purchase this time since all the products were new & different to me, I was just gettting educated :-)\n\nThis didn't hinder the salesperson, who still gave me some cupons, samples & a full bar of rosemarry soap!  \n\nThe sample ended up making me go back 2 days later, as the shave cream was the best shave hubby ever encountered!  I purchased and entire shave kit with lots of goodies, more samples, and the sales girl threw in a bamboo soap dish (bonus!).\n\nI'll be back to ck out more products after i finish using up my arsenal already in my possesion!"
1,"There's literally only two reasons to ever go to the Galeries du Parc. One of them is the Cin\u00e9ma du Parc, probably the best rep house in the city, and the Spicy Noodle. Fast, dirt cheap and delicious.  Location's a bit weird, but if you're in the McGill Ghetto area, there's no reason to swing by."
0,Great environment and outdoor seating these limited spring days. Wonderful service but mediocre food. Enjoy drinks but skip the bland food.
0,Ridiculously slow!!!!!!! 20 terminals but only staffed with 5 ppl...on a Saturday night!
1,"If you are going to book here, book a suite. A king suite is AWESOME. We upgraded to this room after booking a regular one... It looked like a scene from the Shining! But... Our upgrade made this cheap hotel VERY worth it! Beautiful suite! Plus... AMAZING location! Make sure you hit up the Carnival night club inbetween Imperial and Harrahs. Very fun! Good service. Good times. Vegas baby!!"
0,The cheese pizza was so salty it was inedible. I have to think something has changed or the accidentally dropped the salt shaker on this one. Please check the sodium content on your ingredients Barro's. \n\nI hope your reading your reviews and taking this stuff to heart. We have loved supporting this business for the last 10 years+.
0,"As a cupcake geek, I was pretty excited when I saw the beginning construction for this place earlier this year. So, I take no joy in expressing my disappointment with Cupcakes By Design. \n\nThe first time I went in there, I was really surprised by what I saw. For $3.50 per cupcake, I expected a little bit of creativity in the decoration or something. Instead, I found cupcakes that were about the size of what I bake at home with what amounted to a dollop of frosting. Yes, they obviously used a piping tip but there was no sense of fun or creativity in the decoration. And for $3.50, there should be a lot more frosting. I had their banana cupcake which was OK. It was the first time I had a banana cake that wasn't like banana bread but rather cake with some banana flavoring--though I believe they used fresh bananas. The frosting was...meh. Whenever I go to another city, I always stop at a bakery. And it's rare that I've seen any place charge $3.50 for the size that this place offers. I just can't justify it in this case.\n\nI was also a little soured when I stopped in their another time to talk to the owner about an event I was having. I wasn't even asking for any donations--only if they happened to have day-old cupcakes they wanted to get rid of. If not, no big deal. I was going to go on and explain about this community event I was putting on called CupcakeCamp and maybe ask someone to come judge and I even had a little flyer, but the owner totally shut me down before I could go further. She wasn't rude by any means. But she certainly put the curt in courteous. I understand having trepidation with a new business and it's fine to say no to me. But to not even hear me out first, frankly, kind of sucked. And if you're a new business, you'd think one would want to hear about an opportunity to freely promote to a big crowd. I probably won't be swinging by here again until I feel like all bad cupcake karma has been vanquished."
1,"Big fan of Mesa Grill, especially for lunch. \n\nTheir menu is very reasonably priced for a fancy casino restaurant and although their menu isn't extremely extensive, they have quite a few dishes to choose from. On this occasion, I shared a Mesa Burger and a Swordfish club with fellow Yelper. The burger was extremely moist and delicious. This was lunch date's favorite dish. The sandwich was really good. Filled with tons of avocado, bacon and swordfish between two (slightly too thick) slices of bread. The french fries were perfectly seasoned.\n\nWe finished our meal with a slice of coconut cake and the mango rum upside down cake. Both were fantastic as well.\n\nService was great. Our glasses never went unfilled and the waitstaff was extremely attentive. I highly recommend this place."
1,"We were here for a wedding. Everybody invited was from out of town and we all stayed here-A good 50 people or so. The hotel staff was extremely friendly and bent over backwards to make us happy. The rooms were large and had a nice mini kitchen.  I can't recommend this hotel enough. Everyone else we spoke to was highly impressed. They even helped us heat up large bins of leftover barbeque and let us store the food in their kitchen for a pool get-together.  The shuttle to and from the airport was very handy as well.  For the price, we were so happy the bride and groom choose this hotel."
0,"Never have I been so ripped off at a smoothie store than at TCBY Fruithead Smoothies.\n\nUnfriendly service, wrong sized order at first, wasn't nearly enough yogurt, too much ice, way too expensive, forgot vitamin boost, horrible bland flavor... this is the worst airport food I've ever had.  Go to a Wendy's and get a Apple Pecan Salad instead."
1,"Good beer, good food. Love the cashew butter and jelly sandwich with bananas!"
0,"My bf and I came here because on the online menu we saw the grilled romaine salad and wanted to try it out (we already went to Bliss for dinner). We walk in and let the guy know we are there to order the salad to go and he proceeds to send us to bar. \n\nHere is where the problem began, I over here the host tell the bartender they don't have the salad on menu anymore which is weird considering how long they have been open, next why couldn't he have told us at the door instead of telling us to go to the bartender. So the bartender came over to let us know the salad wasn't on the menu. He was not the friendliest bartender and we both work in the service industry. We decided to order a cocktail and then the salmon salad to go. While we are waiting we see the \""host\"" next to us taking shots with two friends and thought this was weird. Anyways all this happened on Wednesday night and it was not busy at all. The drink was the only good thing about this place. We won't be back!"
0,"TRAINWRECK!!! \nProof positive that it ISN\""T just Location! Location! Location! \nWhile Koi has an excellent home at the heart of the strip...\n The ambiance is dark, the management are non-existent, and the food is sub par and completely overpriced. The only saving grace was that the drinks were strong and the staff were all to eager to give away cocktails for free as compensation for their ineptitude and/ or indifference. For such an empty restaurant, one might expect reasonable service and fresh food. However, our oysters smelled rancid and steaks were unrested with blood mixing into the sauce all over our plates. Eeeeewwwwww! \n  Our server was inattentive and our attempts to have our issues addressed by the arrogant asian manager walking around casually were abandoned when someone from our party finally caught a glimpse of him, sitting by himself at a table in the dining room and staring at his iphone for no less than 15 minutes. Pathetic! While we stared at inedible food he never made it over to ours or anyone else's table to check on their experience... At least we all got a good laugh, after our free drinks, at how little anyone really seemed to care that we were there to exchange our hard earned money for a meal... what a unique concept-\n  Ultimately we wrote the experience off as a total loss and won't be back to Koi any time soon. Hopefully they get their S#@! together and remember they are in the service industry. Times are tough and you aren't exactly exceeding anyones expectations. I've never been in a more underperforming and empty restaurant on the strip. A new low..."
0,"This post is for anybody who likes pizza but doesn't like be treated like crap. My wife and I ordered Pizza Re pizza a couple of weeks ago and called at 8:50 pm. We asked how late they were open and if they had any specials. They gave us the info we needed and then we told them we'd call back. When we called back at 9:05 pm we were informed that they only take deliveries until 9 pm and that they were not going to deliver to us. We explained that we just called and even told them we'd be calling back. Any person with common sense would say \""Just to let you know we don't take delivery orders after 9 pm\"" but they didn't. They reluctantly took our order and delivered the pizza. When we got it home it was great and the sauce is awesome. Now to get to the good part of the review. We just tried to call tonight at 8:58 pm because we knew that they stopped taking deliveries at 9 pm. When we called we were put on hold and then at 9:02 when the person came back on the line we were told that they stop delivering pizzas at 9 pm. I explained that we did call at 9 pm and he said sorry. I told him that we want to give Pizza Re our business and we know how hard it is for a small business to survive, because I run one, and that we made it in under the wire. Again, he stated he didn't care. So I said that I was going to give my business to Little Chicago another local company. I used to deliver pizzas in college and it boggles me that a company stops taking calls at 9 pm when they close at 10 pm. Is Pizza Re too good to take my money? Are they doing so well that they cannot take orders after 9 pm? If this was a real concern then they should advertise on their website that they stop taking orders at 9 pm, but they don't. These questions might go unanswered but one thing I am sure of, I will NEVER call them again. A consumer should not be made to feel bad that we're bothering a business by patronizing them. In this economny local small businesses should be welcoming customers, not driving them away with poor customer service, bad soft skills and workers that don't really care about the customer. I'm sure if the owner answered the phone they would have taken the order. But because the workers at this business care more about closing then making money, I'm sure they'll be closing their doors soon. Just another local business with a great business plan and poor execution. I hope the owner reads this and takes a hard look at the people they have answering the phones. They are the Pizza Re's 1st impression and they are doing a very poor job."
0,No longer open in the sun coast casino!!!\nClosed for months\n\nHow can this been on yelp. Incorrect info!!'

1,"Last Sunday morning we noticed that our 14 year old miniature dachshund \""Star\"" had a swollen left eye that was covered with pus.We were very concerned since he could barely open his eye. We called the 7 Hills Pet Hospital and they said that they would see him right away. Dr. Sabharwal examined Star and diagnosed the problem as an infection. They gave Star a shot of antibiotics and treated his eye with ointment. They also prescribed antibiotic pills and ointment for us to administer twice a day. Dr  Sabharwal had said that the infection would be cured in approximately 5 to 7 days. Today is Thursday and the infection appears to be almost completely cleared up. I don't see how this could have gone smoother. Two thumbs up!"
1,"Great sandwiches...make sure you get their dutch crunch bread because it's awesome. They lose a star because the three times I've been, it's been impossible to find a clean table. And they never responded to my request for nutrition info :("
1,"Now, I know that it may seem weird to yelp a very common hotspot like Starbucks, but I have to say that this is one of the best one's I've ever had the privilage of calling my \""regular\"" stop. \n\nThis Starbucks is located in the Fry's Grocery Center next to the UPS Store and Fry's. The reason that I keep coming back here is simply that the people are SOOOOOO friendly and they've never messed up on one of my drinks. \n\nSince I teach at the high school down the road, having a Starbucks close by is very convenient. I always hit this place up when I have to stay late. Everytime I walk in, I'm always greeted with a \""Hey, how are ya?\"" and at this point they already know my order. There's this one blonde lady that works there that has been sparking up small talk for a few months now. I mentioned to her casually that I was heading to St. Louis for a couple days and when I got back, she actually remembered and asked me how my trip was!! Super impressive. \n\nLove the staff, love the caffeine."
1,"My friend and I saw Monkey Lights during our first Critical Mass ride, and HAD to have them.  My friend Gail is pretty relentless when she has a goal, and she had phoned up all the local bike shops by the next week to search for said lights (Google them - they're AMAZING).  The guys at Trailhead ordered them and we paid the same we'd pay on Monkeylectric's web site, less the shipping.  The guys were friendly and helpful when we went to pick up our lights, which came in just a couple of days.  The cafe is awesome, too."
1,So good. Pho Van's broth kills it.\nI want to bathe in that shit-
0,"low quality and pretty expensive, dont go."
0,"A friend asked me to meet him at Buffalo Wild Wings for a beer and some wings.  I can honestly say that there was not one positive part of my experience.  The service was terrible - I'm pretty sure our waitress had been drinking.  She was inattentive and slow.  The wings came out and were average at best.  The celery & carrots had a brown slimy coating, so I returned them & a food runner brought back a new basket of celery & carrots with the same slime on them.  GROSS!  My friend bit into his chicken finger, and found a small metal screw in his food.  We called a manager to the table, who was mildly apologetic but only took the chicken fingers off the tab.  Our friend was served food with a foreign object in it - That could have been extremely dangerous...You would think maybe a beer or 2 would also have been on the house....but NO.  Instead, the manager told us how much he didn't like his job and how he was looking to get back into bartending for his career (as if we cared!)\nI hate to sound harsh, but this restaurant is trashy and a waste of space.  If you want amazing wings, head over to Johnny Macs in Henderson."
1,"a little confusing at times to get around but overall not too bad! Make sure to walk past the main food court to find a little more options. That being said, it is still airport prices A.K.A 9 dollar sandwhich"
1,"LOVE IT! A must go. Super friendly staff, great booze and even better food. Expect to wait about 20 minutes for a table for dinner. Lunch is a bit faster. YUM!"
0,"This place was nice at the casino not to many people however, some of the workers were rude. The place after late hours on the strip was not a safe feeling environment and one part of the place where the food places were had nothing but homeless and smelled bad. Not a place I would recommend for someone to stay at. Advice; keep for a last resort."
1,Attentive service and delicious food in trendy and fun cafe atmosphere. I had quinoa salad with chicken and vegetable soup. Boyfriend had lobster pastry. We shared a Mille feuille for dessert. I like to think of myself as pastry connoisseur and it wasn't the same as a Parisian Mille feuille but still delicious (pastry sheets were a bit thicker here). Definitely a great lunch spot.
0,"SCAM SCAM SCAM!! I WILL NEVER USE THIS COMPANY AGAIN. They picked us up fine from the airport to the hotel, but going back to the airport was horrible. The shuttle never even showed up. We called them numerous times, the customer service lady kept telling us, oh the driver is on the way, just wait there. We waited an hour and 45 min. We had to catch a cab to the airport. We even called the customer service for refund, but they didn't even pick up the phone. \nSHOWTIME TOURS IS SCAM. IF YOU WANT TO HAVE A GREAT TIME IN VEGAS, DON'T EVER USE THIS COMPANY."
0,"Came in with a party of 11 around 11PM and did not have a wait. The server was nice but a little slow. It is pretty spacious and open but seemed a little bare inside. I did not really see the value in the price as portions were kind of small.\n\nLobster roll - good! It was creamy and fresh. The bread was toasted with the right amount of butter.\nFish & Chips - gross, did not finish this due to lack of flavor and crispiness. The french fries were decent though.\nCalamari - over-fried and over-breaded. I did not enjoy these very much.\n\nPricy with some okay food and some bad food. I don't plan on coming back with the amount of options there are in Vegas."
0,The Service: Okay... took the order fast. Serve the food fast. But our server never checked on us after that.... Not attentive. \n\nThe Food: SUPER OVERPRICED Chinese food. Since it is at the Palazo Hotel so it is expected.\n\nFish porridge - Lots of rice..... only a few pieces of fish for $19!!!! So not worth it. Not much flavor too. Very disappointed.
1,"I used to go here all the time, went back recently and they have upgraded their presentation of how they serve your food if you eat in.  The sandwiches are still just as good.  I always get their half sandwich and half salad.  The pizzitis are good tasting, you just don't get a lot for your money if you are hungry.  Great spot for lunch!"
0,"The man who owns this store seemed nice at first but is actually very rude. I tried on several scrubs and accidentally got some makeup on the collar of a couple of the tops. Instead of griping about it after I left (like any normal person would do), he went ahead and got on to me right there as I was checking out. I apologized and even offered to help get the makeup off, but he proceeded to laugh at me for my offer, shook his head in disappointment and explained that he would have to take them home and wash them. It was an extremely uncomfortable situation and I will never give him my business again. I should have walked out instead of buying the scrubs that I ended up getting. \n\nI will give the younger lady there credit for being very helpful and patient with me in dealing with my indecisiveness. Unfortunately, the old man will drive most of his customers away."
0,I'm not a fan of the food there... but I certainly love the black-cherry ice cream they serve! :)
0,"Food was stale. It tasted bad. Not many options. Service was pathetic, 10 of us wanted to sit together and they did not join our table. Also, dinner is very pricey. I would never go here again."
1,"If there is one thing I mass about ol' Chambana - it's Red Herring. This place is just so wonderful. Where do I start?\n\nMy typical memory of it would be walking in on a blisteringly cold day. I'd be greeted by steamy warm, earthy air. My glasses would fog up and I'd go blind for a moment. Once the fog disappeared I'd be greeted with a wide variety of the community - from the still thinks-it's-the-70s hippie to the like-oh-my-god-check-out-my-North-Face-fleece! sorority girl - everybody is represented. Definitely more hippies than greeks - but yeah. I suppose I fall in the middle there and never felt out of place.\n\nThe place is staffed mostly by volunteers who as I recall get paid with a meal for a certain amount of work. Go there for a little while and you'll quickly get to know the staff - they're all great.\n\nSo next it's time to order. They have their daily menu listed and it's always different. Prices are not bad - $5-8 will get you a full meal as I recall.\n\nSo the food - I have yet to buy something here that wasn't fantastic. Maybe I'm easy to please (as some of the other reviewers would make one think) - but geeze - it's all so great! There is a clear stand out though - the BBQ tempeh sandwich. I've tried to recreate this item at home (since I now live halfway across the country!) but I just can't get it as good as Red Herring did.\n\nI've taken many people here - from red blooded meat lovers to normal folk and everybody else - and I have yet to hear a complaint. Fantastic place - highly recommended!"
1,"Started with the Elote Callejero (Grilled corn w/ Cotija and smoked Paprika), which was different than most corn I've had.  Wife got the Chilaquiles Verdes with chicken, while I had the carne asada burrito.  The carne asada beef was made really well.  Thoroughly enjoyed it.\n\nThey also serve Lux coffee which is very very good.  Service was ok but left a little to be desired.\n\nIf you go to the men's restroom, the urinal is in the shape of a pair of lips."
1,This boutique was one of my absolute favorites! I used to always shop here when I was trying to find a cute outfit for a special night out.  I was so sad to see the actual store front close.  Although I guess they are still online- that seems to be the direction many clothing stores are headed right now.  \n\nI think the Hilton Village is doing a complete remodel because many of the stores there are all closed right now.  \n\nI did find out that their other location Sherre's up in Cave Creek is still open so I will continue shopping there!
0,"Were to begin... No one welcome us in, we had to sit ourselves. I ordered the dinner combination chicken bulgogi and shrimp tempera. Their was no taste at all... Should've went to panda next door and  prices is way too high."
0,"I have given Wing Stop a try twice so far. The first time I dined in and the second time I ordered take-out, but unfortunately, I did not enjoy the food here. \n\nGarlic Parmesan Wings (regular and boneless) - the taste is not too bad, but after eating two wings, I feel like I have to stop because it becomes too salty!\n\nSmoked BBQ Wings (boneless) - the chicken was very soggy, both times.\n\nSeasoned Fries - pretty soggy, some were not cooked very well. \n\nSweet Tea - I usually love sweet tea, but this was very bland. I should have just filled up my cup with unsweetened tea!\n\nAlso, I thought it was weird that when you dine in, the \""napkins\"" that they provide is a community roll of hard brown paper that you have to tear off (located next to the drink machine) Really?!?!\n\nThe only plus is that they have very friendly employees who are more than happy to explain the menu to you or make any suggestions. \n\nSorry Wing Stop, I'll be going elsewhere for my chicken wing fix!"
1,"This review is just for the pool itself, during the day time...and no booze. There were plenty of chairs laying out, when I went out around 11AM. They have about four different pools and I believe one pool that's heated. I have no idea why you would ever want to go into a heated pool in Vegas in June, but hey...whatever floats your boat! \nThe towel station is towards the middle of the pools and plenty of bars and waitresses every corner you look. \nThere were quite a bit of family around me and an older man in the pool that seemed to be having a little too much enjoyment from watching children play in the pool. Other than some weirdos in and at the pool, I felt comfortable laying out for a bit."
1,"This place is awesome.  I have typically gone to the Chandler location but will be coming here from now on.  While I have not checked out the other services available, I am sure that I will at some point.  For now, the brow service is the only one that I get.\n\nVanecia (not sure about the spelling) was absolutely amazing.  She was very meticulous and did everything she could to ensure that my brows looked amazing.  I don't need them done very often but will definitely come back when I do."
1,"LOVE THIS PLACE! I was introduced to them because of a Yelp event held there recently but I loved it. The patio front and side are awesome. Now that the weather is getting a little cooler here - I can't wait to go there and participate in one of my all-time favorite pastimes ... drinks on the patio! It's a perfect venue. The parking garage is right across from the entrance. So easy! Oh, and the food was wonderful as well :)"
1,"This is my most favorite buffet in Vegas and I prefer this over the buffet at Wynn hands down! Wicked Spoon is located in the Cosmo hotel and you will probably recognize this place because everyone loves taking photos in the life sized heels that are around the buffet.\n\nI came here for lunch and it was about $40 for lunch. It was a little cheaper than the Wynn buffet but if you want to go more all out, you can get bottomless mimosas for $9 more. I dont know why you would do that if you are already going to stuff yourself with allll those other items. Lunch closes at 3pm on the weekends and dinner starts at 5pm so you cant really linger so you can get the best of both worlds, unless you plan on staying for 4 hours at this place haha. The wait was longer than Wynn and it took us about 40 minutes to get to the front and finally sit down. It is beautiful inside as well and the chairs are comfy. I like the Wynn decorations better though.\n\nThe food is sooo delicious. There is so much variety but I really liked their tacos and their meat. I can describe all the food that they have but looking through photos will give you a better idea. I absolutely LOVEEEEE their dessert selection. They have so many desserts, cakes, macarons, GELATOOOO, tarts, chocolate covered strawberries, and sooo much more. Surprisingly my most favorite item was the yogurt and blueberries in a cup made out of chocolate. I can literally eat everything! I felt like Willy Wonka when he drank the tea and bit into the cup in the field of candy. I probably ate 5 of those. I ended up just asking if they can just give me blueberries and they were more than happy to give it to me. The desserts and food here are just so much better than Wynn and next time I go to vegas, I am just gonna head straight here :)\n\n**TIPS**\n1) Save room for dessert! The selection is wonderfully delicious!\n2) Food coma will hit you bad. Along with lack of sleep, the food coma knocked one of my friends out at the table. It was pretty hilarious.\n3) Enjoy!!!"
0,"I moved from Ohio not long ago and from recommendations of co workers was told this was a great place for a movie.  Well let me tell you about my experience.  I got my ticket, of which they talked me into the upgrade ($25), and went to find my seat.  The ticket host explained which theater I was in and my server would meet me at my seat.  The previews had started so it was dark and it was very hard to see the row or the numbers.  I find my seat and I have to say the reclining chair was very nice and there was a blanket and a pillow.  Good idea, people tend to get cold in theaters.  So the movie starts, I am patiently waiting for the server.  I was told I could order a nice gourmet meal or appetizer, possible a drink and my upgraded seat came with complimentary popcorn.  An hour into the movie someone finally shows up.  Now while I was waiting I looked for a button to push for service, a small light, anything I could do to get a server to see me.  There was nothing like that available and I did not want to get up and miss some of the $25 movie I paid for to track someone down.  So by now and hour into the movie the waiter comes up and asks if I would like to order something, explains these nice appetizers, meals, etc.  Is there a menu? Would I even be able to see it?  So I just ask for a diet pepsi and the complimentary popcorn.  I was concerned if I ordered something it would be arriving as the movie is ending and I have to either get it to go or sit in an empty theater to eat.  By now the server knows I was a bit displeased with the delay and that there was no menu I could look at.  So for the remaining 45 minutes of the movie he kept coming over, would I like a refill? Am I sure I don't want to order something?  And then with about 10 minutes left he asks if I still want a refill and maybe am appetizing dessert on the house?  Really?  I came to get a meal and I did not plan on just having dessert.  I passed on the dessert and decided I would get a bite to eat at one of the restaurants outside of the theater.\n\nSuggestion:  In Ohio AMC has the right idea, they have the same seats you do, what they have that is better is there is a menu at every table, a call button so you can get your wait staff, and small lights between each seat that can be turned down, this way you can see the menu and find your seat number.\n\nThe theater was nice and clean, however I don't feel the experience was worth the $25 for the movie ticket"
0,I'm not impressed with the concept or the food. I was here for lunch and the dining room was darker than most other restaurants are for dinner.
0,"Ouch & GROSS!  Expensive and Disgusting!!  \""Cal-Ital\"" food...How stupid.\n\nHonestly, I ordered the number one listed and recommended item on the menu seafood carbonara pasta dish, and it was absolutely tasteless.  It tasted like wallpaper paste!  \n\nIt was surprisingly awful, since it is owned by Cowboy Ciao across the street, which is very good.\n\nFor good carbonara, go to Uncle Sal's - formerly mafia owned by Sammy \""The Bull\"" Gravano.  I choose good food over decore anytime!"
0,"I took my granddaughters to get our toes done and we were mislead to believe there was only one, very expensive price. After the ordeal, I wrote an appropriate letter to the owner, asking for compensation, and there was no response. I am willing to always give a positive yelp, but this was unconscionable. BUYER BEWARE! \n\nThis is what happened:\n \nMy two granddaughters and I arrived at Nail & Spa at about 5:30 PM, February 22, 2014. We picked our colors, and were invited to sit and start. There was some conversation about who I was, and what we were doing. I explained I was from California, and wanted to take them to get their nails done. After establishing who I was a where I was from, the people doing the pedicures continued to talk to each other, and every so often \""California\"" would pop out in their dialog with each other. This made it uncomfortable for us as we knew we were being talked about, but not talked to.\n\nThe conversation: \nWhile I was sitting there with my feet in the water, I explained I wanted a manicure, also. I said, \""Just a manicure, no nail polish.\"" Mia (I think that was her name) said, \""$37\"" (pointing at one granddaughter), \""$37\"" (pointing to the other granddaughter) and \""$47\"" (pointing to me). I went into shock thinking, \""Holy cow, what the heck is this place?\"" My mind was reeling with sticker-shock on this high-priced quote. My granddaughter mouthed to me, \""Did she say $37?\"" I nodded my head, yes. She was wide-eyed, also. I could not relax from that point on, nor could my granddaughter. It was like I was being financially raped. Mia kept asking me if it felt good while she was rubbing stuff on my legs. I was so consumed with the cost that all I could do was nod my head, and wonder why it was $37 to get a pedicure. The final insult was when she went to do my nails she whipped out a nail buffer, and started buffing without asking me. Then she says it will be $5 more. I did not even WANT my nails buffed. I have thin nails, and when you buff them, they fray apart. \n\nUpon leaving, my granddaughter asked the girl at the desk how much a pedicure is. She said, \""$23\"" (I believe) That was when I knew I had been taken advantage of. Mia did not offer the basic pedicure. She had only told us one option, and it was the most expensive. I believe this is bad customer service. My granddaughter is so upset; she does not want to go back there again for her brows. Both of my granddaughters insisted on giving me some money to compensate for the cost. That is NOT how that was supposed to turn out! \n\nI would NOT have posted this bad yelp if the owner had made it right, but I am writing this on April 23, 2014 and he has had plenty of time to respond. I cannot say that the pedicure was worth the price in any way. I was not happy with the actual pedicure work that was done, even if I was only paying the basic cost of $23.\n\nAll I can say is if a business practices these tactics, beware! Just look for better, more ethical places to clientele."
0,"I had lunch here Thursday. I have eaten here before and loved it but this time, not sure I would go back. The waitress came over to take our order and when I said I was going to order a salad but looked down at the menu she quickly said she had another table and would come back. Off she went. We had our water glasses refilled. The gal filled one glass over the top of one of our handbags, a Prada. She didn't seem to care and almost apologized as she casually went to get at towel but didn't hand us one. We cleaned up the water on the outside and inside of the handbag with our napkins. After searching for and flagging down the waitress to order our lunch, I ordered the mixed greens salad with turkey. The salad was ok but the turkey appeared to be packaged sliced lunch meat chopped into squares. It was awful. The bread on the salad was extremely tough and chewy. As we were eating, we watched, who I think was the manager, clean the lights over the bar as people sat there eating their lunch. The dust was flying everywhere and also landed on the bar. From our table we could see the dust because the bar was higher.  She didn't wipe the bar off but rather went around and began inspecting the clean glasses. One man was sitting there with his lunch and a glass of water. She cleaned the light next to him anyway. There also seemed to be something going on between two of the gals in the dining area. Not impressed this time around."

0,"There are very few bars in Lawrenceville that I have enjoyed to be honest.  Most are just filthy, dingy little rooms.  Belvedere's has the potential to be a great space, but it just looks like somebody's basement.  Having been there for about ten minutes, I had to get involved in a domestic dispute, because some lady spit on her boyfriends(?) face.  If you want to be a filthy dive bar, you should probably have a bouncer, but like I said, this place is just created of fail.  Shitty bartenders that are super full of themselves round out this piece of shit, dirty hole in the wall.  I'm still hoping my trip to the Round Corner Cantina is going to save my Lawrenceville review record."
1,"Very good burger at a great price.  It's wonderful to have the option to build your own with a good list of ingredients.  Fries and onion rings are tasty, and the chicken sandwich was well seasoned/tasted wonderful.  We will be back again."
0,"I guess Walmart moved its Yelp page?  So I'll move my prior review.  What can you say. There was a time when Walmart was an industry leader by using inventory control techniques that made sure they were always on top of supply and there stores always had what you were looking for. \n\nApparently inventory control, along with employee wages, and just employees in general, started cutting into the bottom line because Walmart has become the store Kmart became in the early 2000s. Understaffed by a bunch of people who are so underpaid they don't give a thought to doing a good job or caring to help anyone. The store looks like something out of a post apocalyptic movie with shelves half empty and disorganized. Some of the most basic items go unstocked for months.\n\nThe Maricopa Walmart is one of the worst I have encountered in Arizona. I know they have low prices, but even those have steadily increased in the last few years. Poor stock, poor appearance/cleanliness and an overall we don't give a damn attitude best sum up the Maricopa Walmart."
1,"If you like fresh and I mean fresh veggies, this is the place for you.\nIt is open on Saturdays and not all year round. But should be opening again soon. \n\nThey do not always have the same produce each week since they pick what is growing at the given moment. But it is always quality and this next bit is from his web site.\n\n\""Growing everything myself, the produce sold at my farm stand is chemical-free and better than organic. I use NO pesticides of any kind, NO insecticides, ZERO antibiotics, NO chemical fertilizers, and absolutely NO genetically modified organisms.

I put Phoenix so it would show up here."

0,"On two different occasions I have encountered two rude sales people at this store.  The first time I was checking out their dining room tables and had actually received a code to use online for 10% off.  I asked the lady if they would match it and she pretty rudely told me no, and that I am better off buying it in the store to keep the money local.  I explained to her that even with shipping/frieght charges the piece I was looking at was $180 cheaper.  Her reply was, well, it's only $180, just buy it in the store!  I was taken aback.  I don't have money to throw away, just because I was in Pottery Barn doesn't mean I have a money tree in my backyard.  Are the only allowed to shop here have a mon ey is no object attitude?  And let's not forget when I was looking at dining room table that was a floor sample and the sales lady said she would look for the leaf for it, but only if I was serious about buying it and walked off.  I have worked customer service for a long time in the past and just couldn't believe the attitude.  The second time I had to buy a dining chair because the Las Vegas store did not have the number of chairs I needed.  The sales people were again rude, like I was wasting their time by only buying one dining room chair.  It was Memorial Day weekend and we asked if they gave a military discount and they said no with an attitude.  We had just came from the Las Vegas store where they don't normally do discounts for military but the manager happily gave it to us and thanked us for our service.  I will drive all the way up to the Vegas store to avoid the attitude here."
0,Horrible service. Had to ask for someone to take our order after waiting 15 mins. Waited another 30mins for food to come out. Salad was soggy. Wish I would have walked to Subway next door.
1,"We found this on a business trip and loved it. 3 of us ordered the Living The Dream (LTD) platter, and one a half rack of ribs. \nThe LTD is a combo platter with chicken, pulled pork, ribs, and pot roast, with two sides. \nThe ribs were meaty and flavorful, just right. The chicken was moist, not dry. The pull pork was traditional. The pot roast was unique. I've had bbq brisket but never pot roast. It was a unique and delicious choice. \nEverything had a nice smoked flavor. \nThe portions were huge. No one could finish the LTD. I made a meal out of my doggie bag. \nThe salads were crisp and clean. The mac and cheese was great. \nThey had two sauces, a NC vinegar and a sweet mild tomato based. \nThe reataurant is a bar in a log building, a bit dark. We ate on the porch. \nTL; DR - great bbq, good sides, nice ambience. We will return."
1,"The ALMIGHTY buffet of all buffets in Las Vegas! \nIf you are into AYCE and you came to Vegas looking to eat, then this place is definitely a must try.  The only reason its 4 stars vs. 5stars is because I had to during dinner time and having to pay $50 really hurt my wallet. \n\nHowever, would i do it again?  Probably would.  Why? Because this buffet is definitely aesthetically pleasing in their presentation and layout.  Not every item was a scoop and serve feel but some were plated and decorated so beautifully it was hard eating it because it was pretty (such like the watermelon feta salad in a chess square formation)  \n\nAlso, this is one of the few buffets in my list that do not skimp on the QUALITY vs quantity.  It might be a buffet but each dish definitely tasted fresh and flavorful with all quality meats and produce. \n\nI'll be visiting this buffet very soon as this buffet is one of the top on my list. \nOthers include: Wicked Spoon, M Resort Studio buffet, and Bellagio (in no particular order)"
0,"I am leaving this store angry and can't resist writing a review! \n\nThe staff is incredibly useless....if you can actually find someone to help you. The store is huge with very little signs to guide you. Therefore I always wander aimlessly looking for the one simple thing I stopped in for (even though I tell myself I will never go back) with no one to help me. \n\nToday they were out of an item I bought last week and need more of to finish my project. I asked the only 100 year old lady I could find to check the back and she told me they have nothing in back and to ask customer service. The lady at customer service was actually a reasonable age and when I asked her to call the Indian Bend store she handed me their number and said \""well you can call them\"". I stormed out soooo mad and this time I promise to never go back. Hobby Lobby or Michaels is worth the drive!!!"
1,"Sat at the bar for drinks. Rock Daddy was playing, not too bad of a band (80s and 90s rock). Went outside to sit and people watch for a little bit since there are tables right on the Strip. Too cold, so went back inside. Surrounding people were all very nice. The bartenders were all really cool, too. Generous pours , huge shots, and not ridiculous prices for drinks. \n\nSome people were still ordering food even though it was late. I did not try the food but the smell of all of the fajitas when they were brought by started to make me nauseous. \n\nSupposedly all of the bands have to play Sammy songs as part of their sets. It's a requirement to play there. The only song I heard when I was there was \""Can't Drive 55\""."
1,"Gina - the manager, great service. Food came out as expected for a few of us, one party did not like their fish with skin, so Eric, our server fixed it."
1,"This is a phenomenal place for a nice dinner and some drinks.  I would definately go back just for a happy hour.  Lately I have been craving fruity drinks/cocktails.  We asked for a cocktail list and honestly everything sounded delicious.  I went with the Crushed Berries cocktail.  I can't stop thinking about this drink.  The drink was made with Cirroc Berry Vodka, fresh crushed blueberries, lime and syrup.  It's a good thing I had made a reservation or I may not have made it to dinner. This cocktail was just what I needed and we were celebrating my boyfriend's birthday.  For dinner we shared a Ribeye, garlic whipped potatoes, and the macaroni and cheese.  Our ribeye was cooked perfectly.  We both like our steaks rare and it isn't easy getting a steak the way we like it.  The macaroni and cheese melted in my mouth, it was THAT GOOD!"
1,"This was one of only 3 post offices out until midnight to pick up those taxes.  I was happy to see I wasn't the only one taking advantage of it.  Yea, yea, I'm normally better than that.  But this year The Girlfriend owed some, and rather than paying to e-file for both of us at $17 a pop times 4 (that's almost $70) I'd make the run to a post office and give her the cash instead for Uncle Sam.\n\nBut anyhow - we made the drive there and as we were in the turn lane to go on Van Buren when suddenly a big guy pushing a cart comes running up to our car, looking half out of breath, followed by a guy wearing an official polo and lainyard w/ id kind of thing, and then a woman with one of those orange traffic vests and a cop.  He gestures to open the window and then it hits me that I recognize the cart. He's collecting mail.  As I lower the window he yells \""Is it already stamped?\"".  When I say yes he reaches out his hand and, trusting the guy with the id, the cop and the every so official looking orange vest, I decide to give him our taxes.  He then makes the trek to the car behind me.\n\nBravo USPS!  You are already working late, and working hard as this is one of your busiest times of the year.  But then you go and actually think about your customers enough to have someone waiting before a main turn to eliminate a good chunk of the traffic that would be coming into your location.  Totally made for an easy mail drop experience.  \n\nWe celebrated by getting ice cream at Dairy Queen.  Thought about bringing something back for our little tax day Village people group on the street, but figured they couldn't really do their jobs well with sticky hands from that dipped cone.  But we totally give ya props."
1,These guys are RADICAL and very community minded!  They have some some amazing tings for Ear Candy and Local First while exceeding expectations in a tight time frame!\n\nYou won't be disappointed!
0,"I have never written a review for yelp, so this would be the first time only because i think this place sucks donkey dick, the bathroom was the worst part of the restaurant and was disgusting, it was hot with no a/c so i was sweating while i was eating, the food was not that great, i seen a fly on the food, the ice cream sucked, and they overcharged us. I will never go back to this place. I'm very disappointed."
0,"We went for lunch. The appetizer was fantastic, but it rapidly went down from there. I had a turkey sandwich and I swear the bread was contractor grade. I mean seriously, if I were building a new house this stuff could be used to construct the foundation. I mentioned it to the waiter 3 (!!!) times and he still didn't offer anything to fix it. I finally had to say \""Hey, can't you do anything about this?\"" His \""manager\"" comp'd me a slice of cheesecake, whoop-dee-doo. The tab was over $100 for myself, wife, and our three kids. That free slice of cheesecake sure helped! Bottom line is, we will NOT be going back even if it's free!"
1,"This place is tucked in the corner on the opposite side of the street from Desert Ridge's main shopping complex (next door to Pita Jungle). We headed here for breakfast since we have been meaning to try this place for some time.  Right away we were greeted by a server and seated in a nice booth.  There are only about 20 seats in the place, so I'm sure it fills up on weekdays with all the businesses in the same lot. We were fortunate that it wasn't slammed when we went.  \n\nWe both chose to get the special of the day, which was the ham steak plate (see picture).  The portion was huge!  The ham was delicious, the potatoes were cooked just right and the eggs were made to order - he had scrambled, I had over-medium.  Luna was one of the servers working that morning and she stopped by to check on us and we struck up a conversation.  She was extremely nice and we felt really welcome the entire time we were there trying to finish up our monster plates of food.\n\nThey also have a frequent eaters card that you can build up points on and perhaps get a free breakfast! They are free and you don't have to fill out any paperwork or anything, so grab one up when you go.\n\nOverall: A\nWe will definitely be back to this cafe and fingers crossed they have the ham steak special running again when we do!"
0,"After reading the reviews here on yelp we were pretty excited to try this buffet.  Well it was a big disappointment.  If you only want something fancy to look at this place is for you.  Many of the items are very uniquely displayed in little pots, or basket.  Otherwise, my advise is to skip it.  The food wasn't very good.  Nothing was labeled, and there wasn't as many choices as most of the buffets on the strip.  The line for the omelet bar was about 20 minutes long.  They also had some breakfast taco, but no sour cream."
0,"What a disappointing and enraging experience! I was in Vegas for a bachelorette weekend o' fun and our group of ladies was given VIP passes to Haze (with the added enticement of seeing Katy Perry preform that night). I have done my share of clubbing in Vegas and know to expect to feel like a sardine in the more posh 'places to be', but even in those places, you are treated well by the staff. The staff at Haze were incredibly rude!\n\nMy experience at the bar left me feeling abused and broke. It took the bartender 30 minutes to serve two $28 shots. When my friend went back to order 4 drinks (two vodka crans and two vodka tonics) the bartender poured and charged her for 8 drinks (4 of each). Upon correcting him the bartender called my friend a liar and refused to take back the drinks or own up to his mistake.\n\nKaty Perry went on nearly two hours late. It was fun to see her preform, but you can imagine my disappointment when she only sang two songs before bolting.\n\nThe music was good, the layout was mediocre, and the staff ran the joint without common sense or good customer service skills (like intrusively wiping up a splash of a drink on the floor and revving the towel into our feet). Haze felt like a club that just opened and would fizzle out after the initial hype. I always go back to places where I am treated well, and not to places where customer service is forgotten and the institution expects clientele to feel grateful for maltreatment or privileged just for being let in.\n\nAfter Katy Perry's brief show, I took my business elsewhere and traded my heels for flip flops.\n\nTotally not worth it! Oh, and only old dudes can afford to get in - so be ready for some wrinkled hands trying to feel up your junk, ew."
0,Too expensive for what it is....but then it's on the mt so they bump prices up for the tourists. The fries are incredibly salty almost inedible.  Good for tourists not locals
0,"Beautiful atmosphere and great service. Unfortunately, the food was not up to the same standards.\n\nWe walked in on a Monday night and the place was largely empty, which worked well for us. We sat outside on the patio, which was well lit and nicely appointed with a great view of the restaurant itself. Our waiter was very friendly and helpful.\n\nI ordered the Deep Sea Red Crab Cakes to start, and really admired the flavors. The crab cakes were well cooked, and the red pepper aioli added an unexpected but delicious kick. Unfortunately, there was just far too much aioli on the plate, making it the star of the dish, not the crab itself, as it should have been.\n\nAs it was quite late, I decided to skip an entree and just order another appetizer as my main course. The butternut squash gnocchi with pecan pesto and brown sugar sauce sounded amazing, but it was probably the worst thing I have ever eaten in a restaurant. The gnocchi seemed to have been deep fried, so they lacked that soft, melt-in-your-mouth taste that I love in gnocchi. They were chewy and meaty - in fact, when I passed one to my husband, he asked, \""What kind of meat is in this?\"" The \""sauce\"" was a very light slop that did little to mask the texture of the gnocchi. I actually had to stop eating because I thought I was going to be sick if I put another one of those gnocchi in my mouth.\n\nPerhaps I just didn't order the right things at Citizen, but I can honestly say I will not be returning for another go."
1,"I've only been to Brio for special occasions. The first was my 21st birthday, the next was the night I got engaged, and the last was for dinner after my husband and I had our civil wedding.\n\nBrio does special occasions like a buncha pros. On my birthday, they made me feel so special, with a free dessert that said \""Happy 21st\"" and a coupon for a free appetizer on my next visit. We didn't get engaged until after dinner, so they didn't do anything for that, lol. But it was still a really romantic date (as far as I knew at the time!) Then, for our wedding dinner, it was me and my husband and our parents, and they really went out of our way to make it a celebration. The waiter was so friendly, and we got an entire dessert sampler complimentary. My husband was wearing his dress blues since we came straight from the wedding, and the staff was thanking him for his service, which we thought was cute.\n\nBottom line, I love this restaurant. Eat here!\n\nFoods I love: the spicy shrimp and eggplant appetizer is to die for, the caesar salad isn't too anchovy-tasting, and the mushroom ravioli is my favorite dish. :)"
1,Really enjoyed our meal here. Tried the Banh Mi and it was super tasty. Value was amazing as well. Vietnamese iced coffee was to die for.
1,"This is a great bar.  I love the fact that you sit in an open circle providing ample opportunity to people watch the high end shoppers.  Good service and great selection of whiskey, bourbon, gin, and other yummy distilled treats."
1,these macron's are amazing and there custard stuffed croissants are sooo good too. \n$1 a piece for the macrons \n$2 for a croissant
0,"This buffet was awful.   We went here for a quick dinner and the first sign of how bad it was was the lack of people in line!   We finally pay via an atm machine and then we get to the front of the line and they make us wait more!   There again were NO people in line and plenty of open tables.   \n\nThe food was downright bad.   I enjoy food and i love good buffets but in a city of many buffets this was poop.   The only positive in the WHOLE place was desset.   The chocolate fountain was excellent and the things to dip in it were good.   Cotton Candy is also good.   But the other food was the reason for the terrible review.   Fried chicken that's not good, steak that is poorly done, a dirty presentation and bad chinese....so many negatives and not enough positives in this town of buffets."
0,"The single worst pizza I've ever had in my life!  (See photos).  It was impossible to eat, and I can't believe a restaurant would serve what they did.  Seriously, when this place is closed soon, I will not be surprised.\n\nThe first warning sign:  There were only 4 customers in the entire restaurant when we walked in.  There were 11 people behind the counter working.  It was weird... they were all kind of just standing around, and a few of them were just watching others work.  Restaurants that aren't busy (and are empty) are usually like that for a reason.  We soon learned why.\n\nThe pizza I ordered was a pepperoni, olive & pineapple.  The woman making it was nice, but I have to admit the pizza didn't even look all that great when it was being made.  She used very few ingredients, it seemed.  For roughly $15 for a personal size pizza, it seemed average at best while it was being made.\n\nI got to the cash register to pay, and a new cashier was being trained that day.  It took quite a bit longer than I expected.  As I looked around, I'm thinking now that maybe even the cooks and prep people were being trained as well.  There were what appeared to be a few managers just standing around watching them like a hawk.  It was odd.  Three months into a new restaurant, I would've expected things to be running smoother.\n\nThe pizza arrived.  The edges were black on the crust and I like them that way.  However, a closer glance revealed that the entire interior of the pizza was either undercooked or uncooked.  Picking up the first slice, it was clear that the thing was a complete mess.  The entire pizza toppings slid off, including cheese and everything.  I was left holding a wet piece of literally uncooked dough with some tomato sauce.  It was a rubbery mess and the entire middle of the pizza was drowned in wetness and was more of a soup than a pizza!  The whole thing was gooey, wet and runny.  The crust was so thin and undone that it was a drooping disaster.  Each slice was like that:  watery, dripping, and unable to even stand up like a normal pizza slice.  \n\nIt was inedible.  Before I left, I scooped some of the soup-like toppings on a fork, and it didn't even taste good.  The crust had no flavor at all.  I will never be back, and would implore anyone reading this to think twice about ever stepping foot in this place.  There's a reason it ended up on one of the lower-end Vegas properties like Monte Carlo rather than someplace like the Cosmopolitan, Aria or Caesar's Palace.\n\nEat at this place at your own peril.  I'd give it zero stars if I could."
1,"I was really disappointed when Dozen closed up shop in Squirrel Hill so I was thrilled to discover this place today. I got a pumpkin spice cupcake. The cupcake itself was dense, but moist. The icing was light and fluffy, but a tad sweet than I prefer. I will definitely go back and try some other flavors. \n\nOn the Pittsburgh cupcake scale, I'd say they were better than Dozen, but not as good as Vanilla Pastry Studio. I've never tried the other place in Shadyside."
1,"Great dinner again tonight, had the 2 meat combo of Ribs and brisket. Not as \""off the bone\"" as before but still effing delicious. Owner is there today and he is very friendly and is on top of everything. As soon as your drink runs out he will be refilling it mean while bringing you some extra napkins.\n\nTheir old tv is gone, I asked him and he told me they have wall mounts set up ready for a new flat screen TV. Nice upgrade!\n\nagain, you can BYOB."
1,I'm a picky eater and and thought the steak fundido was great.  Order a Boss margarita with this and you are guaranteed to enjoy your experience.  I would have given them 5 stars but the wait was frustrating.  We were told 20 minutes which really ended up being almost an hour.\n\nOne of their bartenders was our waiter and he did a great job turning our frowns upside down.
0,"my husbands and mine  first time in vegas and as far as the hotel Goes, its great. My negative,which is a serious deal\nBreaker for me is when something is not clean-(because i do hair, i  am licensed to touch, meaning i had to learn about ALL infection and sanitation and how to avoid spreading infection etc....) Once i walked in the bathroom i looked at the towels and saw light yellow crusty residue on the towel!!! I know what it is, just didnt want to say (barf) But looking at all the towels i could clearly tell, either the temperature on their dryers are not hot enough to kill bacteria. Or someone's not doing their job washing them with rthe correct temperature water :/ they did fix it after i called them but i was honestly disgusted. The headboard has wierd stains on it- just want to tell the housekeepers to pay extra attention and CLEAN!!!!  not just surface cleaning- but sanitize!! I hope the hotel teaches them about sanitation and disinfection. The tubs, the sheets, everything! It needs it. Our remit control also doesnt work. Womp."

0,"This store is farily new to the premium outlets. The store isn't real clean. There are items sitting on the floor and hanging off of racks.  Shoes aren't in boxes. THey are torn up and had been torn through. Handbags were hung on racks, sitting on shelves, and some were wrapped in full zips along the walls. The sales staff looked at me, up and down at least twice, and didn't say a word. I didn't even get a \""Hi\"" out of them or anything. There are some items thatr I was interested in here but considering they weren't willing to ask if I needed help even, I didn't stick around. I found some real good buys. I found a pair of real cute ballerina shoes for $39 and a purse for $110-120.  Jewelry is pulled out of the boxes and have been scattered all over the case.  I was upset by this and just left. If I'd been assisted, I would have for sure purchased at least 3 items, a shirt for Kaelani, a pair of shoes for me, and this cute pair of boxers that I saw for Walter. Too bad!!"
1,"Very good Italian food!! Don't waste your time standing in line downtown Phx for over an hour for even better pizza here. Lasagna, speghetti...everything is packed with flavor. They may want to make sure the music is suitable for the setting of romance or family dinners...one day a staff member had rap on. Will come back though!"
1,"LOVE THIS VENUE!\n\nThis is a review for the venue not the restaurant.\n\nThis is one of my favorite concert venues in Las Vegas. I have seen too many shows to count starting from when I was in high school over 10 years ago. The thing I love about it here is you are able to see the stage from pretty much anywhere and most shows are general admission. It's a small venue which makes it easier to see bands up close. I used to get up in the crowd when I was younger. Ok, I'm not that old now but I enjoy hanging out near one of the side bars drinking a tall boy and watching my favorite bands at the same level. \n\nThe beers are overpriced but really not that bad. They have a wide selection of tall boys and even offer a $5 dollar shot of anything when you purchase one of the tall boys. Mich Ult with shot of Jameson. Yes please! Recently they started serving snack like food in the venue which is nice if you plan on staying a while and drinking. I actually haven't tried any of it since I love going to the Burger Bar before or after shows. \n\nWhenever I hear that one of the many bands I enjoy is playing at HOB, I get really super excited. The only gripe is that the tickets are managed by Ticketmaster which charges ridiculous fees but that's just something we all have to deal with."
1,Their flavors are creative and delicious.  The cupcakes were moist and the texture was wonderful.  They recreated the logo of a friend's company at their launch party using the cupcakes and it was spot on.  The cupcakes were a hit.  Especially the margaritas.
0,"I love small business... so I'm always disappointed when I can't give a rave review. We went to Hillside Spot after a race (running) so we were starved. I went to the counter and ordered an OJ and pancakes. They took our order quickly and gave us a number for the table. It took about 15 minutes, but they brought us the plates of food... but no drinks. The employee said \""it's by the register.\"" So, I went back inside, grabbed an OJ out of the cooler (wish the person taking our order would have mentioned that) and went back outside. As I sat down to eat my pancakes (again, I was starving), I noticed that there was no silverware. So, I went back inside and noticed it was on a separate table behind the cash registers.... again, I wish they would have mentioned that it wouldn't come out with the food. THEN, there was no syrup with the pancakes. So, I went back inside AGAIN and had to wait for someone to pour me syrup into a cup and they even got the syrup all over the outside of the cup, which I had to carry back outside. Finally, I was able to sit down and eat. The pancakes were good, but nothing to get super excited about. They definitely filled the void- just glad they weren't cold after I had to run back inside 3 times to get everything I needed. \n\nNot impressed with the employees- they didn't do a single thing to go out of their way to make this an exceptional experience. If they would have told me about the OJ at the register and checked if we needed anything else when dropping off the food, I surely would have given this a better review. Hopefully they'll do better for future guests."
1,"Note: the museum is tiny, tiny, tiny.... You can see the whole place in less than an hour, easily, but it's definitely worth the trek to the northside.\n\nThis is a modern art museum, which definitely takes an interesting take on what modern art is (I guess modern art is always undefined, anyways). The top  floor holds the temporary exhibits, so it's nice to start there and work your way down. When I was there a couple months ago they had some massive wood sculptures carved from tree trunks and one big installation which was basically a big hole that overlooked the neighbor's backyard. Very interesting. \n\nMy absolute favorite thing is the light exhibits on the 2nd floor. Take your beau and grab on. It's terrifying and fun at the same time. The one exhibit takes about 15-20 to show-up, but definitely wait it out. It's worth it. Don't forget that there are 2 other buildings outside with more to see that only take a minute or two to see. \n\nFYI - there's no good way to get there via public transport, so hopefully you have a car."
0,Their kitchen closes way too early !  \nLay-out of the whole place isnt good and needs to be improved.\nThere simply is something wrong with the over-all lay-out of Marcel's that doesnt make you feel at home. \n                         Rest rooms arent maintained. Always strewn with paper all over. Everything inside is Boring and DULL!\nThe place needs MAJOR MAJOR SURGERY!\nMy guess is the business is probably out for sale. To say this place sucks is an understatement!
1,"Excellent gyro, fries, and tzatziki sauce, but the baklava was a little too cold like it was fresh out of the fridge though it tasted very nice. Would definitely return again :)"
1,I would have to say Fogo is in 2nd place. They have great service seated us quickly and the minute you turn over you're coasters to green the carvers are Right on it. The rack of lamb is outstanding but they don't serve seafood other than the smoked salmon at the salad bar that I thought could have been cooked longer and the shrimp cocktail wHich is not included in the price for dinner its only alacart. The selections at the salad bar could have been better.\n\nIn my opinion Fogo comes in second to Pampas because Pampas serves seafood (bacon wrapped scallops) their salad bar has more selections of hot items and they have this delicious grilled sweet pineapple. Only thing Pampas is missing is the rack of lamb.
1,"Oh so good and huge! Each sandwich is both tasty and large enough to feed two normal folks for lunch.\n\nAt the suggestion of the server, I ordered the Kolbassi Sandwich. It came fast and was oh so good! Also free soda refills.\n\nService was good mid afternoon on a weekday, and I enjoyed the whole experience watching the NFL Hall of Fame induction ceremony on the flatscreens while eating."
1,"Sunday, and the family wants to go on a picnic. Great.\nYou have a couple of choices.\n\nFeign some sort of non-specific illness so you can sit home and watch Red Zone Channel, or tag along and act like a good parent for a change.\nYou choose the latter.\n\nThis was the drill.\n\nI called in a takeout order at Poncho's, picked it up, then drove the entire crew up to Dobbin's Lookout atop South Mountain. (About a 10 minute drive from Poncho's on Central Avenue)\n\nYup.\nA seven-mile vertical drive up South Mountain chocked with enough mountain switchbacks to ensure your entire family will be car sick upon arrival, leaving most, if not all of Poncho's feast available for your lunch tomorrow.\n\nHey, I didn't do this on purpose, things just worked-out in my favor for a change."
1,"The best thing about this place is the music....the food is good and inexpensive but if you like good, classic jazz music this is the place. No cover or minimums; no pretentious people just come and enjoy!"
1,"Best buffet hands down!!\n\nI love healthy eating, and I also love buffets. This is the best of both worlds for me.\n\nThe salads and topping always taste fresh and the soups are always very tasty. I love how they rotate specialty items every week it seems so you get to try new soups, salads, desserts and more. \n\nYou could eat super healthy here, but you can also fill up to the point that you need to be rolled out very quickly. Even the kids plate you can get for the little ones has more than enough room for plenty of food. \n\nAs far as this location specifically, it is my favorite. They recently remodeled not only their decor, but their overall operating structure in general. Definitely a vast improvement to what they were and compared to some of the other Sweet Tomatoes locations. Sine the change, I have not had a bad experience here."
1,"Nice open space for large groups. It's much cleaner than the original one in Brooklyn and they don't serve soda in a bottle which is good. \n\nI split a large garlic white crust with fancy olives, mushrooms, and mini pepperoni. It was plenty of pizza for two dudes. The small salad was a big proportion too. \n\nMy advice, eat it fast! Don't wait because the texture gets a bit rubbery.\n\nEveryone should try a New York pizza."
1,"What a great place this is. It has a home feel to it. The service is spectacular and the food is just as good. On top of the food and service, Montesano's is a big supporter of the community and it's schools. Three years in a row, they have sponsored my schools yearbook. Great pizzas. Great bread and garlic knots. Overall, just a really great place. Do yourself a favor and become a regular. Don't forget to try the cannoli."
0,"First time here. A bit pricey for Italian, but you can sense the prices when you first enter and eyeball the upscale decor. $26 for veal dishes, tasty but small portions. They are very accommodating for substitutions. Potatoes can be changed for a variety of pastas without an additional charge. My wife's veal piccata was not that tender and a rather small portion. Same with the veal saltimboca, although tasty. Service was very good; professional, not pushy and sufficiently laid back when needed.\n\nI did hear the lucnh buffet was very good; both pricing and food selections."
1,"The Signature is one of the few places in Vegas that is a true hotel.  The hotel features three seperate towers, all with suite sized rooms.  The rooms feature possibly the most comfortable beds of any hotel, and a massive living space for you to enjoy during your stay (kitchenette, living room, desk).  The Signature is attached to the MGM Grand via several moving sidewalks, and is a nice way to get away from all the crazyness of dinging slot machines and smoking grandmas on the strip, while still being right in the middle of the lights.  It's truly an Oasis of luxury in Vegas.  You will not be disappointed here if you value relaxation and luxury over the mayhem of tables and slots."
0,"This is normally our fav place to eat - normally good sushi and great crab legs. Normally... last night EVERYTHING had been out for too long. The sushi rice was hard, the crab meat was grey inside the legs. Service at the table was great, but the food was horrible!  We likely won't return."
1,"This place is wonderful! Great food, friendly employees, and I love the environment. My sister and I go here any chance we get! Highly recommend this place."
0,"I have literally cried over this meal 3 times in the past 24 hours. Maybe a little dramatic, but I had huge expectations. I may very well be Gordon's biggest fan. When I was planning my October vacation I specifically chose Vegas just so that I could have dinner here! To say that it was a let down is a huge understatement. \n\nWhen we arrived I was blown away by the entrance and the decor of the restaurant. It's beautiful! We sat at the bar for a drink and then were escorted to our table upstairs. I should note that I made reservations several months in advance. They really do fill up, so know that planning well in advance is necessary here. \n\nI knew it would be a long relaxing dinner. I was excited for the whole experience. This was just slow though. We sat at the table a good 15 minutes before anyone approached us. I was dying of thirst! Don't get me wrong, our server was wonderful. I just feel like they have things set up for the meal to last at least 3 hours. I was falling asleep at the table. \n\nThe presentation of the steaks is really cool. I've never seen anything like it. My mind was made up months ago though. I knew I was getting his signature beef wellington. It would be a decision I would live to regret. \n\nI started with the onion soup. It was really good, but not hot! I got the feeling it was not served to me right away. It was almost as cool as room temperature. My friends soups/salads were served perfectly though. The salads looked to be the way to go. \n\nThe beef wellington was awful! I ate about 25% of it and then threw in the towel. I guess I'm just not a fan of the baked meat? It was tender but I just couldn't get over the off taste of it. It literally tasted like I came home from work and threw a piece of meat in my oven. The pastry fell apart and didn't stay on the meat. I'm not sure how it's supposed to be though. I just sat there wishing I had grabbed a slice of pizza for dinner instead. \n\nWe did a side of saut\u00e9ed spinach and the brussel sprouts. Both were good. Those are hard to screw up though. I do regret not trying the Mac and cheese. That sounded good. \n\nI had been looking forward to dessert here for months! Timing was an issue on this one though. By the time we were offered dessert we were ready for bed! No joke. I couldn't keep my eyes open. We had a cup of coffee attempting to gain some energy back, but threw in the towel and went to bed. \n\nIn the end I received over a $400 bill for a dinner I didn't enjoy. The staff is friendly and all had wonderful personalities. At least I have that memory. I won't be making the mistake of ever going back."
0,"Disgusting \n\nDon't expect customer service. \nDon't expect employees to stop their personal conversations with each other.\nDon't expect employees to look you in the eye as you are paying for an item. \nDon't expect employees to have manners, not even the most basic manners.\n\nDo expect to have employees ignore you as you are paying for an item at the register.\nExpect employees to stand in an isle yelling rules that will never pertain to a self respecting customer.\n\nGoing to Last Chance would be less painful if the employees had an ounce of class.  Buying a used $600 purse is already a cockamamie idea. But to have the sales person be outright rude to you as you pay for that bag or any other item for that manner is just beyond ridiculous. Used crap is clearly worth much less than new merchandise. Last Chance should be so lucky to accept money for the used crap people return to Nordstrom. \n\nAfter my terrible experience at Last Chance I would rather save my money and deal with polite and classy sales people to purchase necessary items at a higher price.\n\nNordstrom, I am very disappointed in you. Your employees should provide the same level of customer service at all locations that represent the Nordstrom name."
0,"I went to this location, late night around 3am, and left the drive thru window around  3:30am. The clerk was chit chatting with his friends/family member for almost 30 mins. Cars were lined up, and waiting. Late night service was an absolute disaster."
1,"Great service., healthy as always."
1,"The Griffin has always been a favorite of mine since it opened years and years ago.  Before all these other cutesy places started popping up and it was only the Griffin, Beauty Bar and Downtown Cocktail Lounge, it was one of the few places in Las Vegas that reminded me of bars back home. The decore is pretty cool. You walk in and it is so dark inside, it looks like a dungeon.  There's a ton of brick, booths that sit around litte fireplaces, a juke box, and a looooong dark bar lined with bar stools.  It gets incredibly packed in here so the stools are kind of annoying to me because it encourages people to sit and makes it extremely difficult to get drinks from the bartender when it's busy.  All the way at the end of the bar, however, is the jukebox, and there's always a little opening there where you slide in to get the bartender's attention.\n\nThere's a back room with sofas and a small dance floor. The only time I've gone back here is when they've had a DJ who plays house music and people are crazy!  It's great people-watching.  I've always had a great time here and drinks are fairly priced.  It's a good place to meet locals and mingle, or to go with a bunch of friends and just get bombed."
1,"I love this gun store.  Too bad it's on the other side of town.  I came here to shop for optics for my AR-15 and ended up learning much more.  The people here are super cool and approachable.  If you're a beginner or an advanced shooter, they will help you find what you need.  They don't make you feel stupid if you ask a million questions.  A+ on customer service.\n\nI ended up purchasing a Trijicon ACOG, which set me back some bucks...but it was worth every penny.  I also learned a lot about suppressors.  They almost convinced me to buy one...LOL\n\nTheir pricing on Glock 19 Gen 4's are some of the best in the city.  It's too bad I already owned 2, otherwise I would've bought one from them.\n\nI highly recommend this place if you're a novice firearms owner or thinking about buying your first firearm.  They'll help you navigate through all of the factors to consider.\n\nReturn Factor - 96%"
1,"The Griddle has a HUGE menu, so be prepared for that when you arrive.  My friends and I dined on a Sunday evening and had no problem walking up to get a table.  There's not a TON of variety anywhere on the menu except the pancakes.  The dining room is comfortable and really cuts off the casino floor noise, despite being directly next to it.  My friends and I ordered a mix of breakfast (omelette) and lunch/dinner (fish tacos and shrimp pesto sandwich) items and were definitely satisfied.  The only thing I would have enjoyed is more flavor in the omelette and accompanying breakfast potatoes.  Our server seemed a bit off her game, but we all have off days, so we wrote that off.  If you're looking for a unique dining experience in a Strip casino, check out The Griddle.  I'm sure you won't be disappointed!"
1,"Lux!  What a place!  Their coffee drinks are addictive and rapturously good. From their coffee to their chai teas to their lemonade. Don't even get me started on their baked goods!  The pastries are masterpieces and consistently delicious. The staff are friendly and invested in every customer who walks into the place.   The live DJ cannot be beat!  Finding a spot to lounge can get tricky at times because it does get crowded but one can't blame others for wanting to be there to enjoy the coffee, food and ambiance."
0,"Not good, overall just not good. We had a large group and our poor server seemed so overwhelmed. She actually did a good job getting everyone's orders but then who knows what happened in the kitchen. Half the table never got any food at all, some of us decided not even to order entrees because it took so long for anything to come out. I did get to eat the gravy fries which were actually very tasty. A little too much salt but still liked it. The Mac n cheese was side order size and something I could have made myself. It was decent but nothing to get excited about so whoever wrote the menu is just really good about describing things in a fanciful way. \n\nNow the chicken tenders. I heard the waitress telling someone else that they were so popular they made an adult version. I love chicken tenders so I ordered them. It was like cardboard microwaved chicken. Took 2 bites and sent it back. I was in shock. Chicken tenders are usually so good to me because of the different ways that restaurants bread and fry em up. The tots were like what you get at elementary school lunch. I'm sorry union but for kids maybe okay, the only adults who would eat that are ones who are too drunk to notice what you just put in front of them. \n\nLocation and decor is great. Figure out your kitchen timing, revisit some of the menu items and this place could be really successful."
1,"Yes, I am a huge fan of this place. Been there a few times and plan on going again. However, I was pretty disappointed in the response the server and bus boy had in DUMPING an entire bowl of soup all over two out of three people in our party. They destroyed my friends beige suede pumps and my boyfriend had what looked like puke all down his pants and shoes. It was pretty disastrous and their response was \""I'm sorry, here's a towel\"". Kind of odd but then I realized two of us had a groupon so I'm sure they figured all was good since we got a deal. Bad form on their part but like I said I love that place still. The food is amazing and it's a really fun place. Watch out for that clumsy bus boy though...."
1,"It is so worth it to come in on a Sunday night to hear the Acoustic MadMen. I am biased, though...\n\nThis is a fun place to stop in or spend the evening if you like the music.  The alcohol is reasonable priced, the food is quite good, too.  My favs being Guiness (24oz) and the Bananas Foster to drink and burgers & the truffles fries for nomming.  Some exceptional items are:\n\n- Truffles Fries: \""...tossed with white truffle oil, Parmesan cheese & fresh parsley.\"" Contains no truffle, though still quite good.  (Google \""white truffle oil\"" and you'll be a bit shocked)\n\n- Prime Rib Sliders served with blue cheese & horseradish sauce.  Cooked to your temp & generally great beefy flavor with just enough bite that you don't eat the entire beef slice in your first bite. \n\nI typically go late on weekends which can be quite busy, so service does degrade a bit.  Lunch service has been good so far. \n\nGo for 2 Timin' Tuesdays for 2for1 burgers.  Eat one there & get the other to go, even!\n\nI am a repeat customer due to my preference for music, but would easily go there for the food & semi-Irish atmosphere, too."
0,"Dinner on New Years Eve was inedible.  Started with the French Onion Soup, which was so salty we couldn't eat it.  This from a person who LOVES salt.  Ordered the special of Prime Rib.  It was pretty good, but the roasted potatoes and collard greens served with it were also too salty to eat.  Very disappointing.  This will be the very last time we go there. Have been disappointed before, but this was the end.  No more chances for Six Pence."
0,"This should be called the porn hotel.  Several of us were staying here for business.  We came to the conclusion over lunch that this is less than desirable for a business traveller hotel, unless you are a porn producer.\n\nFirst the entire hotel is dark!  Have they heard of 100 watt bulbs!   This is where ugly people go to screw.  \n\nThe rooms have the bed in the middle of the room.  This can be off putting to a business traveller.  But it allows for dramatic 360 degree views of the action.  Did I mention that the room was dark!!! Is makes it a challenge finding the bathroom in this goofy studio floor plan.  The closet is also hidden for those pornos that want to have the rapist waiting in the closet motif.\n\nDid I mention the music.  It is everywhere and loud!  It makes it difficult to have a conversation.  Oh yeah and it sounds like a porn soundtrack.\n\nThere are a few suggestions for improvement:  \n1.  All of the bell men should get 70s porn staches\n2.  They need the bell men to wear dress shirts unbuttoned to the navel over day old wife beaters."
1,"After two other locations near me shut down, I was forced to start frequenting this one. Dunkin' Donuts has been a staple in my family since I was kid and I cant get enough of their munchkins!\n\nThe service here is superb! I have never had any issues with any of the employees. The food is always great and they make my coffee just right!"
1,Very very help full. I tried a few flavors I ended up getting butter rum it was very good. Thank you George for all your help.
1,They have good local treats and the staff has always been good to me.
1,"okay wow this was amazing. first enjoy the scenery as you walk into this REALLY pretty hotel lobby. and just that alone was enough for my appetite. \n\nnext walk past the tables and enjoy the hotel. MAKE SURE YOU WEAR SLEEVES. nothing less than a tshirt or there is a 1299 FEE for a shirt. \n\n40$ for the buffet was to be expected so its fine.\n\nthe food selection is plentiful. and the quality of the food is amaze balls lol.\n\ni like to do a section at a time at the buffet so that im not so over whelmed, each section did not dissapoint at all.\n\nthe DESSERT MADE ME THINK I NEVER NEED to have sex again hahaha! okay maybe not soo dramatic but it was that good. def make a crepe! the selection isnt as big as the other buffets but its enough and THEY ARE SO GOOD.\n\nthe service was kind of slow for someone who only had a few tables but thats okay. im not expecting the waiter to be at my side the entire time.\n\na must go."
1,I was in the market or a new Computer and thought I would give them a try. I went in and talked to Mr. Cady about my options. He showed me some models that where out with Linix on them. I checked them out and was very impressed!!!! I did not know that with Linix you get free  software. So they built me a new computer that I have been using for about a few weeks and I could not be any happier. Thank you Redseven
1,"Strike the background music by the Commodores, \""Three Times a Lady\""...\""yes, you're once, twice, THREE times a laaaady. And I loooove youuuuu!\"" Yep. After C4. After The Clarendon Kitchen. We now have Gallo Blanco. And I am muy happy about this. The carne asada tacos are heavenly! Perfectly seasoned and served in the cutest taco rack. I'm now combing every William Sonoma to find these puppies. Our mango fresco juice beverage thingie was so refreshing I wanted to jump right in! Rickie said the roasted chicken was succulent. Ok. So he didn't say succulent. I think yummy was the word. The decor is modern and comfortable. I love how they really opened up the room. It is light, airy and has great views. Including our bedroom window...ooops...maybe I shouldn't have mentioned that. OMG. We just confirmed our trip to Disney World! Gotta go! Oh. Eat here. NOW!"
1,"Hey how is everyone?! I am just reviewing gordon ramsay's steakhouse in Las Vegas. I went here in July and I just want to rate my experience. I'm using the KISS method, please let me know if you like this style.\n\nK- the place is really clean, very immaculate and the decor was great. There was no dust in sight.\n\nI- the place was immaculate, the hostess was very accommodating and dressed in professional clothes. The waiter and the helpers really represented the restaurant well.\n\nS- the service was grade a awesome. They put the napkin on your lap when they seat you. They let you see what the steak looks like before you order it, kind of like a desert tray. The water that they used was in a wine type bottle, so they used grade a water. The wait time was exceptional, and everything came out at the right time. They were also very attentive to us and filled our water whenever it was empty.\n\nS- overall satisfaction was good. This review would have been 5 stars but the steak was dry and not juicy at all. It was kind of shocking, I had the filet mignon. All the sides were really good, they had a great alcohol selection too. \n\nOverall, this place was great, the steak was good but not as good as I thought but everything else was just perfect!"
1,"Delicious food, great service, wide variety of options on the menu. Good for vegetarians too. I am a fan of their Veggie burger and Evelyn's Favorite Pasta.\nThe complimentary bread is amongst the best too, definitely beats Olive garden, especially the brown one.\nI've tried only one of their chocolate Cheesecakes and I liked when when I began eating but it was too big for me to enjoy till the end. It would be a good idea to split a slice amongst two people.\nThis restaurant may seem a little pricey but the portions are big and the ambience and service easily make it worth it."
1,"I've only been here once it was, it was recommended to me by someone who frequents the place, I was not disappointed food I ordered was great and price was good!"
1,"Me and a group of friends came in after a game and had a blast. We loved the drinks made with different flavors of moonshine, my favorite was the Dolly Parton with the apple pie flavor.\n\nThe bartenders were really personable and attentive, they took great care of us.\n\nBeing new to the area, I really appreciate having a local place to go have a drink that isn't a chain restaurant! And a cool country atmosphere at that!\n\nI see a some negative reviews about the food but I would have to disagree. I had what I think is called Snake Bite pasta and it was spicy! Spicy but well made. \n\nThe only reason I didn't give it a full 5 stars is because they aren't open till 2 during the week. I can understand though, this area doesn't seem to a hotbed of late night shenanigans. But no biggie"
1,"I know what you're thinking... \""How can a grilled cheese food truck possibly receive 5 stars?\""\n\nAnd that's a fair question. My only response is that you need to try their menu and get back to me. Because this is by far my favorite food truck.\n\nI swoon at the thought of the leek and mushroom sandwich, or the one with smoked tomatoes, or the one with avocado and other green stuff. And it's not your average cheese that they're using. Their ingredients are strategically sourced to deliver an astounding flavor profile every time, with every sandwich.\n\nThere's a bit of a wait, which I count as a perfect opportunity to munch on the truffle potato chips. My only complaint about the chips is that they don't come in a 5 gallon bucket. So stinking good.\n\nI've tried a lot of food trucks in my day, but the quality ingredients, consistent vegetarian options and finger-licking good sandwiches at Papi Queso make it my top choice in town.\n\nAnd I bought a t-shirt. Long live the cheese stache."
0,If I could possibly give no stars I would. I have been to this location now two times. First time I had an appointment and I waited for 35 minutes with a 2 year old. This was the second time I went waited over an hour with a 2 1/2 year old and than was told they couldn't get me in today by Karen. Who is very unprofessional and no patients with small children anyway. This place is a joke. Wonder why I was told when I moved here NEVER to use this place. Now I will spread the word as well.
0,"I just did not have a great experience.  I didn't like the flavor of the hot dog (good snap, though) or chili.  The onion rings were pretty good.  The prices were crazy-high."
1,"We went to Le Chalet for dinner for my wife's birthday.  We got a standard cheese fondue and a steak fondue for dinner.  The cheese fondue was amazing!!  The beef fondue was good, but probably not something we'd get again.  The wine selection was excellent.  For dessert we had a couple of crepes, the lemon sugar and the salted caramel.  Both were good, but the salted caramel was great!  We would definitely go back!"
0,"You guessed it ... another Rent-a-Car centre one-star from this yelp.com user.\n\nThis is not isolated stuff here. \n\nEvery one of these companies at McCarran bait and switch, accept reservations (even pre-paid), and then do not honour. \n\nThe following is my firsthand experience with Thrifty:\n\nIt was late Thursday night. I guess it was during Spring Break (how this is germane is beyond me, but it was brought up by an employee). I had already been turned away by several McCarran companies, like E-Z, Firefly (rentals, not the restaurant with horrific health code violations), and maybe another. \n\nI quickly make a reservation on my fancy phone via carrentals.com. Just 15$/day, which seemed like a steal at the time, especially with my 12$/day pre-paid reservation at E-Z not being honoured, and enormous queues at Hertz and Payless, but when I reach the counter I am informed they have no cars. I can wait until 0400 -- I am told (it is 0030 at this point) -- or, I can accept a hook-up to an unnamed company (different from Thrifty) for fifty (50) dollars ($) a day. Fifty! \n\nYou see ... it was either agree to fifty a day or wait for four or more hours for a car. And this was some other company -- one that was never named -- that this Thrifty employee was referring me to. Paraphrasing here: \""If you walk up right now, it would be eighty a day. I can get your fifty because this is my friend and I will be sending you to them.\"" Later, she repeated this line, but mistakenly estimated the walk-up rate now to be ninety (90), because of \""Spring Break.\"" You can't make this shit up. \n\nAfter I say no, politely, I sit for about five minutes or less -- no bullshit -- and, the same employee tells me to head back to the counter because they had my car. The 15$/day car. My untested hypothesis is that it was there all along. \n\nIt had Colorado plates and was filthy, inside and out. I turned it in cleaner after the weekend than it was when dispatched to me."

0,"I took my 6 year old son here to visit his Mother after we divorced and it was daytime and I was spooked, as the sun went down I took him and left. The next time I told Mom that we would meet at Dennys from then on. It is scary and drug dealers live there. The bathroom is bigger than the room itself. Not all the people there are bad, some are good but are just really down on their luck. Some people even own cars there including a guy who owns a new looking white Ford F-350. Stay away from here if you know what's good for you. It is a last of the last resort place to live, not really a motel anymore."
0,How do you have a bad experience at a Nordy's? I thought that this was impossible. Let me preface this by saying that it wasn't really the Nordy's that bothered me so much but the MAC counter at Nordy's. \n\nI'll just sum it up in three sentences:\n\nOne....Absolutely could not keep their scheduling on point and caused my friend and I to be late to a wedding. Two....Rude and oblivious associates that would rather have you wait because they couldn't possibly take more than two appointments an hour even though they had a total of count them with me....eight people just standing around doing NOTHING. Three....Its quite apparent they have no appreciation or respect for their customers as I saw them make snide faces at their customers and rudely gossip about customers once they left. \n\nAwful and Absurd. Get a new set of associates for this location. \n\nI'm SOOO glad this is NOT my Nordy's. I'll never come to this location ever again.
0,"Waited in the drive through line for over 20 minutes behind one car. When I got to the cashier, I paid, and had to wait again.... Currently waiting on 3 burritos, all of which are the same. \nHow hard is it to make a burrito when you are a burrito store. \nAbsolutely insane that the worker didn't even apologize. \nNot worth the diarrhea"
1,"So, a co-worker of mine said that she had a taste for \""pide\"" and would I like to join her for lunch.  To myself, \""Um, what the heck is \""pide\""?  However, I told her, \""Yes, that sounds pretty good\"".  So down the street and around the corner and into a building tucked away on Fourth Street, Downtown, we go!  After giving the secret handshake and being sworn to silence, we enter what looks like a vacant space and order \""pide\"" (Turkish pizza).  OMG!  Who knew that anything like Turkish pizza existed?  It was so tasty!\n\nPide does not look like pizza; Shaped like a flat football with pinched ends and filled with eggs, cheese and spinach, it was unusual but wonderful.  My co-worker, who frequently eats vegetarian meals turned me on to this and I couldn't thank her enough.\nSince the pide was so tasty, I decided to try one of the Ephesus gourmet pizzas with kebabs.  You can order either chicken or lamb kebobs and I ordered half of each on my pizza.  I thought that they would slice the kebab meat and stick on the pizza, but no!  Each slice has its own kebab!  Yippee Skippee!  The best way to eat it is to hold the skewer inside the slice and then wrap the pizza slice around the kebab meat.  Mmmm Mmmm Good!\n\nEphesus' Downtown Pittsburgh location has since moved closer to PPG Plaza and more easily accessible, which is a good thing.  They also now have a location in Aspinwall which is closer to my home and boy am I glad.  I took a friend visiting from out of town there and he ordered the Moroccan Spiced Chicken and Dried Plum pizza.  I would have never associated those ingredients with pizza, but they were tasty too!\n\nDon't go there looking for fawning service or an elaborate atmosphere...It's not that place.  However, if you want to try delicious pizza with unusual toppings and an excellent crust, this is your place!"
0,"I've been here 3 times for a group happy hour. \n\nThe first time, it was excellent.  Had a great waiter who stayed on top of things and even came over to remind us about happy hour ending and to see if we wanted any more drink orders so he could get them in before the cut off.\n\nThe second time, it was a bit worse.  We had a large group, and took up the entire patio.  However, there was only 1 waitress for about 40 of us.  She forgot orders, brought out wrong things, and had no idea who ordered which thing.  She overcharged me too many drinks that had already been paid for.\n\nBut since they have decent food, and GREAT prices during happy hour, we decided to come a third time.\nApparently the manager didn't appreciate our business because he immediately asked when we would be leaving.  He said that we take up the entire patio and no one else can sit out there because we take all the seats.  Mind you, every single person there is a customer.  Every single one of us ordered multiple drinks and plenty of food.  It's not like anyone was just sitting taking a seat, but not paying for anything.\nThis manager was so rude, that my co-workers debated leaving right then.  We will definitely not come back again.  We also do a fund raiser with them and our school once or twice a year.  We are planning on canceling that.\n\nThey have lost our business now, which is unfortunate.\n\n\nIf you have a large group, go elsewhere.  If you are looking for cheap drinks, and there's only a few of you, this is an okay place.  The pretzels are cheap and okay, nothing special.\n\nMy major compliment is that they have Wyder's Pear Cider, which is my favorite!"
1,"Been twice, amazing and fresh homemade food every time, tried three total dishes in fact. This is the kind of hole in the wall neighborhood treasure that everyone always searches for. If they keep making food this good, it will need a larger dining area. The only possible improvement would be better silverware/plates/napkins but who cares about that!"
1,"Very helpful staff, clean and organized store, manager is walking around asking if anyone has any questions, and very busy! Their grooming area is great and the groomers really know what they're doing. This location also has pet adoptions every once in awhile outside, which is cool!"
1,"The Pork Empanada was AMAZING!  My mom & daughter both got the Bistec and it was wonderful!  Very tender and delicious beef.  The Cuban Sushi roll, Asian Tartare & Ginger Tataki were also very good.  The Sangria of the Day was ok.   We'll definitely go back.  A perfect place to stop before or after the theater."
1,"Yummm! Came for breakfast on a whim when in Vegas.  My friend had seen it on the tourism channel at the hotel.  We had about a 35minute wait, well worth it!  The food is huge - TOO huge, yes. BUT delicious! So often you got a lot and it sucks, but this was great!  We ate until we couldn't eat any more, but weren't sick, just super full.  Basically, we weren't hungry for about 8 hours! More time to visit!\n\nMy friend had the buttermilk pancake with toasted coconut - DELICIOUS! The pancake was HUUUUGGEE!\n\nI had the hash with artichoke, sun dried tomatoes, mushroom, and spinach.  It came with eggs (I had over easy) and a biscuit. I ate about HALF! \n\nMy gf had the hash with salmon and cream cheese; also YUM!\n\nIf I went back we would def split and get an extra biscuit. But for the quality and quantity, $14 bucks is not too bad! Also: lemonade and pineapple mimosas are YUM!"
0,"This store has the worst wc I have ever bin into in any grocerystore . I spoke to the storemanager about it he said it's ok , I  said let's go in to the wc , he said he doesn't need to . This guy is a fat basterd that doesn't give two shits about it . I can deal with it, but my daughters goes in to the wc some times , and the have to sit down . If the take care of this store like the take care of the restrooms, don't go there!!I have bin going to this store for 10 years I'm done. Go to smiths on rainbow !!!!"
1,"I've gone here countless times over the past year, and I have hardly been disappointed. The coffee is always wonderful (my favorite is chocolate hazelnut martini) and according to my sister the chai tea is the best she's ever had. If I lived closer, I would get a coffee from here everyday. \n\nI've eaten more breakfasts than lunches here, but it's great all the time. I do prefer the breakfast to the lunch, I feel like it is more expensive for lunch for the amount of food you get. Most of the time I get the eggs benedict, my eggs are always poached perfectly on top of ham and the hashbrowns, all over spinach which is my favorite touch. The fruit option as the side always has a great variety of different fruits, which I love! \n\nFinally, the owner is very charismatic and always greets his customers with a warm smile and converses with his regulars. \n\nA+ all around"
0,"Okay.. the good first: my partner really, really likes this place. It's the only pizza he eats, and pizza is pretty much his favorite food. He usually gets the thin crust/well baked sausage pizza, sometimes the deep dish, but for him, no complaints. So that's nice! \n\nThe bad: God, I fucking hate this joint. I don't like pizza, but their menu is big enough that when we do order in, I can try and get something new. Half of the time, they'll screw the order up. (Did I want a chicken parm with pasta? They send the sandwich. Did I want the chicken parm sandwich? They send the pasta.) Usually when this happens they'll send someone to fix their mistake - we've had quite a few times where they completely forgot half of our order - and that's pretty good of them. They always seem polite about it and service is fairly prompt.\n\nBut honestly the food isn't that good. It's greasy and bland and if I wanted mediocre Italian food, I'd make it myself. I'd say we go here once or twice a month, so this isn't a one-off thing - if  you like stuff that's bogged down with oil and cheese, great. If you want to taste what you're eating, well. Go somewhere else."
0,"Tasty food, super friendly and efficient staff, ice cold beer. Why only 2 stars then? Sewer problem, the bar had a very bad odor that the staff tried to mask it with a candle in the restroom and by opening the doors on a cold night.  Not the first time we've experienced this there. Hope it's fixed soon or we may have to find another watering hole- too bad."
1,"One of the best dance clubs I've been to in a long time.  Although the bar and seating areas were very crowded, I didn't feel closed in, unlike some venues.  The dancefloor is spacious and the dancers are hot."
1,"All the comforts of home... away from home, genius :) Parking underground confused me though, seems there is just 1 level w/ not too many stalls and 2 rows  that dead end, I ended up valeting.  The resort is right behind the Hawaiian marketplace, a short 2 min & ur on the strip.  The view from the room is gorgeous.  Our 1st stay here, will be back for sure!"
0,"Quite the adventure.  I had bought a Living Social and Gavin did my hair.  It came out fine (cut, color, and blow out) and since then I have been back three times.  The last time I went, I had an appointment and when I walked in, Gavin was working on someone else.  I waited twenty five minutes before it was my time to get my hair cut and colored.  Not even a sorry I am running late.  Two weeks ago I booked with Gavin for 9:00.  The day before my appointment I got a voicemail asking if I could come at 11:30.  When I called back I said I would change my appointment for then.  I was then asked if I could make it at 12:00.  I said yes.  Got there today and Gavin was NOT there.  First I was told he was out getting supplies, and then after 15 minutes I told Frank, the owner, that I was not going to wait anymore and leave.  He then told me that Gavin was on his way and had gone for therapy.  So which is it?  Supply store or therapy.  In any case, as I was walking out, Gavin showed up 20 minutes late.  I usually don't write bad reviews but I just wanted to warn others as this has got to be the most exasperated I have ever been at a hairdresser."
1,Great staff and food! Johnny and Erica took great care of us.... Laid back atmosphere and good food!
0,Cheap rent I like the wood floors the staff sucks so bad tho they are not on top of anything they add fees like its a game had to take it up with the corporate lady and she was extremely nice and understanding and refund us our money back ... But the staff that works there sucks and the manager on site is a hot mess and needs to be fired
1,I am so excited that we are going to Avanti again for our wedding anniversary! We have done this for years the food is superb and you will not find better service. The atmosphere is Art Deco and very elegant but very comfortable. My favorite restaurant!
0,"My boyfriend and I were looking to get away from the strip and wanted to eat somewhere the Vegas \""locals\"" do and found Swish through Yelp.\n\nPros:\n-Cheap Shabu Shabu\n-Friendly service\n-No wait\n-Open late! +++\n\nCons:\n-While the service was friendly, it was painfully slow at times\n-The meat was not fresh. By its dark red color, you could tell that it had been cut in advance and stored in the fridge before it was served to us.\n-The individual gas-powered shabu pot ran out of gas in the middle of my meal! It was a bit awkward having the server reach around and plug in a new gas can to have it re-start.\n\nIn the end, I felt our visit here wasn't worth our time. I wouldn't recommend it as a place to visit as someone from the area or not. Maybe I'm spoiled by all the shabu places in CA? Who knows...so sorry Swish :("
1,"Here Friday nights could be noisy for you, if you hate dance and music. Food is fresh and tasty. The PITA is AWESOME!"
1,"I have become a regular here recently. I have not met cooler business owners, especially ones who will go out of their way for customers. If that wasn't enough, the food is great! Water boiled bagels and amazing variations. Plus, this is the only place I can get vegetarian kimchi in a huge jar and/or on my bagel. Enjoy."
1,"You wont find many places to sit, don't expect wait staff, or cutlery, but the food is good, the service is personal.  Breakfast was tasty and filling"
0,This place is the slowest full service I have ever been too. And the wash tunnel did not even get all of the dirt off the car.  For $16 I could have done a better job myself.
1,Went there this past weekend and had Steak & Lobster. Really love the taste of the food and customer service was great.
1,"I have eaten at Lebanese restaurants around the world and can assure you that Kaza Maza ranks very close to the top, if not the top of this list. The menu is inventive and masterfully done. Try the three cold meze and choose the dishes made from beet and roasted red pepper (muhammara). I have not seen their like before. The lamb chops and kafte in pomegranate were incredible and full of flavor and texture. Trust the staff when they make suggestions, they know what they are talking about. This was one of the best meals I have had."
1,"Monongohela (if that's the way you spell it lol), is really beautiful and even the ride up is quite fun. It was my first time ever to the pittsburgh area and I gotta say this was an amazing way to see rhe beautiful city! For only 3.50 round trip or 7 for me and my fiancee in total, it is well worth the money spent. Once up top, lots of look out points available. The only reason I rated it 4 rather than 5 stars is because if you dont know the transportation system, this could end up being a farrrrrrrrrrrrrr walk to get to! As with any other city, wear your walking shoes!"
1,"A luxurious but relaxed bar atmosphere; excellent bar food; stellar service.  I don't know what more I could ask for in a place like this! \n\nThere is the bar/lounge section of the restaurant and also a dining section (separate from the bar and gaming, it's on the smaller side with some large, comfortable booths and tables).  Both are well-ventilated and surprisingly don't wreak of smoke, unlike some of the other gaming bar/restaurants in town.  \n\nService was top notch.  Our server was so friendly.  You could tell that she needed to be in both the bar and dining room but she did a fantastic job of keeping drinks full and being there to check in on us at all the right times.  \n\nThe food came out SO quickly and was just the ultimate of bar food!  Even the most basic things like the mozzarella bites as an appetizer were simply delicious!  Hubby had meatloaf sliders and I had burger sliders and they were both incredible.  Being able to sub fries for tots was a very nice change. \n\nThe menu is large and there are so many things I want to try.  And I'd love to sit on the patio when it cools down slightly.  My only problem: this place isn't closer to home.  If it were, I'd totally be a regular.  Give this place a try - it's even worth driving a bit if you don't live in the area!"
1,"UNFUCKIN'BELIEVABLE!!!\n\nI NEVER get emotional at concerts, but just seeing Garth walk on stage gave me chills and brought tears to my eyes!!  Garth's voice is phenomenal, amazing, mesmerizing ... you get the idea!!\n\nHe sang all my favorite songs and ended with the Ultimate Garth anthem: Friends in Low Places!!  He brought his wife Trisha Yearwood on stage and they sang their Duet In another's eyes beautifully . . . there is such amazing chemistry between the two (Duh, they're married).  Trisha then sang one of Garth's favorite songs of hers.  \n\nI could've used a little less talking/explanation and more of Garth's singing, but whatever, it was hands down one of the most amazing shows I have ever experienced.  I didn't know what to expect with just him and his guitar, but man that's all he really needs (a band is just an added bonus to his talented and captivating voice).\n\nThis is definitely one show I'd love to come back and see over and over and over and over again!!"
0,"The inebriated owner commanded us, mere pawns in his game of drunk restaurant chess, to a table in the back with his index finger, very much resembling in manner an old nonchalant cavalry brigadier. That same finger told us, dummies, to wait for minutes next to the table while it got cleaned. But it was a different finger that kicked us out of the restaurant for asking the owner - who happened to also be our waiter - to repeat something he mentioned from his improvised lunch menu. This was the middle finger, which he flipped at us along with a healthy dose of swearing and insults in his determination to make sure that we would never again return to his glorious establishment for our terrible misconduct. But that particular finger came out only after our table was swept away from us in a fury of hate and madness as innocent bystanders watched in horror. We exited the restaurant in silence and humiliation for our contemptible actions. Never again would we stand up for our right to repeat what a waiter says - lesson learned! And never would we receive the honor of trying one of the Grotto's legendary food offerings. \n\nConfused? Then my review has served its purpose. My feeling of confusion lingered on that day, and only after my thought process finally cleared a bit did I start to comprehend the fact that this was undeniably the most repulsive restaurant experience of my life. Thanks to the Grotto, my standards for restaurant service have sank to the bottom of Mariana's Trench! In retrospect, since this episode, I am actually really enjoying visits to very average restaurants. My ultimate recommendation to fellow Yelpers: when your standards for restaurant service become impossible to satisfy and you see yourself handing out a bunch of 3 star reviews, do yourself a favor and pay the Italian Grotto a visit!"
0,"I hated this place.  So tacky.  So loud... and not club/cool loud, cheesy cover band loud.  Annoying guy walking around on stilts making balloon animals.  Super overpriced food.  PASS!"
1,This is one of the best thai restaurants in town if you love thai this is the spot to head to. Nothing like having some great German wines with spicy food!
0,I agreed with Gary K. (his description is right on the money). This place is mediocre at best. Much better selection at Hibachi grill or Lin's Garden.
1,"You gotta be hip to be SQUARE.\n\nWhat a cool idea to have their ice cream in a square instead of round.  This is so helpful in so many ways.....\n\na.  The taste - 5 Star - I personally like Mocha chocolate fudge and Coffee in waffle cone. I usually don't order ice cream but when I do, watch out!  There are so many flavors, I cannot tell you all, but the texture is rich and creamy, the taste is awesome, the quality is like Ben and Jerry compared to a generic brand. \n\nb.  Location - 4 star - Near to St. Thomas More on Wigwam and Pecos. usually no parking issues, but no shaded trees to park under.  Boo Hoo when it is over 100.  you come here to cool off and then you heat back up!\n\nc.  Ambiance - 4 star - The place is a long rectangle, which is great for long lines. However it is not inviting at all for sitting and eating inside. Just a bit \""cold\"" or lacking character.\n\nIf you love ice cream and want a treat this  is the place to go!\n\nIF you want an even more unique experience, and want a crepe with your ice cream, drive a few miles south to Crepe Shack and Waffle on Eastern and Horizon Ridge in the KMart Sears area.  This is a great place for Thrifty ice cream in a crepe with fruit.  Totally Yummy."
1,"Great build-your-own style burgers. 4 kinds of meat (including portobello mushrooms) 4 buns, tons of cheeses and yummy toppings. House made potato chips, steak fries and onion rings. \n\nI had a burger with pepper jack cheese, green chilies and house made chipotle sauce. It was great... The sky's the limit on choices. \n\nPrices are very reasonable. $8 gets you the custom burger...which Is pretty good size and your choice of potato. Of course yelp gets you the free soda. Although they specialize in custom blended lemonade."
1,downtown jewel! The Amsterdam pasta is a must!! The fries are my fav and they have awesome specials throughout the week!  Great date restaurant or nice spot for drinks with friends!
0,"Two stars for the food, 5 stars for the bartenders and free popcorn. Sent the dog biscuit dry chicken back, got dry flavorless ribs in its stead. Don't eat here. But great place to come for drinks!"
1,I had a pleasant experience.  They were quick to find me a stylist (as I had no appointment) and the stylist took her time with my hair. I could not expect more; especially with a $5 price tag!!!
1,Deana is an awesome hair stylist!! I have for years drove 3 hrs to have my hair done!! She is flexible with her hours and fit me in last min I a Friday afternoon!! Even as messed up and dry as my hair was she fixed it and made me look beautiful again!! I would recommend her to anyone!!!
1,"Lee Lee's Oriental Supermarket is something you really have to experience.  Anything and everything you have experienced in  Asian cooking or dining is sold at Lee Lee's.  From fresh(live) seafood in the tanks that line the back of the store, to dining and cooking utensils, to beer and wine.  It's almost as interesting to just browse the isle as it is exciting to go shopping here.  You must see this place to believe it and to comprehend the extensive variety of items for sale."
1,"After living in Las Vegas for 3 years I am always reluctant to go back and spend more time there, however when I am staying at the Bellagio I don't mind so much :)\n\nThere are a million reviews for this place so I shall keep it short and sweet.\n\nMy room was beautiful and the attention to detail was outstanding. It is a huge hotel yet room service requests were always fast and the staff were very polite. Lake (Las Vegas Blvd) facing rooms are the best as you can watch the fountains from your own armchair and the music can be tuned in through your television. Amazing mattress and dreamy pillows, I could have slept forever! Fantastic bathroom with deep tub and separate shower which (if your heart desired) could fit about 15 people. Breakfast in bed was a treat and the butter stamped with a 'B' impressed me more than it should have!\n\nThe casino, the pool and the grounds are well maintained and the location of the hotel on the strip is perfect. Just beware there is a lot of walking involved, it's a big place!\n\nRoom Tip: Pay a little extra and get a lake facing room for a front row seat to every fountain show!"
0,"Being from Tucson, I used yelp to try and locate what is supposedly the best mexican food in the Phoenix/Scottsdale area.  I had high hopes when I arrived at this restaurant.  It is charming, and looks authentic.  Much like the restaurants down in Tucson.  The chips and salsa came out quick, and the service was great.  Chips and salsa were very good.  However, I was disappointed that you only get one serving, and then you have to pay $3 for another....something that I have never seen before.\n\nBut sadly, this is was the only positive for the restaurant.  I had a #1 and the person I was eating with had flat enchiladas.  If this is the best Phoenix has to offer, I feel bad for anyone living here.  The food lacked flavor, the green chili sauce tasted like they opened a can and poured it on top.  Beans and rice were not good at all.\n\nThe sopapillas were good, but that is not hard to mess up.\n\nAlso way overpriced for what you get. \n\n\nDo yourself a favor, and find another restaurant.  Not worth your time."
1,"The time was 4:30am.  It was dark and a little chilly with the sun not yet up.  Perhaps that's why they call it Black Friday, but my money was on the delicate hint of malice in the air as I stood shoulder to shoulder with  veteran soccer moms with steel and fire glinting from their eyes, Scowling teenagers and college students bubbling with nervous energy and the occasional hen-pecked dad who got talked into dealing with shopping insanity as some sort of a special treat before trudging off to the salt  mines for the day.\n\nThere were at least five hundred infantry ahead of me and five hundred behind me and our numbers kept growing.  There were scattered bits of conversation but most of us were silent, contemplating the chaos we were about to charge into for the sake of our families, our friends, our lovers.  But mostly for the sake of savings.  We glanced ahead and behind, sizing up the competition, mentally calculating our strategies for navigating the battlefield.  We were at least a battalion strong.  Perhaps a regiment by the time the doors would open.  And it would be every man woman and child for themselves.\n\nOccasionally, someone would open a wallet or a purse, checking and rechecking their ammunition, occasionally running a finger along the edge of a bank card or bill to make sure they maintained their razor edge.  Slowly, we began to march forward and the slow but steady trudge was a stark contrast to the sense of frantic urgency that crackled in the morning air.  Not all of us could walk away victors, but all of us were determined to try.\n\nThen something happened.  Something I would have never expected.  As we approached the double glass doors, we were greeted by another army.  With their bright blue uniforms, they could have been UN peacekeepers.  They handed us each a large plastic bag and ushered us into the store with bleary eyed smiles.  The fear and tension started to lift.  I have been at Toys R Us on Christmas eve.  I have seen the very worst of Holiday spirits and I was ready to face them again all for the sake of an (CENSORED) that (CENSORED) just had to have.\n\nYes the store was crowded.  But there were so many helpful, indeed cheerful sales attendants on hand that most of us shoppers just melted into a gentle wave of requests which were quickly and cheerfully met before anyone could get bent out of shape or stressed out.  A sales clerk simply asked me to wait for a moment while she located a reserve ticket for the doorbuster item I had stood in line for.  One minute and fifteen seconds later she returned with a document which guaranteed me my desired item at the desired price to be delivered to me as I left the store.  Another clerk helped me locate the other items I needed and I was done with my shopping within ten minutes.  \n\nOf course it took another hour or so to work through the serpentine line at the checkout but all of us were so relieved at how painless and indeed bloodless the shopping experience had been. We were more than happy to stand in line waiting for the opportunity to plunk down our hard earned cash on the latest objects of technolust that had caught the eyes of our loved ones.  We left tired.  And we left poor.  But I dare say most of us left happy and for that Best Buy and the entire Best Buy army have my eternal gratitude.  Thanks for taking the ass out of Christm."
0,"Nathan's $7 Cheeseburger Has Really Got Nothing Much More On A $1 McDouble\n\nSITREP\n\nIt certainly has nothing On TWO $1 McDoubles.  And what would anyone rather pay for very similar fast food hamburger- metrics?  $7?  Or $2?\n\nAIRPORT \""COST\"" METRICS\n\n\""Since we're an airport location, everything has to be more expensive!  *BULLSHIT*.  Nothing justifies more cost.

And then he said (again) it would be out in \""5 mins\"".\n\n*Shrug* Sometimes you don't win.\n\nAnd sometimes therr are just times you feel like an explanation of logic & common measurements of time, would have more impact if shared with a brick wall.\n\nTHE LOWDOWN\n\n2-Stars at least for the burger, cause it didn't suck.

1,"Fast, friendly service with HUGE portions. I feel like I underpaid. Food was delicious and felt just like home back on Maui. Will be returning anytime I'm feeling homesick or just wanna eat some ono kine grindz!"
1,"Nice little place specializing in waffles.  They are very good, but sweet in general and with added toppings, sugar rush!  Would still go back when in the mood for waffles and something sweet."
1,"LOVE. I've been to the Wynn and Wicked Spoon buffets (albeit the Wicked Spoon for brunch not dinner) and the Bacchanal is the BEST hands down, but especially in the dessert area. We were seated at the large table overlooking the Roman Pools and the decor in the buffet is absolutely fresh and stunning. I've never been to a buffet that was able to do Chinese dim sum dishes properly, but the Bacchanal pulls it off. My only regret is that my stomach was not large enough to sample everything. I cannot wait to return. I pray to god that the quality stays the same."
0,"terrible selection of shoes and jeans, and the changing rooms smell like a red line el stop. if you absolutely must visit a department store, drive a few miles and hit up macy's instead."
1,Nice selection of books and an awsome local history section. Helpful staff know their way around the stacks.
1,I love you. End of story.
0,My family and friends comes here every so often (my friends family comes here all the time) but this past sunday March 2nd 2014 the waitress was so rude that i couldnt even enjoy my food. She even charged my friend extra 1.50 for one side dish and initially didnt want to give us more napkins. That waitress (not the owner) made our time there unenjoyable.
1,"Stake Out is, by far, my favorite bar in town! First off, know this is a neighborhood bar, so don't expect a DJ or a dance floor. I have been going there for years because of three things: atmosphere, quality, and price. \n\nThe atmosphere at Stake Out is fantastic. Everyone I have met there is willing to socialize with their groups, as well as the strangers around them. The bartender, Gia, will make anything you want and is always up for a challenge. There is a waitress there, Summer, who is not only hilarious, but has a very warm personality. She tries to get to know her clients and make everyone feel right at home. Jim, the owner, takes pride in Stake Out. He comes in every night and can always been seen helping out behind the bar or serving the patrons. Quality guy for sure. The old time pictures and Christmas lights also add charm and uniqueness to the venue that gives it a very homey feeling. \n\nMy friends and I have never eaten a bad meal. Everything we order comes out quickly and tasting great. I would definitely suggest getting a cheese stake, it's definitely what they are known for.\n\nFinally, Stake Out offers some of the best prices in town! It's not many places that you can get a cheese stake with fries for around $8, and a pitcher of beer for around $10. \n\nOverall, I've probably been to about 20 bars in this city, but none of them come close to Stake Out! I highly recommend giving it a shot!"
0,"The PHX zoo is a great place to take your kids to look at large, charismatic megafauna.  However, if you are like me, you go to the zoo to try and learn something about the natural history and ecology of the animals on display.  There is very little of this, the farthest that the signage goes is to tell you the continent and maybe, if you are lucky, the country where the animal lives. The zoo is also mammal heavy. Don't get me wrong, I love a good mammal display, but I also like to see a nice collection of amphibians and reptiles.  If that is what you like to see, the PHX zoo is not the place for you.  They do have a small collection of southwestern rattlesnake and some common pet amphibians, but that is it for the herps...  They also have a komodo dragon that is pretty large but overall, they lack the fish, amphibians, and reptiles.  Also, where is the insect collections? Maybe I missed it.\n\nThe animals do have very large enclosures, but some look under kept.  Also, there is one aviary that is very cool and has some very pretty bird species.  They have red eared sliders hanging out in the ponds on the grounds that are probably the reason sliders are in natural waterways now...  a shame...\n\nOverall, I was pretty disappointed in the PHX zoo, the admission was pricey, and the breadth of animals small."
1,"Food Network tourist trap is what I thought before I came here.  It may be that but it's also damn good!  We were in town for a Pirates game(we go to a few different stadiums each year) and wanted to try this place out.  Of course we had to go to the original. Being a good diner, I had scoped out the menu 1st online and kept seeing \""our #2 seller\"" but never seeing number one.  So like any dumbass tourist, we asked what the number one seller was and she said \""the beer\"".  I may as well have been wearing a fanny pack and a hawaaiin shirt at that point.  \n\nI ordered the pastrami sandwich and Yuengling.  The beer was cold and pastrami was hot!  In case you don't know about Pirmanti's, the sandwich is an entrie meal.  It comes with what ever sammich you pick and then cole slaw and fries are on the sammich itself.  It's huge.  Sounds like a novelty but it works.  The crazy thing about it is it's only like 6.88 for this ginormous meal.  \n\nThere are about 50 different combinations of this sandwich and if I lived close, i'd try them all."
0,"This place has turned into a horrible dive bar. I used to go here back in 2009-2010 and it was really good. I stopped going when it started smelling like raw sewage a couple years ago. I figured that I would give it another shot today. Smell is gone. \n\nThis place needs to be on Bar Rescue. The manager sits at the corner of the bar drinking, cussing, and rolling silverware while the bartender talks to him and his buddies completely ignoring everyone else. \n\nOrdered some chicken fingers. 30 minutes later, I ask where they are. The bartender put them in but the kitchen didn't cook them. You can have them in 7 minutes they tell me. No thanks and thanks for checking on them over the last 30 minutes. I get a VERY insincere \""sorry\"". No comp on anything. Manger doesn't say anything except to keep drinking and being a loud mouth. \n\nI will never go back to this dump. If you live in STV do yourself a favor and go to someplace like Native New Yorker or even Don Pedro's (which isn't great either but WAY better than the Gym). \n\nIf I could give zero stars I would."
0,Gave up membership today. Unsanitary bathrooms with overfilled garbage cans almost always. All the locations are substandard in their bathrooms. Some equipment is most of the time in some sort of service for long periods of time. Maybe lifetime fitness will raise the bar in that regards. Their Az locations are very clean. Ventilation systems are weak as well. Either get a home gym or find a better spot.
1,great cheap gas station!! I'm always putting in gas for my road trips downtown! :) they even have cones that separate lines so that cars don't get into crazy turning accidents after gassing up! \n\nIt's so useful for Costcos to have all these things in one place! I don't put gas anywhere else :)
0,"No POOL ACCESS at a 4-star where you PAY A RESORT FEE! unbelievable!\nBeautiful furnishings but the beach pool is shut down in 78 degree weather. Misery during a great long weekend holiday. ANd they have the nerve to charge a $27 RESORT FEE ON TOP OF YOUR HOTEL ROOM PRICE!!!!!!\nAlthough very far from the strip, reserved the place for Valentines weekend because it was 4 star hotel. Even encouraged 3 other friends to join up! Very unfortunate that the hotel management has decided to NOT OPEN THE POOL so it sits there in all its tempting beauty with cabanas and waterfalls all around.\n\nAlso, it's not as quiet in the room as you would expect. I can hear people in the two neighboring rooms talking."
0,"I eat there about once a year, and I always wonder why I end up there. Generally, because I am with some vegetarian friends, and the restaurant is vegeterian friendly. It's also cheap, and the serviceis prompt. So, not everything is bad. \n\nBut the food is sometimes decent, but usually mediocre, and some dishes are simply terrible (like the chickpea salad which I ordered by accident: take a can of chick pea, add a few quarters of tasteless tomato on it, a few bits of prepackaged salad, and some kind of humus-based (?) sauce, and here we go...)."
0,Ra. Is Blah\nAnd the peeps. Give me the creeps.\n Service? Makes me nervous. \nThe vibe. Just don't jibe.\n Just not my scene. I'm a picky queen. \nDon't like the snotties. Acting all haughty.\nSake bombers cheap and good. Only reason I would.\nGo to Ra.\nBlah Blah Blah.
0,The sangria here is awful. I think it was a tequila sunrise. The food is greasy and not in a good way. The only thing good was the goat cheese. But it is goat cheese. How can you mess that up?
1,"One of my favorite places to be. Except during Zumba of course! I started recently coming back here to work out and get back into shape. For the most part they have avoided me about the free months I was suppose to get with signing my friends up, but whatever thats a thing I hate about this place. I did though get a year for $144 so its not too bad. \n\nI've checked out most of the gyms around my area and out of all of them, this one just simply has me most to offer me, seeing as I like running on a track and not a treadmill."
0,"Thought i would give them a try as they have so many great reviews,, im not sure why? Unless i just had a bad experience with them. I orered 2 pizzas and some chicken, the girl who answered the phone was very fast and quite rude, didnt even reapet my order back to me, so i was concerned to start with, after 45 minutes still no food, i phoned them again to confirm my order, they still had no time for me, even if they were busy there is no excuse, was bluntly  told that all deliveries had left, then they hung up the phone. 1 hour and 23 minutes after my order the food arrived, the driver was friendly. But unforuntatly the pizza was cold, maybe thats why it didnt taste very nice, just a bad experience.."
0,"Um. It's okay, I guess. They have food at decent prices, but the isles are narrow, everything needs a good cleaning and repainting, and it just felt dark and depressing. Otherwise it's all right, but I don't plan on returning here."
0,"Luci's is like one of those annoying \""slash\"" bands; you know, rock/ska/gregorian chant/fusion kind of thing.  Even if there's something you like, there's all that other stuff to contend with.\nThis place is a slick bastard child Mini-Me of a Trader Joe's meets Fresh & Easy meets Starbuck's meets CircleK, etc,etc,etc.\nThink of an item you can buy at one of those stores, add 50-100% to the price, reduce the selection to usually only one (or very few) choice(s), and voila!    ~ Luci's.\nEverywhere I looked I saw something I liked, tempered with something that made me take a step back.  Usually it was price.  Second most often it was selection.\n...then I got to the case with meats and cheeses and found prepackaged (excessively packaged,btw, way to be NOT green) slices of proscuitto or something similar that were way out of date - 6 days past the printed USE BY (not sell by) date.  For a store this small, to have more than a half dozen of these packages out in prominent view is not okay.  At least pull a F&E and let the clearance hounds take them for a bargain when they're about to be past due, but don't just keep trying to sell them for full price.\nThey make some fresh lemonade and teas, then put them into individual 20 oz/32 oz plastic cups and leave them in the fridge case.  Fine during a lunch hour rush, but for me to have seen a full case of 'em at 9pm-ish meant they were about to throw it all away (either that or save it for the next day?).  This is not only wasteful of food and plastic packaging, but also drives their costs up.\nThis feels like an expensive imitation of the real deal, like an \""authentic\"" NY deli or St Louis BBQ being dropped into Kierland Commons by  PepsiCo/KFC/PizzaHut/TacoBell, or when a Vintage (glorified thrift) shop opens up in an artsyfartsy or ritzy area and starts charging Vintage prices for stuff they got at Goodwill's 50% off sale the week before.\nAlthough I'm sure that's not where Luci's in getting their food.  It might not be $6.99 for a $2.99 box of cereal if they were."
0,Four flights on US Airways in the last three days and not a single one left or arrived on time.
0,"There's something about this place that always makes me feel like I don't want to be there.  It's a little dark, a little not-so-clean-looking, and nothing really stands out as being great.  Seems to be continually crowded though, so someone must like it I guess.  But the crowd is just another reason I tend to avoid it."
1,"This place isn't cheap, but the fish is top-notch and worth the money.  The food is cooked to order.  Their fillets (I had the catfish) have good size and are absolutely delicious.  I will definitely return to try their other fish and seafood."
0,The Owner of this business is not an honorable person .\nHe kept our drapes and is not cooperating with us to get them back.\nHe has either sold or destroyed our $12k worth of drapes.\n\nThis has never happened to us and we want to warn\nThe public that this is a shady business .\nStay away from this place
1,"This is a friendly, tasty, fried fast food joint. Fried but not greasy!!  I'm here with a group and the outside/inside choice is perfect. Everyone, even veggie lovers are happy!! The pernil empa is crispy but not greasy, with a delicious meatball of juicy pork. Also loved the plantains, rice and black beans! And the sweet empas were good too.  Dinner for $11! A real find"
1,Awesome customer service. We visit this place every time we are in vegas. But on Dec 24th they only had dinner buffet and when we told the manager (Laddi) we were leaving cause we couldn't order our favorite dish (malai paneer) he had the kitchen make it for us!! We felt so special and taken care of!! U guys gotta try this place! U wont be disappointed!!!
0,"I've been seeing dr. lewis for a few years now.  for the occasional need to treat colds or infections, he just comes in, checks you out, prescribes a drug and finishes within 5 minutes.  what I thought at the time was how efficient and to the point he is ( I hate going to see doctors)....\n\nHOWEVER... when I went to hatfield and saw dr. lewis last year regarding my testosterone levels, it was business as usual and he sent me out to get bloodwork done (had to make a co-pay).  went and got blood drawn (cost me another $200 -more than 800 without insurance according to cigna)..\n\nwhen I went back to hatfield (another copay) on the bloodwork follow-up and results, dr. lewis came in and did his usual schpiel and said that the testosterone results were pending and I had to come back (for another co-pay) when the result came in (he requested them from the lab again).  he also gave me a bloodwork order (more money out of my pocket) just in case the results didn't come in.   he also proceeded to tell me about my high cholesterol and other results.  I tried to tell him about my medical history and he didn't acknowledge them because I am just a patient and he was the doctor.  how dare I question his so-called authority!  I left feeling very disgusted.\n\nI called the office a few days later to see if the testosterone results were in and they had to request again and give me a call when it arrived.   it is now 5 months and still waiting................................\n\noverall score for hatfield and dr. lewis:  1 star ( I couldn't give them zero stars...)"
0,"Are... You... Serious......\n\nWhy in the world is this place so popular? I really wish it wasn't so I wouldn't have been tempted to go and waste my time and money!\n\n1. Took them 15-20 minutes to bring us water. We just came from a pool party and we were SOOO dehydrated. It shouldn't really matter where we came from, everyone is dehydrated in Vegas, it's a desert! Hello! Can we please have some water ASAP?! \n\n2. Food took a million years to come out.\n\n3. Food was mediocre, at best. The $30 ribs were so dry they tasted like dirt. The pasta had no flavor. The omelette was okay. The burger was okay too. But we could've gone somewhere else and paid the same price for much better food. REGRETS!\n\n4. The frozen hot chocolate they brought me (the only thing I really wanted to come for) looked and tasted TERRIBLE! Well, I guess it tasted alright... Like icy hot chocolate basically. But RIGHT when they brought it out, it was melting all over! I couldn't even get a good picture in. I had to send it back. I have NEVER sent back anything in my life, but I was NOT about to pay $15 (is that how much it is?) for that.... No thank you... They brought the tables next to me prettier frozen hot chocolates. Why did MINE suck?! Whatever, saved $15 I guess.\n\nDon't waste your time, people! Go elsewhere. \n\nExtremely disappointed as I was really looking forward to trying this place!"
0,"Came here for lunch. Lady taking orders ignored us completely, talking to her friend about her kids. Had to actually interrupt them and ask to put in my order. Calamari was soggy and chewy.... disgusting. It took 40 minutes to get my pizza, had to go ask about its status and it was just sitting there ready to go but no one had delivered it to our table. Good pizza, nasty calamari, horrific service. Don't go during lunch time."
1,"If you are a food and cooking nut like me, do not go in here unless you have about 45 minutes to browse. I could spend 15 minutes just standing in front of the knife case dreaming of having one of everything.   This store has every little cooking gadget, gizmo and doodad you could imagine.  They have egg toppers, egg cups, 4 kinds of citrus reamers, 20 kinds of spice grinders and 4 shelves of just teapots.  They have tons of specialty ingredients like fancy salts, mustards and jams.  As the other review mentioned some of the stuff is overpriced but a lot of the time you can get some great things for cheap.  Their clearance section always has some deals if you can sift through the mess without breaking anything.  The only thing I don't like about this location is I have to walk past the obnoxious patrons on the patio at Pink Taco to get to the store.  Although, it was funny to hear an older lady ask her son if he has tried the Pink Taco yet.  Ah, Scottsdale."
1,Great dinner.   They had never heard of a white pizza so had pasta instead.  So delicious!    Kids loved their food too.   Desserts not super.  Can't be the same chef making those.
1,"This place got a lot of good reviews.  My last day in town and I needed a mani pedi before heading home.  It was a Friday afternoon about 4pm.  I arrived just ahead of the rush.  The girl that I had must have been newer.  She was sweet and took her time to get it right but I didn't mind the slowness.  She did a good job. Nothing fancy, just a mani buff and pink toes.  As I watched people come in, the other workers were gruff and seemed annoyed but perhaps it was because they knew what they were in for, as the group of customers immediately started complaining about prices and taking over the place. \n\nHaggling wasn't necessary, as the prices are better than reasonable and were posted.  The owner or manager greeted me with a big smile and swapped out my hot water bottle from the car, with a fresh icy one from the back, which showed great customer service.  \n\nFrom the reviews and my experience on this visit; they treat you as a good customer straight-away and will give you good service if you don't try to take advantage of them.  Asking price is one thing, complaining about an extra charge for extra service requested is another. \n\nService is great.  Only note of improvement would be for the guys not to hangout, out front, smoking and talking on their cell phones.  It gives the place a sketchy feel and they might get better customers if someone isn't haunting around outside.  No woman willing to pay a good price, wants some older man, wreaking of cigarettes to be working on their nails. That is what I expected to be confronted with when walking in but was prepared to speak up if so.  I know the women in my family would just avoid the place and find somewhere else to go."
0,"My experience wasn't very good.  I'd rather wear wooden teeth than go back.  I'm still walking around with a crown out of adjustment.  The staff was fine and professional but the dentist... I thought was very expensive for the quality of work.  Get a second opinion, shop around is my advice."
1,"I really like Old Chicago (OC) for a few different reasons. \n\nIf you're a fan of beer like me, they've got a decent line up and rotation of beers (draft and bottle) from all over the world. Also they have this program called world beer tour where you get some free goodies if you drink a certain amount (can we say promoting alcoholism? I'm down). This kinda reminds me of the old program they had going at rock bottom where they would put your name on the placard if you drank like over 100 beers (and you get like tshirts, free food, etc along the way)\n\nSecondly, the pizza is darn delicious there. I know it's a chain, but still great tasting pizzas with variety of toppings. I haven't got a chance to try anything other than the pizzas there, but hey isn't this supposed to be a pizza place? Mama mia. \n\nLastly, it's super close to my school and I have gotten take out a few times so another star for convenience."
1,"So me and 3 other girls went here thinking that it was gonna suck because of the reviews... But it didn't.\n\nIt was reallllllllly crowded and there is literally nowhere to sit if you don't have table reservations. But who needs to sit??\n\nI drank jack and coke at $12 a drink. \n\nThe music was really fun and the crowd was pretty hot.\n\nThere is an indoor and an outdoor space that are both really nice. And there are 3 separate bars that are definitely needed due to the crowds. \n\nNext time I'm in Vegas I will absolutely be returning to this place. And I would make the 5 minute call to get on the guest list (for this club or any other for that matter, its not worth being a lazy ass). Or if you're gonna want a place to sit, make VIP table reservations."
0,"worst food I can remember in my 67 years... prime rib was pure gristle, wrong wine was served and manager Carl Adams refused to adjust bill from the $11 split which we ordered  to the $45 dollar half bottle that he delivered... first time ever charged for the chiefs birthday cake, which went back uneaten as it was awful .  STAY FAR FAR FAR AWAY.  there is a reason why the restaurant is nearly empty...  food, management and service is below one star... so Remington's is getting more of a rating than deserved..."

0,"Staff ok, nothing special. Burgers ok, for the price and taste.  In and out beats five guys for price, taste and customer service. CAUTION- if you get fries and burger to go.. Grease went thru the paper bag and onto my car seat"
0,"I don't know if i would come back here. So here is the review. \n\nMy boyfriend and I went to Osaka to try out their late night menu. \n\n$11 for 6 piece sashimi, $7 for some of their half rolls, $22 for fresh scallop (not part of late night menu). Wanted to get the fresh Uni, but they sold out. Got the wings, Gyu Maki and shrimp shumai as appetizers.\n\nEverything just seemed off. First of all the quality of the fish was not great. Really thin pieces, and almost dry. Got a white tiger roll, it was okay, like the Bonzai sauce, but everything else was just really plain. Fried wings were bland and just looked sad accompanied with raw broccoli and dry carrots.\n\nNo music was playing so it got really awkward cuz the sushi chefs were just busy making orders and they didn't even make eye contact with us. If it wasn't for the TV behind the bar we don't know if we would be able sit through our meal.\n\nIn the end, we just ate really quick and left. Like I said before, don't know if I would revisit again, maybe if they spruce up the atmosphere a little bit and get better quality of food."
1,MMmm gelato for breakfast lunch and dinner anyone?? Just knowing that it was right around the corner ever sooo conveniently next to the elevators was awesome!! The rooms were nice and the restroom was spacious enough. Elevators open right when you press the button so no need to wait 5-10 minutes. \n\nCafe Bellagio was always opened and pretty quick with bringing out the food. Pools were clean and spacious. The type of people that stayed there weren't obnoxious either. Great place to stay.
1,"great place, staff and food, plus 50% off every monday on pizzas and toppings."
0,"Worst leasing office! First of all they wrote the wrong rent amount on our lease. When my roommate and I went together to sign the lease there was a temp working. We initialed and signed. Then the office calls us back to say they gave us the wrong lease and to come back to sign new with correct amount which was $40 higher. Are you kidding me? We refused to sign new lease and this is there mistake. Called corporate office and they assured us that we are right about not having to sign a new lease. \n\nAmong other small issues about the apartment, They had an insect sprayer guy come to spray all apartments. A couple weeks later they called to confirm our \""bed bug treatment\"".. WTF! We said no one ever informed us the inspector found bed bugs! They said someone was suppose to call us. I was in Cali at this time freaking out! They were treating tomorrow. My roommate and I were furious no one notified us of this! They gave us a list of how to prepare for treatment. I came home that night late and trash bagged EVERTHING I own! We had to clean out kitchen cabinets and moved all furniture to center of rooms. I told them I know we don't have bed bugs since I have never been bitten! Next morning insect spray guy comes to our apartment that I had to take time off work to be there. I went to leasing office to ask if someone can help move my bed and they look at me confused stating \""he's only going to spray, not treat\"" I looked at inspector and he said he never said we had bed bugs! No no bed bugs... WTF 10xs.. The leasing office just look at me like Oh Well. I got no apology. I called corporate again. Nothing they can do. I had to get all my clothes out of trash bags and put everything back! \n\nLastly I was told I'd get my pet deposit and gate remote refunded at moving out. I only received one check in full for the remotes. I called and spoke to manger and she said she will mail the pet refund and also said our last water bill was taken out of this check. Fine. I never got a check! For months I called and manager tells me I was never due a refund for pet. Seriously! I called corporate again. Of course they don't deal with money issues.. \n\nThis place is has made me feel absolutely taken advantage of. It was incredibly stressful to feel like you have bed bugs and no one told you. Thankfully we didn't but thanks Ingleside for the suffering and not apologizing."
0,"Very meh.  Absolutely mediocre.  Fatty beef, dry chicken, bad bleu cheese.  I will not be back.  This was for the lunch buffet."
1,"I've been having Claim Jumper withdrawal since the ones by my home have closed down and the only one close by is 45 miles away in Irvine, CA.  I saw on yelp there was one in Vegas so we decided to come here since we are fans of CJ.\n\nI ordered the country fried steak . The portions were huge and on top of that, I got two. I only finished one. I did eat the mashed potatoes which were very good. I had to take the rest back to the hotel.\n\nOur waitress, Holly was very nice and gracious.  Excellent server. I will be back again on my next trip to Vegas to get my CJ fix again."
1,My son (he's 4) and I LOVE Mojos!  Great tasting yogurt thats not too sweet and is perfectly refreshing.  He loves picking out toppings - I've had to limit him to 5 toppings because he wants to put everything in his bowl!  We often stop by when they have their Facebook special words and you get half off - love that.  The only thing I don't like is that sometimes its a little hard to work the machines to put the yogurt in the cup.
1,"I've been here before when traveling for business and enjoyed the food and cocktails, but I had an even better experience today. Michelle, the bartender, gave me a great recommendation for dinner--chicken and dumplings. They're not the traditional southern way but with gnocchi. It was so good, and amazingly light. Plus, Michelle has a lovely bubbly personality---I can see why several regulars came in just to see her."
1,"Vegas just wouldn't be the same for me without multiple visits to Secret Pizza! It's been a good two years since my last trip to Sin City and I'm proud to say that it's still the real deal! I took a girlfriend here with me on our first night and at 3am it was still open and still in the same spot on the 4th floor of the Cosmo. She marveled at how there's no signage, no listing, and I replied \""That's why it's a SECRET! Lol\"" Even at 3am there's a long line but thankfully everything moves pretty quickly. True to Vegas party scene everyone in line with us was pretty much wasted and the folks behind us were obnoxiously drunk. \n\nWe finally got to the front and the pizza guy chit chatted with us about what slices they were offering at that time. I honestly marvel at how nice everyone is at Secret Pizza because if I had to deal with all the tomfoolery I don't think I'd be nearly as patient. We each got two slices and a Coke to go. The prices have gone up from $3.50 to $4.75 per slice with an additional $.50 per topping. Still not so bad when you consider that you're in a very touristy area and it is 3am. \n\nOverall still a really great experience and literally a \""hidden\"" gem on the Las Vegas Strip. We came back the next night again for Secret Pizza as we were hanging out at the bar and my girlfriend came back a third time the next night because she wanted to make sure she got another slice before we headed back home! Now THAT is some gooooood pizza folks! May you be very lucky during your trip to Vegas and may your stomach be blessed with the deliciousness of Secret Pizza!!!"
1,"I miss Postino's.  Once upon a time, I worked less than a block from here, and frequently stopped by for lunch or after work for some wine and bruschetta.  To this day, I have never had anything like their bruschetta.  Don't order it as an appetizer; it's definitely a meal.  Large and luscious, sweet and savory, served on a slightly rustic wooden plank, topped with amazing things like apples, soft cheeses, figs, and pistachios.  It's the stuff dreams are made of.  I wish they would hurry up and open the one in Gilbert.  I'm never in Arcadia at the right time anymore.  Also, do not expect to find parking here; you will definitely have to valet.  That's not just a Postino's thing, though, that's an Arcadia thing."
1,"My mom and I ate breakfast at this cute restaurant two days in a row. Both my egg and cheese sandwich and omelette were straightforward, fresh and tasty. \n\nThe contents of the omelette were wrapped in egg that was about the thickness of a crepe. My omelette had bacon in it. I asked for the bacon to be burned and unlike some other places which  are unwilling to comply, they burned it! Because of the heat, I was glad to see they weren't trying to go for a gigantic thick and heavy omelette. The egg and cheese on an English muffin was just that. They didnt try to sneak in any butter or anything on the bread. I had an iced hazelnut mocha which was refreshing and also huge! I had to take most of it to go."
1,"My husband and I snatched up a Yelp deal and headed in for dinner. \n\nWe walked in at a weird moment where people were leaving with and other waiting on take-out orders while yet others were getting seated. We weren't yet aware that dine-in folks were seated so we stood for a bit until we caught on. \n\nThe room smelled great. The walls were decorated with photos, articles, and art pieces that made the space comfortable and reflected the family ownership. The rest of the space is straightforward with seats, which I appreciate in a BBQ place. I don't know why, but overly decorated BBQ places are weird to me. Sidenote: the UCLA sticker in the window was not lost on us recent transplants from Los Angeles and Bruin alumni. \n\nAnyway, our server welcomed us and got our drinks. I don't know what it is with this city but, as usual, the refillable fountain drinks were Pepsi. However, it was nice to know that Coke products were available in cans (just not refillable). Being a human camel, I went with the refillable stuff. \n\nWhen we ordered, our server asked if we'd been in before and we said no. She very genuinely and excitedly welcome us and expressed her happiness about our first visit. That didn't go unnoticed. It was really sweet. \n\nIt being Friday and me loving fish, I already knew I was ordering the daily special of fried catfish. I went with the 3 piece meal with two sides - fried okra and mac and cheese - with cornbread. \n\nLet me just say that the catfish was so on point that my husband and I ate the entire portion despite my promises to myself to save half for later. The fish was perfectly fried and seasoned; crisp and clean and in no way greasy or fishy. As I mentioned, we recently moved from LA. Our old apartment out there was close to many soul food options and this catfish was on par with many of our favorites. My heart was happy from this dish. \n\nThe fried okra was also well cooked. I think it missed a sauce but the hot sauce at the table worked well. \n\nThe mac and cheese was cheesy and thick though a tab bit on the colder side. Still, despite the temperature, it was a solid accompaniment to the entire shared meal. \n\nhttp://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=rVzUDPH_6vUEQOFuNBIovQ&userid=5DFshFQlbQiQTvtzH7qwlA\n\nMy husband, and rib lover and pork enthusiast, went with the three-meat plate and upgraded to all the ribs available: 1/4 slab pork spare ribs, 1/4 rack pork baby back ribs, and 1/4 rack beef ribs. He selected greens and fries for his sides. \n\nhttp://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=ZNYVsrPOUg0n91NhzKZv5w&userid=5DFshFQlbQiQTvtzH7qwlA\n\nhttp://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=znzhMgybO7TFHvg0VV4agQ&userid=5DFshFQlbQiQTvtzH7qwlA\n\nWe're both from pork loving cultures and the ribs did not disappoint. They all had a lovely smokiness and tenderness. I usually favor pork ribs but, in this instance, I felt the beef ribs were the most outstanding. My husband  favored the baby back ribs. \n\nBeing greedy, we tacked on an order of brisket . Also, Friday nights are usually cheat and date nights. Just saying. Don't judge. I'm capable of eating even more. \n\nhttp://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=gms7IFEgYRSA-HioCsyGmg&userid=5DFshFQlbQiQTvtzH7qwlA\n\nI was surprised at the thin slices of the brisket but I rather enjoyed it. It reminds me of Korean BBQ brisket, but with soul. It was fantastic stuffed into the accompanying cornbread. \n\nI felt the service was very attentive. We were checked in on just enough to feel catered to without feeling suffocated and I had no trouble getting refills. We had a few hiccups on the food (had to ask for the cornbread and brisket after everything else came out)  but that didn't really bother us. Actually, it made us laugh about how overzealous our order was. However, I will say I was disappointed we weren't offered dessert. I forgot what was on the menu but I probably would have gladly ordered something. \n\nThe tab came out to $48 for 2 drinks, 3-meat all rib plate, catfish, 4 sides, and brisket a la carte. With the Yelp deal, that dropped down to $27. Tip and the original $10 to buy the deal brought the total back to $47, which I think was absolutely fair even without the deal. \n\nThat all being said, I think 3.5-3.75 stars is on point and we look forward to returning soon. If I recall correctly, my husband plans on a full rack next time (I assume baby backs). If, for some reason I find myself off from work on a weekday, I will beeline here to check out the $4.99 lunch deals!"
1,"I use this Wells Fargo for business banking and I have always had great customer service here. Sometimes the lines can get long but that is the case with any bank. The thing that sets this location apart from others is the customer service reps who come and ask if they can get you water or coffee while you wait. The tellers are all extremely friendly and it really makes me think that whoever manages this branch is doing a really good job. Overall I really enjoy my experience at this location of Wells Fargo and if it was not so much of a hassle with my other bank, I might consider switching my personal accounts over to this location as well."
0,"This is the second time I have been to this location and the experiences were very different. \n\nFirst of all the service was awful.   I should have walked out and regret not doing it.   My wife and I started with the simple dinner salad.   It was a very large portion but 99% lettuce.   I will say the home made croutons were awesome but nothing else.   We waited over 5 minutes for dressing that we asked 2 different servers for. \n\nI ordered the chicken lasagna.   No nice way to say it,  it SUCKED.  Very bland and burnt.   Maybe some of the food here is good but this isn't.   My wife ordered a margarita pizza.   Not good either but wouldn't go so far as to say it sucked.\n\nI was very disappointed with this restaurant and will not be back,  ever.   I would say do not waste your money here.  Some reviews seem good so maybe we caught them on the wrong day? ? Or ordered the worst stuff on the menu?   Either way with so many good restaurant's over here I would skip this place."
0,"I hate the place, but my Wife loves it.\nWe BOTH love FLO'S, about 1 mile to the North.\nFor some reason, entree's are poorer, with carryout.\nAvoid ordering any of the Soups ...... their pretty poor."
1,"Make sure a tour will be available when you go, otherwise you won't be able to enter the nationality rooms (especially on the weekend).  This is an amazing space.  I can't imagine being able to stroll here to do my studying!  I was totally enchanted."
0,Food and staff Not as good as it used to be. Sad because its  beautiful atmosphere and furnishings
1,"I really like this place. I have been going there for blended iced coffee and they are great. I also really like the soups they have. There are always a few choices and I have never been disappointed. They are the only place I can find that sells chocolate covered coffee beans which are delicious. The only other food item I've tried there is a breakfast burrito. The burrito was very good, but they take a little while to make so if you are planning on ordering a sandwich or something like that make sure you have time because everything is handmade to order."
1,"I used to be a Palazzo Hotel guest regular until I discovered M Resort Hotel...c'mon free comp room..now how could anyone pass that up right?  =)  The Studio B buffet  is a great staple but really wanted to try Jayde Fuzion.  I watched a few episode of Food Network \""Restaurant's Express and so that's how i knew of the Executive Chef for this restaurant. Of course it was a plus she was Korean...gotta support my peoples :)\n\nWe arrived right when they opened (5pm) so there was no wait! As i skimmed through the menu, i saw alot of authetic korean dishes in which was awesome. I was quite interested in seeing how they would execute the taste since I grew up with Korean food. The portions were smaller than i'm used to but the flavor of everything was superb! This is what we ordered:\n\nKorean Lobster-This dish reminded me of many chinese type dishes i've had in the past with the usual ginger and soy sauce base flavor but i love how they added a twist by making it korean, as it's name, by adding some korean pork, spices and veggies. There wasn't that much lobster pieces but in other restaurant dishes....they really isn't in the first place. I would definately eat this again...but maybe next time i'll order two for just myself..oink oink!\nPork Wrap-This was a fancy upgrade to what i'm used to, Samgyupsal (korean name for it). It tasted the similar but again with special additional ingredients.  Nice appetizer instead of just a salad. They give you four pieces. \nKalbi Rib-This was sweeter than the normal kalbi i'm used to. The beef quality was great but i wasn't really digging the extra sweetness. You can definately taste the kalbi that you usually eat but with a thicker teriyaki like sauce. I would've like them to have brought this out with white rice or something to neutralize the sweetness.\nKimchee Fried Rice-This was my absolute favorite of the dishes! OMG it's just like mom makes it but this extra spice/seasoning that kicks you to want more in your mouth. CRACK would be a better word. More please?!?!?!?!?\n\nSince it seems like they have mostly korean dishes, i wish the name and decor was more \""korean\"" themed though.They have the green for chinese and the cherry blossoms for japanese......Oh well maybe later if they ever remodel. =)"
0,"My wife's seafood pasta special of the night was good, but my bolognaise was straight out of a can, and not worth eating.  The service was very good, ambiance was decent, but I wouldn't go back."
1,"Affordable and fast!  $1.75 for laundered shirts, $4.50 for dress dry cleaning, $8 original hems."
1,"Good prices. \nGood NY pizza. \nFast. \nGood selection of slices with cool toppings. \nEasy to stop in if you're walking on Fremont. \n\nBottom line: don't drive across town for this one, but it's a good stop if you're on foot in the area."
0,"I have been to many a asian mart in my day but this place is really the epitome of the stereotype of an asian mart. \n\nThere are no windows in the bulk of the store and the windows in the front are all covered up......I have no idea why..........\n\n.......still wondering why.........\n\nMoving on, I can see the appeal of this store as they do carry 13208923874820983534 brands of oriental specialty items like all of the candies, snacks, dried food, teas, etc. This place is packed from ceiling to the ground and the aisles were just afterthoughts! \n\nThe produce section was borderline scary and I would never buy produce from there. With the amount of people that were in there when I was there I would think that they would have enough money to expand....or at least brighten the place up a bit!!! There wasn't too many things in the produce section that I wouldn't be able to find in another grocery store, although I'm pretty sure they would never be as cheap at another place!\n\nDisappointed that they didn't carry any oriental dishes/cups/teapots/platters/etc.\n\nI wouldn't come back unless I was in DIRE need of something that I couldn't find anywhere else...the way that the store is kept is really a reflection of the owners interest in it....and this place is seriously depressing."
0,"The evening started out with the wrong vibe.  Our reservation was at 7:00 and we were 5 minutes early. There were plenty of empty tables, however, we were shown to a table next to the kitchen with the Reserved sign.  \nCocktails were prepared well and prompt. \nOur waiter told us about the evening specials, they happened to be the two most expensive items on the menu. \nWe ordered two starters. Scallops and fried green tomatoes.  The scallops were cooked well. They were moist and flavorful. The fried green tomatoes were  over cooked.  I also ordered a crab bisque soup. The soup was warm with a lump of very cold crab at the bottom of the cup.  \nI ordered the Grouper (an evening special) over risotto. The fish was mushy and the risotto was gummy.  My wife ordered the New York Strip (the other evening special). It arrived covered with corn and an glob of mashed sweet potato over half of the meat. The steak was tough. An uneven cut, thin on one side. So it was over cooked on one end.  Our two guests were equally dissatisfied.  I think a special should really be special and not just a expensive menu item. \nOur waiter never once ask how our meal was.  We paid the bill and tipped well. We most likely won't return.  There are too many good choices in Charlotte.\nMaybe it was an off night."
0,"Had the worst experience eating at this restaurant. Cashier in front gave us the worst attitude.  I used to come to this restaurant every time I come to Las Vegas, I will not go any more."
1,"I'm stupid when it comes cupid.  I love this place.   I bought some candles, soaps and a cool magnet for my refrigerator.  Excellent Service!  I'LL BE BACK!"
0,"\""Very rude waitress. Under staffed. One blue moon was $9.50 after tax. I waited 18 minutes before I was served. They make you pay and tip immediately. The waitress rolled her eyes at me and said, \""Really?\"" when I tipped her 10%...when she deserved no tip. AVOID!!!\"""
1,Great place for seniors to go during the week before 6pm. They have a great promotion going in right now.  The salad bar was clean and the veggies were fresh. The folks there kept our table clean. How can you go wrong for $15 for two. BTW my favorite soup was the mushroom.
1,"To be perfectly (and embarrassingly) honest, I started going to Industry specifically because I knew I would not see anyone that I knew there. Sometimes you just really don't want a place where anybody knows your name. Sometimes you want to be a girl, alone at a bar, drinking a bourbon and reading a book. And Industry fits the bill perfectly. It's a good-looking place with a giant bar area and plenty of table seating -- but who cares about that when you want to eat alone? It's not too dark, there are lots of TVs, the music is a mystifying mix of Vampire Weekend, Beyonce and 80s, the servers range from charmingly social to semi-efficiently disinterested (which I'm ok with), the food is decent -- I like the salads and the flatbreads but have heard mixed things about everything else -- and the drinks are interesting. Basically, it's the perfect combination of safe and anonymous, with the added benefit of a competent kitchen. \n\nThe cocktails tend to be on the sweet side and for some reason the person who designed the menu decided to name both a drink and a salad the Menlo Park, which makes for some confusion and seems like a ridiculous oversight. \n\nPricing is reasonable: many menu items are under $10.00. The cocktails are also reasonable but, given the sweetness, not really worth it. Or maybe they are. It depends what you like.\n\nBasically, this is a place I go by myself. Maybe I'd go with friends. And I'd definitely go with a blind date."
1,"Our first time for supper.  The service was excellent, atmosphere casual elegant and beautiful views of the city and mountains.  My husband had a delicious Beef Stroganoff with fresh homemade noodles and light creamy sauce.  I had Sea Scallops on a bed of fresh risotto with lemon aioli.  We'll be back!"
0,"Wow, I'm going to have to show this to my friend who thought I was \""being too picky\"" when in essence, he obviously  has some simple ass taste buds.\n\nIt started out wonderfully. The sun was about 1/2 hour from setting and casting that orange glow that Phoenix does so well. We went there for the ambiance. I offered to treat. Little did I know, I was in for a treat and it sure as hell wasn't a good one.\n\nSo we get Kathy (I think that was this crappy waitress' name).  She takes my friend's drink order and I'm still deciding and she just walks away. No \""I'll be back\"" or anything customer service-y like that. Then she comes back and takes my drink order. Fine.\n\nShe suggests the Pork chops and even though I eat 90% vegetarian, I go with her suggestion. Cause the alternative is one boring salad choice.  It comes back pink and rubbery. What the--?I don't give a crap what anyone says, pork ain't supposed to be pink. That  means it ain't cooked and I ain't eating it. So I send it back and it comes back clearly microwaved for a few seconds and guess what? Still freakin' pink on the inside.\n\nLovely! So this girl asks if I want to try the  Chilean Sea Bass. Ok, now I've had too much alcohol and I'm not thinking properly cause that shit's endangered - - very politically incorrect but I'm near my boiling point  so I  agree and think surely something's getting spit in or on.\n\nWell, she brings out beers stating that \""he bought you  2 beers for the trouble\"". Huh? He who? The waiter? The manager? And she damn near slams them on the table. Now I'm about to ghetto but my friend just casts me a look that puts me in check.\n\nSo the sea bass finally comes and you are seriously not going to believe this-----it was pink and pretty much undercooked. And of course, I had her take it back and then it came back flaky. I ate a few forkfuls but was pretty much frickin done at that point and now burdened with a 3-beer buzz within 1.5 hours. Not good.\n\nThat's why they put the restaurant on top of those damn rocks so you'll be distracted away from the crappy service, mediocre food, ignorant help, and gouging prices. There is no way that food is worth what they charge. And I agree 100% with the other reviewer that I could have made that shit at home. Cooked thoroughly and a helluva lot tastier and I didnt go to culinary school.\n\nThere's so much more to bitch about people but I'll stop right here or you'll be scrolling down forever. I apologize for all the cussing. I don't normally in my reviews cause I think it's tacky. But this review could not have been true to itself without these appropriate words.\n\nI can't believe I tipped that jerk. What the heck was I thinking. One star and that's only for the view. \n\nDON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THE FOOD! DRINKS MAYBE SO YOU CAN GET THE VIEW BUT THATS IT!"
0,"Three of us stayed here for an event that was happening in Mesa. We appreciated the discounted rate for the weekend but it definitely was not the greatest hotel. The staff at the desk was friendly and check in was very fast. We booked a 2 queenbed room. When we walked in it was really hot and muggy. Smelled funky... But it was pretty clean and definitely a good size. You could easily fit 6 people in one room. I turned the air on cool right away and there was nothing coming out of the vent. We decided to get dinnerand give it some time to cool. We get back 2 hours later and it is even hotter. I called the front desk and the man answered, 'yes?' I said hello again wondering if he was talking to someone else? Answer again was 'yes?' not a 'hi how can I help you?' which would seem more customer friendly and professional but whatever. We asked if we could have the air looked at because it was very hot. He said he would send the maintenance man over. He climbed on a ladder and looked in the ceiling then mumbles about some hot water bottle being on said to give it a minute and left... We thought..ok it will cool down. Opened the windows and went to bed. I woke up drenched in sweat and hearing this loud noise. We discovered it was a cricket insie the room and luckily found it and killed the loud guy. We couldnt sleep from the heat and the noise and put up with it until morning.\n\n Breakfast was free, which is nice since a lot of hotels don't offer that anymore but unfortunately the eggs were instant eggs... for free breakfast it was ok. After breakfast I decided to go to the front desk and ask about the heat in the room. The woman at the front was very nice and explained that in the winter time when the weather is nice in Phoenix the turn the cool air completely off and apologized. It would have been nice to have air conditioning for the room since it was so muggy feeling and even though the weather was cool outside, there was no breeze to bring in that cool weather. I know they must be trying to save a buck but... it would probably make people more comfortable despite the cool weather during the winter.\n\nThe next night we turned the air off which helped since it was blowing hot nasty air and were too tired to even care about the temperature. Checkout was easy."
1,"Still giving this place 4 stars because their sushi is downright amazing, but being a long-standing customer here, I'm still confused about how their all-you-can-eat sushi works.  We stopped by last night, and as an appetizer, we got a small salad and edamame, but no sashimi plate that I had mentioned in my last review.  And we weren't offered ice cream at the end of the meal either.  Also, although it was advertised as $19.99, it's really $21.99.  Not a big deal, but I did scowl slightly at my receipt.  Unlike other days, they were very prompt about getting our second round of sushi, and this, I fully appreciate.  I guess in summary, don't expect anything other than what you order, but if on the off chance you do get a sashimi plate for an appetizer and ice cream for dessert, you're in for a treat."
0,"Last time I was here it was New Years Eve. Place was a mad house, and the lady wouldn't sell me two 24oz beers. I mean, dude, whats the prob - it was new years eve, you think you're gonna get popped for selling a guy booze? There were about 500,000 other people in there."
0,"Just gross.\nGo to experience some epic people watching, maybe stick around for the light show, and then go immediately back to the strip. Talk about a hot mess. Second-rate go-go dancers, dirty smokey casinos, and cracked out bums are abundant. People trying to sell you crap at every turn. No decent places to eat or shop. The only plus might be if you are a gambler, you might find a better deal than on the strip.\n\nI can't believe people brought their kids here, seriously. I checked seeing old Vegas off of my list, and now I don't ever have to go back...THANK GOD."
1,Never had a disappointing meal here. Very good!
0,"This place is terrible.  The first time I went they couldn't do what I wanted.  Said it was company policy - ok, fine, not a big deal.  I wouldn't hold that against them but the employee I talked to wasn't particularly friendly.\n\nI went in yesterday to get a battery replaced.  I walked in at the same time as a family that had apparently already been in for service and came back to complain about something not working.  We waited a good 5 minutes before anyone came in to help us.  \n\nAfter they were finally dealt with he came back to see what I needed.  Told me it would be at least 15 before he could help me but checked to see if they had my battery.  He went back outside to finish what he was doing without taking any of my info.  \n\nThere were other people in the waiting area so I ended up having to sit under the TV.  I don't know what show they had on but it was Kyra Sedgwick repeatedly screaming and calling some woman a bitch in a terrible southern accent.  During my time sitting there people with kids were coming and going through the lobby, and I couldn't help but wonder why they thought it was appropriate to have this on.   I would have asked someone to change the channel but everyone was outside working on cars.  Don't get me wrong - I don't have delicate ears - but there are some things a responsible business just doesn't do.\n\nThe rest of the time was spent listening to the phone ringing incessantly, because, like I mentioned, everyone was outside.  \n\nI brought a book to read while I waited but between Kyra screaming and the phone ringing there would be no reading.  Instead I used my time to Yelp another nearby location with higher ratings.  I found one closer to my house and walked out.\n\nI won't come back."
0,This place over charges and the food was not that great.\nIt was not authentic and very americanized chinese.
0,"My husband and I drove by this place and finally decided to stop for lunch. I ordered the Alfredo pasta and he ordered the grilled cheese cheeseburger. Mine came out and was a huge portion with garlic bread. But it was terrible! To the point I couldn't even eat it. The chicken was clearly cooked then frozen, it was so rubbery it would have bounced if I threw it on the ground. Even my husband, who's like a garbage disposal said how terrible it was. His burger though was awesome. He offered to trade me but I was already our off so I didn't. It's one of those places we won't go back to unless were meeting someone who's already there, just wasn't impressed with it. Great atmosphere though and our server was ok. Just not worth the money spent"
1,"I know JUST what you're thinking!\n\nYou: \""Is this not Biff Tannen's Pleasure Paradise Casino and Hotel from the alternate 1985 timeline featured in the hit film Back to the Future 2?\""\n\nMe: \""Yes! Good eye!\""\n\nThis once classy, then shabby, then decently renovated hotel served as the exterior for that wonderful movie, which makes it the perfect destination for both film fanatics AND fans of hypothetical alternate-dystopian-timelines set in the 1980's.\n\nThey say that some nights, when the wind blows just the right way, you can almost hear the actor who played Biff asking you for change from the shadows. That's no illusion! Actor Tom Wilson can often be found lurking just outside the casino."
0,"I wish I could give @Lash a better review.  Their dazzle-dry nail polish product is really great - three weeks and just 2 small chips!!  However, the service is not good, and the manicure itself is super basic (not enough time to soak, no hand massage).  Scheduling an appointment seems to be a challenge.  The first time I called in, I was told the appointment schedule was not there and they would call me back.  Never did, finally I called and scheduled a time. The shop is cute and has character, but the manicure set up could be much better.  I had my mani done on a folding table, feeling pretty uncomfortable.  Scheduled a polish change which was part of the groupon deal, only to get a call to reschedule 2 days before the appointment.  The owner told me they were going to be closed - did they not know it when they scheduled?  I just cancelled the whole thing, there are places with much better service and ease of scheduling.  Too bad, if not for the service, I would have become @Lash's regular."
1,Salami and cheese is so amazing. Best food in the city!
1,so much stuff!
0,"What an adorable restaurant! Loved the decor and the seating.  Very pretty.\n\nGot a sandwich to go. Cost $8. What I got in my styrofoam box was...a sandwich. No pickle. No chips. No little container of cole slaw. Nothing but an $8 sandwich.  To me, this is really unforgivably chintzy. \n\nThe harvest chicken salad was okay but a bit bland. The bread was also rather dry.\n\nSuch a shame. I really, really wanted to like this place so much more, if only to go back and enjoy the atmosphere again. But I guess I won't be headed back.\n\nMayoBird...please take the hint...I've never even SEEN a sandwich as the only item in a to-go box! Even a pickle spear would have turned this into a 3- or 4-star review."
0,"Disappointing restaurant... no wonder they lost the 1 Michellin Star.\n\nUneventful, standard restaurant decor: we had the seats inside for a dinner, not sure what would be the view towards the outside like.\n\nUneventful, standard food: had the 4-course tasting menu with wine pairing, cost about $150 before tax. I can barely remember what I ate when I was recounting the day at night. \n\n- First course: some kind of raw fish sashimi, tiny bits of grilled lobster with grilled pineapple. No taste, goes horribly with the earthy white wine. \n\n- Second course: a scallop on top of a stewed beef. Average but tasty... but you can rarely go wrong with beef stew and scallop.\n\n- Third course: some grilled lamb loin. Forgettable, neither good or bad.\n\n- Fourth course: the grape sorbet is very fresh with a heavy concord grape flavor which I liked. The whole dessert is overly sweet.\n\nOverall, average, uneventful, forgettable after $200 a person. A lot of time tasting menu takes so much time and so many courses I always felt stuffed, but this one I walked out hungry... Won't go back and won't recommend anyone to go."

1,"GC in Verrado has just gone under a ton of changes with staff, menu, and management.  This place has its kick back! \n\nYou can't beat the amount of craft brews on tap. Nice to have a locally owned business providing such great beer. This place has a home-town feel, and reminds me of the show \""Cheers.\"" The servers really try and get to know the guests and provide the best service possible.  \n\nThis place is great for Friday night hangouts, Saturday football games and in-house entertainment, and anytime you want to take a break and have a cold beer after a long days work. Also, the wine list is impeccable.\n\nIf you are looking for a nice night out, come back to GC and check out the changes.  You won't be disappointed."

Neither of ate all of it or even half and didn't want to take it with us. Both of us got chicken, enchiladas with mole for me and tacos for my husband. The chicken was soooooooo dry I couldn't even chew it. We got table side guacamole made with ONE avocado but was $8.50."
0,This is the worst gas station ever. It took them 45 minutes to even touch my car at the car wash. They were 10 cars and two people working. This was a special time of the day. I have been here several times and it takes over an hour and 15 minutes sometimes an hour and a half!
1,"This place is awesome, excited to go back. Will be continuous customer after first visit!"
1,"Had a BoGo so I thought I would try 13 North for the first time. I was very impressed with the food and service. I tried the Prime Dip and was very pleased. A nice portion of beef, cheese and onions on a fresh roll. My other guest enjoyed their meals as well. We've added 13 North to restaurant fave list for sure."
0,Second time here and never will I return. Service is good drinks r good. But there food is just not my type.  Got chicken Chipotle last time n was just tomatoe sauce. Got drunk shrimp today and had no flavor. Sent it back to add some spices still the same. Only ate 1 shrimp that's how bad it was. Sorry but I'm from southern California and this is more for different type of people
1,Food is very good.  Atmosphere is okay.  Staff is tops!
0,"When the server tells you order your food now or because I might not be back in an hour you know you are in trouble.  With that encouragement we had a couple of apps, greasy hummus and volcano wings that I think we more like smoldering hill wings.  Except for the Land Shark there is no reason to go back."
1,"This place is Great I eat there 2 times a week. Great Poke. Great fresh fish including Spicy Yellowtail and Tuna. Great Cooked food, And possibly the best dessert on earth called a Coco Puff. Tell them RN said to try one."
0,"Went in to get my Optima battery checked on my (new to me) auto.  Tech told me the battery was bad.  Tech no longer recommends Optima but that the house brand is better.

In conclusion...Batteries Plus will rip off your grandma.  Beware of the bait and switch."
1,"Overall, I really enjoyed my time here. The bartender/waiter Sean is awesome and very helpful. The beer was good. It was a nice atmosphere and we were able to sit outside and enjoy the nice weather. The food was pretty yummy too. I would definitely recommend this place to others and will be back next time I'm in town."
1,"Old school bar, new school drinks.\n\nI find this bar very interesting. I really thought they would have atomic related drinks. Well, nothing deathly of course. \n\nStopped by one night for some drinks. Only got the cocktails. Reasonably priced for a hip downtown bar. There's a server going around getting people's drinks (thank god). \n\nEntrance is free and so is parking. LOT of parking!\n\nA must stop if you're bar hopping in DTLV."
1,"On this visit, it seems like all the staff changed.  This is not my favorite place for a beef and dog but I was here and I was hungry so in I went.  \n\nThe staff here on this day were awesome, they had personality, they were friendly and really seemed to care about the customers.  They took the time kibitz a little which was a change from my last viisit.  Of course between my last visit and the attempt to order a pizza by phone which I will NEVER do again as the person I talked to was NOT friendly as it states in my previous review.\n\nFor a Chicago place they should cater to customers if they desire to have customers.  Anyway, the beef was really good and super wet as I requested which made this visit good.  \n\nThe prices are reasonable even though I know a place a little farther from my house with the same beefs and dogs but with cheaper prices.  It is sad I cannot order pizza here though as I love chicago pizza because they will not let you substitute anything on a pizza without charging you for the change.  \n\nFortunately there is more then one place in town to get chicago style pizza so this place loosed my business every time when it comes to filling a pizza craving.\n\nFor me when reviewing a place and having a desire to return really depends on the management and this place has never responded to anything on yelp which tells me a lot about a place."
1,Love it here! Great beds...always see amazing results! Staff is VERY knowledgeable and friendly! Good prices and a variety of lotions to chose from at any price point! Have been coming here for months and will continue! So happy to find such a great place so close home!!!
0,"5 Guys and In N Out have nothing to worry about with these guys. My food was cold and those skinny fries, almost as skinny as the can of fries in the grocery store. I had to eat here since the lines were so long. Boy what a disapointment. Must be one of those home town things. The price was right but the burger was bland and needed more seasoning. We have charbroiled burgers all over the L.A. county that taste better and now that 5 Guys is out here to compete we have so many choices in burgerland."
1,"This place smells amazing from the parking lot! I've been a few times & everything I try I always enjoy a lot. The burgers are large & juicy with unique twists & they serve Thai ice tea which is probably my favorite beverage ever. The service is ok, wish it was a little better. I say that because every waiter we've had has no personality. With that said the food always delivers so I would recommend it. \nThe environment plays cool music & it's loud & lively which I enjoy. Casual spot & have been several times to both locations."
1,"Ray's pizza is simple and unassuming. You're going to get big greasy pizza, which feels good to eat, and really, it's very NY.\n\nMy only issue is that when I want hot wings, I expect them be at least tangy.\n\nGood prices, fast speed, and overall , a delicious pie."
0,"what a disappointment, i didn't want to risk the AYCE so i decided to go with a combo meal.  6 wings, fries and a drink for 7.95 plus extra for ranch.  As soon as they charged extra for ranch i should have known.  \n\nThe wings were big, but nothing special at all.  i had the parm garlic wings and it was just wings with parmesan cheese sprinkled on it. my friend had hot bbq and the sauce was nothing memorable.\n\ni would recommend wingstop of buffalo wild wings for sure over this place."
0,"The hotel has an incredible amount of charm.  You get the feeling that you just stepped back in time when you walk into the lobby.  The elevators still have the classic rotating needle that shows what floor the elevator is on.  We stayed in the Governor's Suite, and it too was eking of nostalgia.\nUnfortunately some of the staff members did not have the same amount of charm to match the hotel's architecture and styling.  In particular, everyone we encountered at the front desk did not provide service you would expect at a classic establishment as this.  \nOn the other hand, the Valet Attendant exceeded my expectations.  He was very personable and helpful.  Furthermore, the bartender at the Ghost Lounge was equally personable and made us feel welcome each time we returned.  It appears that he recently purchased the lounge/bar.  He has a great personality and attitude.  I wish him the best.\nThe hotel is known for it's haunted nature.  I was not pleased to hear this.  Some may be attracted by this.  My over active mind kept me thinking of ghosts in the middle of the night. That's just my fault. \nOverall, a historic hotel with a lot of personality.  The hotel might benefit by training the front desk in proper hotel etiquette and professionalism."
1,Been eating here off and on when I am on leave and visiting the family!\nTheir pizza and pasta is great! The service and staff are great also!! Anything you order off the menu you cannot go wrong!
1,"In keeping with my brevity, great food, service a little slow at times.\nMango sticky rice a must."
0,"You know good food only takes a place so far, but good customer service and good food makes a great establishment, which this is not. Long story short; I took some friends to eat here, and the late night prices are unbeatable for the food. We get our food and all 5 of our hash browns orders are practically raw! I told the waiter who didn't show up until after we were finished (Jose P.) about the problem; he asked if I wanted fries!? 30 minutes after we finished eating you don't offer a person fries... talked to the manager on the night shift she really didn't seem to care either. So the next day we went to play some blackjack, and I told the dealer Suzie (Fantastic, she takes your money with grace) about what had happened, as I am a regular at the tables at least 2x weekly. She called her boss over and they gave me 40$ voucher for the cafe. We then saw the same inconsiderate manager the next night and I told her about the voucher, she told me I couldn't have given you a discount since it was already a discounted promotion! I paid money for something that wasn't even cooked, let alone cooked incorrectly. Is she nuts? This place has lost my business going forward, but I will continue to gamble at Green Valley that's for sure. Also I must say the cheese cake is damn good, it crumbles when you eat it, delectable! Just dont expect good service, or cooked food. They cater the Cheese cake thats why its good."
0,"Right when i walked in The carpet smelled like old rag and it makes you want to throw up also the dance floor is super small \n\nMy friend ,not drunk at all, wanted to play with the water near the pool and the security showed us where the restroom was...lied and brought us to the exit saying she can't be in their club because she was too drunk which I have to emphasize that she was NOT which made the guys who came with waste their $30-40\n\nThe alcohol was not strong at all.., once the ice melted it felt like I was drinking cranberry juice or watered down soda \n\nBut anyways they had open bar for girls so I guess it made it up even though guys had to pay for weak alcohol\n\nThe go go dancer or pole dancer was great though she went all the way up towards the ceiling hanging upside down with her legs probably the best thing that happened that night +1 star for the dancer :)"

1,"A visit to Pittsburgh is not complete without stopping to get a fish sandwich at wholey's.  for $6.00 you get a cod sandwich with 2 large batter dipped, deep fried, hot, crispy filets.  I also get a side of smelts and an order of clam strips instead of fries.  Top it off with a glass (now plastic bottle - times change) of buttermilk and you have a real Pittsburgh tradition - well, maybe it's just MY Pittsburgh tradition, but it never disappoints.\n\nFor the life of me, I cant figure out why people go to primanti's for a flavorless starch sandwich when they can get one of the best fish sandwiches on the planet!\n\nThe market is fun too.  They have an impressive selection of fish and meats.  Not super fancy, but out of the ordinary."
0,"I was coming here weekly to get an Oxygen session. I'm a local so even referred people. Bought an $11 can of Oxygen and went to take it back and the horrible experience of not being able to EXCHANGE IT was enough to NEVER come back. They obviously won't be around a long time if they choose money over service. You just lost a consistent customer and they didn't care. Don't waste your money. Also, go buy a \""Tens\"" unit at a Medical supply if you want a massager for half the price of what they are selling a massager for. It's a BIG waste of money!"
1,"3.5*\nI've been to Bluewater a couple times now, and I've had some great food and some that's been so-so.  Our first visit I had the pan seared scallops and my buddy had the miso salmon.  We both really enjoyed our meals, not to mention killer oysters rockefeller and sourdough bread!\nOur last visit (in addition to the aforementioned oysters and sourdough of course) I tried the prawn and scallop skewer and my buddy tried the chinook.  Now, to me anyway, prawn=BIG shrimp U-15 like. But alas, these were more akin to 21-25.  The food was not hot when I got it which definitely detracted from the dish.  The chinook was average.\nSo, in closing I'd say oysters, chowder and bread will probably be my next meal at Bluewater, never been disappointed in those."
0,"The ice cream here tastes old and funny.  That semi-melted, semi-freezer burnt almost gooey and just plain old wrong texture.  One bite and I tossed it out.  The store is filthy.  The customer service is horrible.  Save yourselves and go to the gelato place down the road, or better yet inside one of the many stores that line Sahara or Charleston and grab a pint of Ben and Jerry's."
1,Never suggested unnecessary treatment.  Always on time.  Friendly and comfortable.  Highly recommend.
1,"Loved it!! My hubby and I both had burgers on pretzel buns. The burgers were fantastic! As a side I got a salad which was really good. The service was great, our server was fast, accurate and very sweet. For a small neighborhood sports grill this place is tops."
0,"Today I notice a Toyota Prius (White) with California License Plates (plate number 6RRM802) illegally parked in the Handicap Parking Space in front of this store -- it was the third time this week that the same car has been parked there.  I went inside to inquire if they knew who owned the vehilce, and a very nice young man responded that it was the \""owner\"" so he really could not say anything about the illegal parking.\n\nThen a lady came from the back of the store and asked if I was the guy that was complaining about her parking.  I indicated that I was, and she said she was not really parked there (yet the vehicle was not running, and nobody was in the car -- I guess she has a different definition of parking).  I asked her if she realized that she was in a Handicap Parking Space and she acknowledged that she did know that, and did not really care.  She then asked me if I felt better about myself and I indicated that I was fine, and asked if she felt good about herself parking in a Handicap parking Space -- she said she was fine with.\n\nPeople, we need to collectively do something about this.  The owner of business intentionally parking in a disabled spot, and making no apologies for doing so, and to top it off she owns a business in Arizona and does not have Arizona Plates on her vehicle  ... I say we should all boycott this location of Edible Arrangements ...\n\nI am only giving one star, because YELP requires you to give at least one star."
1,"Love Kona Grill's Happy Hour menu. I've been to Chandler and Scottsdale and love both locations. Most sushi places I go to their HH food menu only provides deep fried dishes which I rarely order from. I usually order non-deep fried rolls because I can taste how fresh the stuff I eat. Kona Grill has wide variety of selections on their HH menu. Sake Sangria was perfect for me as I like drinks that are fruity. The Vegetable rolls were good and I can taste the freshness of the vegetables. Chicken Satay, the chicken was tender and juicy. Beef Bulgogi Tacos, beef was wrapped with a soft shell with some shredded cabbage, carrots and some other veg/plants. This will be my go to place for sure."
1,"I loved Zeke's \""Hot Yoga\"" classes.  He has a great personality--I wonder where he's teaching now?\n\nApril 2007 Update:\nI MISS THIS PLACE SOOOO MUCH!!!!!!!!!!!   You can't find a better instructor than Sascha.  I really miss her hot yoga class.  It's transcendental."
0,"I am a regular shopper of Brighton jewelry.  I don't know why I continue to go into this particular store in San Tan Mall!  I am rarely greeted when I enter the store.  They act as if you are an inconvenience and have hassled my TWO returns WITH RECEIPT! I have had to deal with the difficult woman, Hilary, both times.  I brought it to attention of store manager.  I keep saying I will drive all the way to Chandler. They clearly do not understand the importance of exceptional service in these days. So, to Chandler location from now on!"
0,"First things first....my boyfriend and I walked into this dump and politely asked to see a menu. We were given a dirty look and a grunt from the ho-bag looking hostess...(who we learned is also the server, busser, probably owner)...That should have been our first clue to leave, but we were so hungry at this point that we decided to give it a try anyway. Next thing we know, we were seated at a dingy 1970s looking table with duct tape on the seats. The waitress practically threw two menus at us, and then once we asked, brought us the most disgusting, chlorine tasting tap water. We ordered pot stickers, a bowl of Pho, and lemongrass chicken with rice. When she brought us the pot stickers, once again she threw them at us and when we thanked her, she grunted like a caveman, as if she had done extraordinary task. When we asked for plates to eat our dumplings from, she said, \""WHA YOU WAN NOW?!\"" Very friendly. The pot stickers were edible. That is the best thing I have to say about this review. Next came our entrees. My lemongrass chicken contained neither lemongrass nor chicken....strange, I know, There was a heaping pile of mediocre rice along with disgusting tendon filled chewy inedible chicken in a spicy jalapeno sauce....not what I ordered. My boyfriend felt so bad when he saw the look on my face, that he shared his Pho with me...The soup was ok...definitely better than my dish. The waitress passed by 10 times, noticing that I didn't even touch my food and had moved across the table to share my boyfriend's lunch, leaving that horrid dish of chicken knuckles and beaks...she didn't say anything...on the contrary, she attempted to avoid us, as to not have to confront the situation. Finally, when she came to clear the plates, she said \""everything ok?\"" I said that the chicken was full of tendons and I couldn't eat it. Her response was to say, \"" Some people like it that way better\"" and \""All the chicken here is like that. Some people like that better.\"" \""RIGHT. OK?\""\n\nThis circus freak/owner/waitress/Britney Spears wannabe is a disgusting human being who should not have a job dealing with food and/or people. We had a good laugh when she was cleaning the table across the aisle from us. Her mini skirt had not been able to cover her skid-marked panties, but it is sort of like a train wreck, we stared in an amazing stupor of horror and disgust. I'm sure there is a single word to describe our experience, I'm just not sure i know it, possibly heinous or perhaps vile. In any case I will never forget the cartoon ridiculousness of this hell hole.\n\nSTAY AWAY!!!!!!!"
1,"I booked a Hoover Dam Kayaking tour in late September ($237 for 2 people).  This included pick up from the hotel, a McDonalds breakfast, an Arbys sandwhich, and transportation back to the hotel.\n\nOur tour guide, Alex, arrived at 6am on the dot as promised in front of our hotel (MGM Grand).  He was very friendly and efficiently made his way to the other hotels to pick up our other kayakers. \n\nFrom there, we stopped at McDonalds where we ordered what we wanted and was paid for by the tour guide.  We ate the Mickey D's on the way there.  Once we got to our destination, the Hoover Dam, we drove down right to the base of it and got our Kayaks loaded into the water. \n\nWe pretty much paddled down 11 miles with about 4 or 5 stops in between to check out the sites, take a break, and have lunch.  The experience was made by the friendliness and knowledge of our tour guide Alex, who was always there to help and guide.  We hung out at a couple of hot springs and Alex had our lunch packed in his Kayak with some ice.\n\nI would recommend bringing water shoes on an excursion like this - you are getting in and out of the kayak a lot and stepping into the water as you get out.  \n\nAt the end of the trip, Alex loaded all of the Kayaks back on to the truck himself while we relaxed and he drove us back to our hotels.  He never once solicited a tip like I have been when I booked with another company.  Overall, I will definitely use this company again next time I am in Vegas and recommend it to others.  At the end of the day, as friendly as the guide was, he realized this was a business and his first priority was the customer and he never forgot that."
1,"Just can't get enough of this place! \n\nWhether it's their Corned Beef Hash, Sage Chicken & waffles or the Kokomo sandwich (btw which is my favorite), this place is one the few places in Vegas that will hit you with a massive food coma at 8 in the morning!"
0,"Ok, I have way better Chinese style Western food in Los Angeles.\nI will say half of the dishes in its menu are soso or not good. Half of them meets my expectation.\nThe owner/chef is always proud of his cooking skill. He is too arrogant like a frog lives inside the well but has never been the outside world.\nActually for some of his dishes, I can make better than he does. \nI give it  2 stars."
0,"I needed to exchange a gift my mom gave me so I looked around the clothing for something to replace it.\n\nFirst, when going to customer service I was standing there and the girl seemed like she was with a customer chatting and after a while of standing there it was pretty clear she was chatting with a friend. After a while she told him \""let me help the customer\""....uh, ya think? So unprofessional. \n\n I didn't really find anything that perked my interest and feel that the selection at this Macy's isn't that great....there were whole sections of clothes I didn't even bother with because they weren't what I would consider even style (majority is just branded bullshit or things a 15year old would wear or old peoples clothing). I looked through not just clothes, but also scanned through bags  and jewelry, just anything so I can spend the store credit. \n\nI almost always find something at other locations. I guess I have to go to Fashion Show or wait til I'm back in California."
0,"Maybe I jumped the gun by suggesting to have brunch here last Sunday. I usually wait for a new restaurant to be open a few months before trying it, but I sometimes make an exception if there are rave reviews. In this rare occasion Yelp had failed me.\n\nMy husband and I had met my friend here and we shared 3 different plates. It wasn't noted that this was \""tapas\"" style on the menu at all, nor was it suggested how to order, so we thought 3 dishes for 3 people would be enough food. For drinks my husband had a Sleepy Dog Hefeweizen, my friend a cocktail and I ordered a mimosa which was a pretty good deal at $5. My husband and friend's drinks came out immediately, while I was told they were waiting for a bottle of champagne to open. About 10 minutes later I received my drink. \n\nTwo of our orders arrived first, the tuna poke and the lamb kimchi fried rice. Our server then came over  told us that their computers had gone down, and due to the error he gave us a complimentary pig ear pad thai. We said \""Thank you\"" as it's always nice to have that type of error work in your favor. He put the plate down on the table and as we were about to dig in another staff member walked up to our table and took the pig ear plate away without saying a word........awkward. The server apologized for the mistake, as it must have been a misunderstanding. We started our meal and then the staff member came back a few minutes later and put the pig ear plate back on our table again without saying a word. We were somewhat apprehensive of eating it a this point, was it going to be taken away again? Anyway beggars can't be choosers, I was very appreciative of the complimentary entree, but the awkwardness that came with it really wasn't worth it.\n\nAs for the food: the tuna poke was fresh tasting, but flavor wise it was nothing really special. The lamb kimchi fried rice tasted good, but was greasy and had the teeniest tiniest pieces of lamb in it. Our third order was the poutine, this was the best thing we had, it had a flavorful cream sauce, chunks of lamb and a runny egg. The pig ear pad thai was pretty good too, nice & crispy and came with pickled veggies. \n\nSo why two stars? The portions sizes were laughable, each entree was about 5 bites max. We weren't informed that one dish per person isn't even close to enough food. We ended up having an extra dish due to the snafu, but we still all left hungry. It would be one thing if the food was amazing, then I would want to order more dishes, but nothing was very memorable or fantastic enough. The price point did not match the portion at all. The service was also lacking, the server took our credit card to run it, and then waited a good 20 minutes to receive it back after having to ask for it. Sorry but I can't see myself returning."
0,"Hated it. Dirty, nasty, things left in fridge & bathroom from prior guest. Smells like cigarettes all in hallway & room. Will never stay here again!"
0,Everytime I visit there I wait at least 45 minutes before I make it through the waiting room door. Dr. Arnold has removed cancer from me twice. This last time I waited for 90 minutes and never made it through the door. Three other people who were there before me were still waiting. He gets high marks in skill. His office staff rates a zero for overbooking and rudeness. His bedside manner could use improving but his skill level outweighs that. His skill level does not excuse the length of time waiting. Doctor you are Fired!
1,"Spicy Pickle is a semi-regular lunch stop for me.  It's close to the office, and until last week, I could snag covered parking.  No more, now all the formerly open spots are \""reserved\"".  Drat.  I've only had one thing here, the \""Classico Pizzetti\"", which is a complicated way of saying \""pepperoni pizza\"".  It's very thin and very fresh, and suits my appetite just right.  The crust is great and there's something about the seasoning in the sauce that hits the spot for me.  Someday I'll get adventurous and order something else from the menu."
0,"Placed a rather simple pick up order-small pepperoni pizza.  I was not told a price on the phone, I figured it would be in the 10 dollar range.  Lesson learned, never assume anything!  When i got there, I paid over 15$, which, I'm sorry is EXCESSIVE!   They need to sprinkle gold or something on there to make it worth the money at that price.  Either way, I paid since I did order it and figured if it was a really good pizza it was worth it.  Needless to say I was further disappointed when I got home and started eating it-now, I don't have extremely high standards when it comes to pizza-I love dominos, pizza hut, you name it-but the sauce was bland and had no taste to it. I lived in Boston for many years and have visited NYC many times; believe me when I tell you, this place has nothing, and I mean NOTHING in common with NY pizza.  I was disappointed and won't be back."
1,"Love their nachos, since they are loaded with steak, guacamole, cheese, refried beans, etc. etc. They have all the good stuff and you can also share the portion since it's massive! Their stuffed \""chiles\"" are delicious and so are their tortas ( I prefer steak, with refried beans, and all the trimmings to go along), topping it off with their horchata. A side bar of sliced fresh veggies is always there, offering you pickled carrots with onions and jalape\u00f1os. I enjoy this place since its cheap and tasty!"
0,"I've been to BRGR a few times now, and each time I walk away thinking that it should be called MLKSHK or APPTZR, because there's nothing good about their burgers, themselves.\n\nI'm a big fan of the salty caramel milkshake with bourbon, and the fried pickles are really good, but everything else that I've ever tried has always fallen flat, from the ahi burger...to a regular burger...to the sante fe hippie veggie burger. I've tried REALLY hard to be impressed, but it's just not happening. The buns are dry, the burgers are overpriced, and the flavors are simply lacking the interest to justify going back. If I'm paying a premium price for an a la carte burger, there are better establishments in Pittsburgh to choose from.\n\nNot to mention, the beer prices at BRGR are laughable. $7 for a Strongbow bottle? You've got to be kidding me. I guess they've got to get all the money out of you during your visit since the food isn't going to be bringing you back."
0,"RUDE - we chose this place from an article a friend read. Our waiter had an attitude, I never knew a vegetable could have NO taste and don't even think about getting two separate checks if they already put it in the computer. Found much better food and service at Olive - I suggest that instead!"
1,"From a warm weather dish of Tuna/Salmon salad to a cold weather Ramen, or 48 hour pork, or the heavenly beef rib this wonderful and friendly resto has it all. Rediscover Japanese cuisine here. As for the service, you will never wait long before receiving your plate of awesome but sometimes, just sometimes you will get your meal before your appetizer. I've survived worse things; so will you.\n\nAs for avoiding the line-ups, there are strategies that work nicely but there's no way that I'm going to share those secrets with you people. Nope, nope, and another bucketful of nope."
1,"I rated this doctor's office a 5 star office because I absolutely adore Dr. Stewart. I have been seeing him for over 20 years, since I was a child. He has seen apart every member of my family also. He has taken the time to get to know each of us. It is so nice to visit a doctor that already knows and remembers your family history, medication, and medical conditions. I have seen other doctors, due to insurance changes over the years, and been so upset by my experiences. Now my insurance choices are based solely on whether or not I will continue to be able to see him! He is hands-down the best doctor in the valley!"
1,"What can I say that has not already been said, this park is open remodeled home to the most awesome fountain in the city. \n\nLots of events happen yearly here, its where the Pittsburgh marathon ends, home to the arts fest. It is easily accessible by foot, bicycle, car, stork, kayak and train. Ok maybe not train. It has great views of the North shore and Mount Washington. \n\nBladee Blah none of that even matters because right now there is a huge rubber ducky down there. As part of a visiting art exhibit, he is wise he is awesome, he is the star of Point State Park and he won't be there long. \n\nOh he has only been here a few nights but Imagine everything he gets to see! Ask him anything.... will the pirates keep winning? Will the Steelers ever start to win again? Did that swerving speed boat get out of the way before that coal barge hit it? How many kayaks peppered the river today? Go ahead make his day. He looks pretty cool through the fountain mist as well."
1,"I like a lot of things about this place.\n\n1. It is the only place that I can really stomach in the whole NC music factory complex. I like going here before the comedy zone.\n\n2. If you have friends with kids- this is a great place to go with children during the day. They have a giant chess set and some games. Kids can run around and get away with a lot. I once went here before some sort of Disney kids concert and it was packed with children dodging pints of beer.\n\n3. It is HUGE. This is good if you are meeting up for a birthday or with a large group. This is a pet peeve of mine- only some places can really handle a giant group. This place can handle it.\n\n4. It is corny- but I do love the rip off Banksy art work.\n\n5. The beer selection is solid. There are also non beer choices. It is priced well.\n\n6. POTATO LATKES ARE DELICIOUS. The pretzel and beer cheese is also fantastic. The menu isn't huge, but it is good bar food.\n\n7. If it is too hot- they have covered areas and fans. If it is too cold- they have heaters. \n\nThe negative:\n\nWHY OH WHY do you not invest in more plants/flowers? Go to a local nursery or home depot. Blow $500 on plants and it would make a huge transformation. I cannot for the life of me understand why this hasn't happened. They put in a volley ball section- but still- the plants are just sad. Please add more plants. It needs it."

0,"I've gotten subs from jersey mikes before and gave them another chance after consecutive lukewarm experiences. However I got the wrong sub and am regretting it again. Their breads are way too soft to be making pastrami sandwiches with thousand island dressing and it was soggy and non-edible. the meat was ok but not all the hype they get. Again, maybe I got the wrong sandwich but I'm surprised they even make it like that. Id rather go to Jasons deli."
0,"I used to have one of those Gourmet Society cards and their website told me I could get a 25% discount at Chop Chop. Excellent. I had friends coming to stay and they had all heard of the place and wanted to try it. So I rang and booked a table and told them on the phone that I had the card. They said it would be fine to use it. You've got to love a discount!\n\nThere were four of us and we are not good decision makers so we ended up opting for the unlimited banquet for four. Lots of variety and you can have seconds (and thirds, fourths and probably fifths if you could fit them in - it's unlimited after all) at no extra cost. Hurrah! The food arrived in a higgledy piggledy kind of way in no particular order but that was fine as there were so many different dishes it was rather nice to be able to sample them a couple at a time. It was all delicious and we had second helpings of several different things. I was tempted by third helpings but was pretty full at that point so exercised some restraint.\n\nAnd then we asked for the bill. And this is where it all went wrong. When I got out my Gourmet Society card I was abruptly told that they no longer accepted them and we couldn't have our discount. I protested saying that I had been told on the phone that it would be ok. The waiter went to get the manager who came out and spent some time angrily grilling me on who I had spoken to when I booked the table (what day did I call, what time, did I speak to a man or woman, what accent did they have...?). I tried to be as vague as possible because, clearly, someone was going to be in a lot of trouble and I didn't want to be responsible for that. Eventually he grudgingly let us have the discount but by then the damage had been done. \n\nI had high hopes for Chop Chop but now have the impression that, though they serve lovely food, they treat their staff really really badly. Never say never... but I'd certainly be reluctant to spend my money there again."
0,"I ate here the other night with three dining companions.  We decided on this place after deciding to meet up at New York New York.\n\nMy dining companions split both the edamame and star wontons for appetizers.  Since I had eaten recently, I personally did not partake in either of them but my friends raved about both appetizers.  For my entree I decided upon the Mongolian beef.  Having ordered it the waiter informed me that I would not get rice with it and would I like to order a side of it. I politely declined. My Mongolian beef consisted of steak and chives in a sauce with crispy noodles, cucumber and carrots on the side.  The cut of meat was a little better than I was used to in such dishes and the sauce was good.  However I found the dish to be weird, especially the cucumber pieces.  The only other thing of note is that my friends ordered three sushi rolls.  They were disappointed with the size of them but raved about the flavors.\n\nThe bottom line for me is that I would probably not eat here again.  The food was just ok and I feel like better food could be found for the price."
1,"I really enjoy Goldies (and Zipps) for their cheap beers, low-key atmospheres, and decent food.  We always go upstairs as we don't have to wait for a table and that's where the pool tables, shuffleboard, darts and buck-hunter are.  I go there a lot with a group of friends that just enjoys hanging out without feeling like we have to get crazy...although sometimes we do anyway.  \n\nOne word of caution:  The last two times I've been there my wings (medium buffalo) have come out with pink in the middle.  Both times the server immediately took them back and brought me a new plate of wings on-the-house.  The second plate was always cooked all the way through."
0,"First of all, they offered me a beer as part of my complimentary beverage options.  Amazing.  Love it.\n\nNow, to the terrible part.  I did not get the haircut I asked for, not even close.  I asked for face framing layers and I received a short layer that went around the crown of my head.  I have curly hair, so you can imagine what that looked like.  \n\nI did not notice how bad the cut was, because it was straightened when I left.  As it curled up, I realized how bad it looked.  I asked for one, very important thing.  Please, make it a wash, blow dry and go look.  I am someone with a very fast paced life style.  I now have to take 30-45 minutes each day to actually style my hair.  \n\nI have my portraits for law school coming up and my hair is terrible.  It has been nearly three months and waiting for this hair style to grow out has been excruciating.  There is NO saving the current hair style and its current lengths.  Yes, that is plural.  \n\nI am a person who dresses very simple and sophisticated. I am not a hipster who wants her hair to be chopped and trendy.  It was awful.  $25 for a haircut.  I guess you get what you pay for.  \n\nI emailed the person who cut my hair and all she did was recommend one of their overpriced products.  I am offended.  \n\nI cried after this haircut.  Literally, sobbed.  Why can't I find any place that can cut curly hair?"
0,"I've been to Umiya a few times. The first time was outstanding. The fish was fresh and flavorful, the service attentive, and there's a decent menu selection for AYCE. Excited to have found a great new sushi place, I went back to try the lunch specials, which were also great. However, over the last few months the quality and service have taken a nosedive. \n\nA friend and I were in on a Sat night for AYCE dinner. We were seated promptly even though it was somewhat busy, but we hadn't even got our coats off before someone came to take our order. Clearly not ready yet. Then, when we were ready, despite the army of staff, no one came. I'll spare the extensive list of service fails throughout the evening, but it's really the service that is earning the 2 star rating here. Basically, we didn't get what we ordered the first time, were unable to get someone to take a follow up order, had food thrown down on the table by servers on their way to somewhere else, and were overcharged. To top it off, the fish was bland and the portion sizes had shrunk from previous visits. I'd rate the food about 2.5 stars. Time to scratch this one off the list. There's just so many better places in town."
0,"Atmosphere, alcohol, and service.  If that's all your looking for, then you've found a nice spot.  However, if you intend on eating I'd suggest you continue driving down the street to one of the many Scottsdale restaurants that will deliver a much better meal.  \n\nWe were part of a large party with a pre-ordered dinner, so perhaps this played into the quality....really hard to say.  Our grilled romaine salad tasted very reminiscent of those days when my father would douse the bbq with lighter fluid and then attempt to tell us later the flavor that was strangely burning our tongues was \""outdoor grilling at it's best\"".  Sorry, but it didn't work for Dad and it didn't work last night either.  I thought that perhaps the salad was a fluke, but unfortunately the disappointment continued through the bland spaghetti-o like pasta and the easy bake oven version of dessert.  \n\nIf any of the food had displayed the slightest bit of potential, I would have been happy to give them another shot.  But life is short and there's too many other restaurants putting forth a much better effort."
0,"The food is not that great. The mac and cheese had absolutely no flavor, and the salad I ordered was nothing special and looked like something I could have made at home myself. My friend ordered a salad and didn't like it, so she sent it back. The waitress asked if she would like anything else instead and my friend declined. When the bills came they charged my friend for the salad. The waitress explained that her manager said that since there was nothing wrong with the food that he was not going to take the salad off of her bill. The waitress was very polite and felt very bad for my friend, but stated her manager refused to allow her to take the salad off of the bill. \n Way to have crappy customer service on top of not so fabulous food that is served on PLASTIC plates. I will never go back to this place ever again. Have fun serving students that are ok with flavorless and not so fabulous food. This is probably the only way you will end up staying in business."
0,Ordered a sesame seed bagel and got a multigrain and only one side had Creme cheese on it. No one else was in the drive thru but me so this was just pure carelessness. Their stupidity amazes me..!
1,"This is probably one of my favorite boba spots in town. Here's why...\n\n1. They have a huge variety of drinks to offer. Every drink I've had has been good. My latest discovery was the Oreo oolong milk tea. It has tiny pieces of Oreo, so it gives you that hint of it plus the oolong gives it that creaminess. So good! And I love that you can customize the amount of sugar in any drink. \n2. The employees are so friendly and patient. They greet everyone that walks in and offer suggestions if you're indecisive. When they make you're drink, they ask if it's ok so they can make any adjustments to the sweetness or anything. \n3. The decor is so cute. The little king fu characters by the bar are super cute. And the wall art by local artists are cool to look at. (You can purchase the wall art. The price is listed right next to it.) \n4. They are open late, so you can satisfy you're boba craving late at night. \n5. Free topping with Yelp check in!! Score!!!! Who doesn't love free boba?!?!\n\nNow for why I docked a star...\n1. It's located in a super busy plaza, so parking can be a disaster. \n2. When you walk in, the register is right there. So if there's a line, the entrance/exit can get backed up. Can you say fire hazard? \n3. Their boba texture is inconsistent. Some times it perfectly chewy. And other times, like when we went last night, can be on the harder side. \n4. There's only a few tables, so it's hard to sit and relax. Especially if they are busy and there are a lot of people in there, yeah it's kind of cramped and chaotic. \n\nOverall, solid boba spot for sure and I'll definitely be back frequently."
1,"Went to The Keg with my wife as she had never been and Flemings was booked.  The staff was very accommodating and friendly.  The server was excellent.  He checked in often, presented himself very well and was attentive to our needs.  We had a bottle of Ridge that was delicious.  The brie appetizer was very good.  Now onto the steak:  Each of us ordered a bacon wrapped filet medium rare.  Unfortunately, the steak came wrapped in bacon fat and was cooked closer to rare vs medium rare.  At times I'll order my steak rare or rare + so this wasn't a problem for me, but the bacon grizzle was unappetizing.  We had the creme brulee for dessert and it was average.  The Keg does a good job, but if the could pay a little more attention to detail with respect to the food.  I think they try and turn out the food too fast and it just doesn't compare to other steak houses.  Definitely a AAA club.  If you want a real steak go to Flemings or Ruth Chris for a Big League experience."
0,"A dingy smokey old casino.  I never stayed here, because if they can't  keep their casino up to date, I can imagine that their rooms are the same.  I've received comps, but still refuse to come because of this and mainly because it's not on the strip.  They don't do enough to lure me back.  Slot players like the place because of the variety of the slots and they seem to have newer machines,  But I'm not a slot player.  So, come here for cheap tables, but those can be found at nicer off strip casinos like Orleans, Palms and the adequate Rio."
1,"I love Kabob-G. I've really never had anything that I've disliked there - the house dressing is delicious, love the Tabboolee, Falfel sandwich is great, I get the vegetarian grape leaves a lot and love them too!\nThe waitress is funny and remembers who I am (and my boyfriend) and always knows what we want. I'm able to walk there but I can see that parking might be an issue for some people."
1,"Best Thai Food in Las Vegas by far. Be prepared to wait because this place does get busy. It's for alot of locals but if you know places to go in Vegas it's a must stop. If you order the papaya salad make sure to scale how spicy you want it made because it can't get off the charts. Order the garlic prawn, its semi deshelled but the shell is fried crispy enough to eat. It's my favorite dish and so far the best shrimp I have ever had. I been trying to find places in Houston that carries this but so far haven't found on yet. I'm definetly a fan for life. Must try this place if visit Vegas."
0,"Decided to eat here for breakfast before we made our way back to Los Angeles. \n\nEXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED!!!\n\nNever going to eat here again and never going to recommend anyone I know to eat here. \n\nInitially, the price you pay ($47.00 for 2) didn't seem too bad. You expect it to be that price. It's a buffet right? When you take your first lap around the buffet you'll notice how dismal the selections are. There's breakfast cereal... BREAKFAST CEREAL!!! I just paid $23 to have fruit loops?!? Then that's when you realize the price is ridiculous. \n\nIf you continue on you'll notice each station has some sort of an egg dish. Lobster frittata, scrambled eggs, egg white only, eggs benedict, and then an omelet station?!? Who can eat so many eggs and how lazy do you have to be that you can't come up with any other dish other than plain egg whites?!?\n\nAfter bypassing the numerous egg dishes and the prepared cereal bowls of frosted flakes and fruit loops, I went looking for the lox and bagels. I find the station and a line of people thinking that maybe the lox are really good. I remember them being pretty good so I make my way over to the line. I get to the line only to find that people are waiting for the staff to put more lox out. The woman in front of me says that she's been back and forth from her table several times hoping that they had replaced the lox. She went on to say she's been waiting for at least 40 minutes. 40 MINUTES!!! We ask the man behind the glass to put more out and all he says is \""more coming.\"" Yes we know, but WHEN?!?\n\nThis is where I decided to tell my wife to finish her plate and to stop eating because we were going to wait 45 minutes at our table drinking only our coffee and juice and drive off to go have breakfast elsewhere.\n\nSeriously people... DO NOT WAT HERE!!!"
1,"The Bistec Con Mole, Pescado a la Plancha taco, and MOST of all, the whimsical and expert bartender Sarah were absolutely first class and exceptionally unique.  What a surprise for anyone who values a little magic in their food as well as their drink. Just go. You will be surprised."
0,If you love getting lied to and ripped off then this is the place for you! The manager George told me that I received full synthetic oil but the technician told me that he installed standard 10w 30 and admitted  that George lies all the time. Really nice George!!
1,"Wide selection of Korean dishes to chose from.  Very clean restaurant with prompt service.  Nice decor.  The kalbi was good along with the array of dishes- my only complaint was that the kim chi wasn't spicy.  I mean, it was totally red and you could see the chili pepper flakes but it wasn't spicy, not one bit. So weird."
1,"impressed.  burgers were solid.  went with a buddy and after we each finished our burger, we ordered another to share as our dessert."
1,Shira is the best! I have been coming in for 2 years and always look forward to my time with her. I was so nervous coming but she always makes good conversation and makes the process as quick and painless as possible. \nI am moving out of state soon and would take her with me if I could!! Sad to say goodbye to her.
0,"Crossing Charlie's Lakeside off my list. Online they show breakfast specials until 6am, so at 5am this morning we decide we will go out for breakfast. Get to Charlie's and tell the Bartender we would like the Bacon Egg special ($1.99) only to be told they no longer do breakfast specials.  Not only didn't they have specials any more but they had to make coffee. No wonder the place was empty."
0,So grossed out by this restaurant. Extremely pricey and disgusting when you walk in. CLEAN your restaurant or hire new staff.
1,"Yeah, this place is pretty old and has obviously never received a renovation, ahhh so much better than Pure!\n\nPros:\n1. $1 cans of Busch, what a great beer\n2. Three crappy pool tables, I think they might even be 50 cents\n3. Colorful clientele\n\nCons:\n1. If you park at the El Cortez, like I usually do, you WILL encounter some whack people on your walk down the street.  Hookers, tweekers, scowling police officers, you name it.\n2. If you don't get there by right about 9pm they won't let you in, so plan accordingly.  Seriously?  Ugh, one star deduction!\n3. It's pretty damn smokey in this place."
0,"I am going to state upfront that I have rated the Genius Bar with 2 stars because the person assisting with getting people appointments, and getting people to their appointments couldn't even make eye contact with us when we were speaking with him to attempt to get an appointment. I guess I realize that you are a genius (supposedly) but this is not the place to play out your brooding. It is a customer service gig..... so I would suggest either getting your head outta the tablet surfing Apple Store internet and get some people skills.\n\nOK, rant complete. On to the Genius Bar... the technician that helped us was knowledgeable, and resolved my \""temperamental\"" iPhone If-you-don't-turn-me-off-every-few-days-or-so-I'll-turn-myself-off-and-lock-you-out-for-HOURS tantrum. However, following in the steps of the Genius Bar Host, she wasn't very friendly either. She kinda spoke to me like Help Desk technicians speak to people who shouldn't be using computers that call them with stupid questions like \""My computer wont come on\""\nTechnician: Did you turn it on?\nCustomer: Oh.... no I guess I didn't. \nWell, I am not a computer idiot but there are ALOT of things about iPhones that elude me; and many others from what I have googled. So to treat the people that have come to you for your unattainable knowledge (outside of the new hire training course) like rocks isn't very pleasant.\nThank you so much Apple Genius for restoring my iPhone child to its ordinary operating behavior but maybe next time we could get a smile or giggle outta ya?"
0,I was forced to be at a table on Friday night by the bouncer in order to get in without waiting in line.  Another guy at the table terrorized me and was extremely hostile and aggressive with me.  I told the bouncers but I don't think anything happened.  This is not a safe place for a beautiful woman.  The guys get off on bullying petite women.
1,"Number 1 tip:  Come here starving - not hungry.\n\nFor those of you that have never been to a Brazilian steak house.  It is an all you can eat steak / meat place, where the servers come around with various cuts of meats on large swords.  The meats range from filet mignon wrapped in bacon to chicken and cheese and everything in between.\n \nYou must try the Brazilian cheese breads.  They are chewy and very cheesy.  They also fried plantains - which makes a good side, the sweetness will cut through the saltiness and richness of the meats.  I wish they would also serve the fried cassava / yucca - which can be found all the competitors.\n \nThey also have a full salad bar, with an abundance of meats, cheeses, pastas, and veggies.  A must for me here - the smoked salmon.\n\nPlease note that dessert is not included the meal - that's if you even have room for it."
0,"I signed up for 2 separate accounts with the Owner Eric Owen (the owner) It was a combined fee of 5,000 a month.  When I received the first list of Keywords they were terrible. Originally Eric told me that he had personally reviewed them and then after I went over them with him he said that they were \""trash\""  They sent me another list later and again I had to meet with Eric and his team. The case manager could not tell me what words we would prioritize and I again had to cross out many of the words since they had to do with places I didn't do business and for hotels in cities I don't even have a business in.  I was told by Eric that my request was \""Very Reasonable\"" to ask for what keywords would be mapped to which pages of my website. I left for a trip the following few days and when I was able to get internet to review the keywords nothing that Eric promised me was delivered.  I was upset and felt like they had broken the contract for lack of performance.  Eric agreed we were not a good fit... Imagine my surprise when they held 5,000.00 of my money even after they didn't deliver.   During my last meeting with Erica I was promised the Keyword list that he had told me he saw in his office that day... I received an email he needed to find out from his employees what was going on and that I would get the work I had paid for by the next week.... That was the LAST I ever heard of Fasturtle    5K for a terrible keyword list and broken promises...."
1,"This is my go-to late night reverse happy hour location!! Awesome menu, usual great service, and great happy hour prices!\n\nThis town square location my usual spot. I will on occasion go to the red rock location if I'm in that area. But town square is the go to. \n\nEvery time I come, it's usually always busy. Meaning I've never come on an empty night. Still receive great service and seated within an acceptable amount of time. There are great for large parties! ***side note: if you have a large party, be patient with them some servers look and act annoyed** I've come in with a party over 30 and they always accommodate us. (We come after we  perform in shows) \n\nLike I said I love the reverse happy hour menu so honestly that's the only things I've ever tried... And their dessert! Yummy! My absolute favorite is the Garlic Chicken Noodle!!! I see it more as a meal than an appetizer! Lo mein type noodles with chicken chunks accompanied by garlic flavor, edamame seeds, Parmesan cheese toppings, shiitake mushrooms, chunks of tofu, and sliced asparagus!!! Who wouldn't love that?! It's absolutely delicious and just the right amount of garlic flavor. \n\nAll of their happy hour appetizers are a must try. Their half off pizzas are delicious, and my other favorite go to meal is the Ahi-poke Stack. Perfectly lightly wasabi coated ahi tuna chunks stacked on wonton wafers accompanied with carrot and radish slices all lightly coated in the soy and wasabi ginger sauce with slices of fresh avocado on the side!!  \n\nWhen I order just the chicken garlic noodles and the poke stack during happy hour, with tip and tax included I walk out paying $15. Can't beat that!!! \n\nNot to mention to amazing beer selection they have available!! Pear Cider is my go to! \n\nTry everything on their appetizer menu! I promise they do not disappoint"
0,"We have enjoyed our previous visits to this Red Robin, but the last 2 trips have revealed inattentive servers.  Last night our food arrived via a manager, but we had no silverware or napkins.  As our server Brittany was no where to be found, we began our meal with fingers.  Finished our meal, dirty plates stacked on our table, along with empty drink glasses.  Britney walked by about 13 times, never once stopping to pick up dirty dishes or ask us if we needed anything.  We were never offered refills on drinks, fries, root beer floats.  Waited another 14 minutes for a check, again can't find Britney. We got up from our booth to start walking out of the restaurant, and Britney suddenly appeared with our check.   Not sure where the servers go to hide, but it must be a great place to hang out while your customers wait patiently for your return."
1,"We stayed recently in a very nice suite. Beautiful decor -- especially the tile floors in the entry, bathroom & powder room. Really enjoyed the spa and pool here. Standard Marriott level of service."
1,"After living down the street from this bar for ~2 years, I finally ventured there last night and was very impressed! My friends and I took a cue from the other Yelpers and went to Stinky's during a Pens game and had a great time.  We all got wings, (because who can pass up the Pens game special of $0.40 wings?!) and there were zero complaints.  I got the \""stinkers\"" flavor, which I was informed was a garlic, hot and bbq mix.  They were delicious!!  My mouth is still salivating and I may have licked the sauce off each finger in the most un-ladylike fashion, but I couldn't let any go to waste!  Among my friends, we tried the Ranch, Hot and Cajun flavors and everyone liked what they got.  The bartenders were friendly and made sure we knew right away of the specials, like when the Pens score, you get $2 off your next beer.  Not only is this is an amazing deal, but I appreciated that the bartender informed us of this, as she probably realized it was our first time visiting.  \nAs for the atmosphere, there are a ton of TV's, which makes watching the game convenient from wherever you're seated.  The place was pretty big too - we had a table in the main area, but noticed a side room with some games and a back room with tables and pool table, maybe?  Also, (as a girl I feel the need to proclaim this in writing,) Stinky's bathrooms were about the nicest/cleanest I've ever seen in a bar!  The only small complaint is that it was a bit smoky, but I've learned to deal, and almost expect this, at most bars so it wasn't a deal breaker for me, at least.  \nIf you're looking for a laid-back, no-frills type of bar to relax with your friends, I absolutely recommend this bar.  Off the beaten path of Butler Street, it's like a little hidden gem in Lawrenceville.  My friends and I can't wait to go back!"
1,"3/11/08 UPDATE:\nSakana is great for take-out, too. Generous portions of nigiri sushi are sure to delight just about anyone. While they may not offer alot of selection when it comes to rolls, what they do serve up is mighty tasty and sure to satiate even the most hungry of sushi lovers. \n\n* * *\n\nForget that it's in a strip mall or lacks decor. Just go. Sakana is one of the best places in the Valley to enjoy sushi. They have unique rolls that'll pique your interest, and perhaps encourage an eye brow raise. If colorful rolls aren't your thing, then go with the sashima - the pieces are so generous, you'll feel like you robbed the place."
0,I recommend this place to no one! It was a horrible experience. Everyone was extremely rude and they are very expensive...
0,"Who still buys books anymore?\nAnd who in their right mind wants to read one in Las Vegas when you can be doing so much more?\n\n*lowly raising hand*\n\nI like books and have delusions of finding rare literature at some random bookstore.\nAnywho, we were at Trader Joe's when I noticed this place, and since I wanted something to read, I thought I'd give this place a chance.\n\nWe were greeted by a nice couple who directed us to the fiction section.\nThe place reminded more of my library in grade school than it did a bookstore. \nNo luck on finding any interesting fiction to read and no rare books, but I did find plenty of Danielle Steele novels.\nAren't I lucky?\n\nOverall, I think I'll just visit the library out here."
0,"I ate here because reviews were pretty good and I LOVE Chinese food.This place is awful. I noticed the waterchest nuts had mold, after eating half the plate. Then got food poisoning. Hooray! Will never eat here again. Gross!! Worst place I have ever eaten and that says a lot."
1,"This place was good, I will have to go back and try more menu items.  I kept it simple and got the bbq pork and chicken wrap with loaded mash and sweet tea.  Everything was good I think the wrap could have used more sauce however I did add bbq myself and that was good as well.  The sweet tea was good and the loaded mash was pretty good even with a little bbq sauce on it.  I want to try the ribs and more will definitely come back.  More of a quick eat or take out kind of place."
0,"We have been here twice now.  We were told about it from a friend and we are all about trying new places.  Ok, Food good - thank you for organic and fresh squeezed OJ.  \n\nHowever, your staff lacks personality and they seem to be  \""deer in the head lights\"". There is a difference between a Server and an Order taker. So, far both times we've had Order takers.  \""Hi, are you ready?\""  Opposed to:  Hello, how are you guys?  Have you been here before?  Let me tell you about our daily specials and let me recommend a few of my favorites. Nope, we got, are you ready? -- both times.  Going to the counter to pay, again no personality, lifeless humans standing there doing a job.  \n\nManager(s), you may want to wander around and do table checks. I can tell you want this place to do well, but, with your LIFELESS staff, it's going to be a stretch to be successful.  I mean --  jeez, even at Denny's we get some personality.  \n\nThere is no personality here -- zombies, taking orders and doing a \""job.\""  Just because your organic, doesn't mean you need have lifeless attitudes. \n\nSay hi, be fun, enjoy your customers, look people in the eye, check up on tables regularly, and when its time for your NEW Clients to pay their bills --  this is when you should be asking your NEW clientele, \""How was your experience?\"" \n\nWe will try your restaurant one more time, but if it's the same next time - No more repeat visits for us.  For those who know good service -- it won't take long for  people to spread the word.  So,  Are you amazing or below average?  You choose. \n\nRight now, Your below average. \n\nI hope you'll take this review and \""Step it up!\""  Its very fixable right now.  \n\nSee you next time......I pray you can \""step it up\"" and bring some personality to your service staff. Right now, it's stale."
1,"Went to Vegas for my buddy's bachelor party and did a visit to Guns & Ammo Garage. They have a shuttle to pick to you up so that is a plus already.We all got some type of package (give or take $150 each) and were able to shoot four different types of guns. I got the Zombie Package (Uzi, Glock, AK 47 and Pump action shotgun) and  although I was a little nervous at first, the instructors are really helpful and makes sure you are ready. Overall it was a fun time."
0,This place I dont recommend My daughter quince was ruined by this Shop. They are unprofessional and double booking had my daughter late to church ceremony the girls court never made it to the ceremony at all. We where booked at 7am to 9am the church started at 11am I WILL NOT RECOMMEND THIS PLACE. \n\nDO NOT GO HERE WARNING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1,"Fresh and tasty sandwiches just like any other Port of Subs location. When I went over the weekend, however, this one was a little slow because only 2 people were working, but there wasn't a crowd of customers either so it wasn't too bad. Still got my food in a reasonable amount of time"
1,"Bought a groupon deal when going Vegas with my mom and husband. The chopper you gonna ride is not a big one, not something you saw in the movie but good enough for us to see. I sat in passenger seat at front and the other two sit at the back, so everyone got a window seat. 20 minute ride to see the Strip and downtown. Nightview is awesome ( i booked 8pm tour, remember to checkout sunset time). The captain will not talk a lot (will only tell you where is the best time to take photo for strip, and where is downtown). When you waiting you are free to look at their airplane garages and take photos, which is a plus! During this vegas trip I also went to the top of Paris Effie tower to see Vegas from top (in the daytime), and i think helicopter is way better! BTW the groupon includes a comedy magic show ticket, and the show was awesome, mom said her stomach hurts because she laugh so hard! Fun time~"
0,"I heard great things about this bakery. Boy, was I disappointed. I got a small birthday cake and requested flowers, but when I picked it up, it looked like some the person who decorated was still tripping out from the Bonnaroo festival. Either that or the cake itself was attacked by 5 different color cans of silly string. It looked like a child decorated it. When we cut into the cake, it also looked like a kindergardener had executed the work. Three layers in a 6 inch cake? wtf? They were all different sizes and looked like they were scraps from another cake. I was ok with all of this if it tasted good. Well, that dream was shattered as I tasted my first bite. The \""buttercream\"" icing tasted like someone had an accident and mistook \""one tablespoon - almond extract\"" for \""one cup - almond extract. And since they probably used cake scraps, as mentioned above, this could explain why it was so D - R - Y, dry. I was ~very~ bummed because I had ~very~ high hopes for this bakery. The people were nice to me, though."

1,"What??  I haven't written a review for Bachi yet either?\n\nTheir bread makes the burger. Of course, their meats are top notch, and the toppings are creative.  But the bread.  Oh, it's perfect!\n\nThe oxtail chili fries... Must get.  \n\nAnd, their green ice tea has free refills.  And it's tasty.  Writing this makes me want to go back to Vegas!"
1,"When Taj Mahal closed/was sold my boyfriend and I were sorely disappointed that we lost our favorite Indian restaurant and lunch buffet. By chance we went here tonight and finally after a couple of months we can say we've found a new favorite! We are snobs when it comes to good Indian food and we were giving up on finding another good place to go to.\n\nI am a korma girl and it was so tasty, their mild is pretty mild so if you can handle some spice go to medium, and my boyfriend's masala was surprisingly better then Taj Mahal's. A feat we though was impossible. The garlic naan was cooked/baked to perfection--- at other places we've tried its been burned or awkwardly gummy.\n\nEven though we just had dinner there tonight we decided we're going back tomorrow for lunch to check out the $8.95 lunch buffet!"
0,"Famous Dave's is so much better!! I use to go here all the time when i was growing up and i loved it, i don't know what happened but there food really went down the drain... the ribs are dry and black on the bottom and the fries have way too much seasoning. I think Jon needs to get back in the kitchen instead of spending all his time at the bar next door."
1,Entered the store to really friendly helpful staff...The store is packed full of fun things to buy. You are able to buy the Tonto pass at this location. I need to go back just to be able to look at everything.
1,This restaurant had delicious food at reasonable prices. You can bring your own wine and enjoy their many appetizers while sitting in the terraced area. Great neighbourhood family restaurant.
1,Lets just say this place is awesome! My sister in law ordered that huge ol' hot dog and shared it with 3 different people. I had a bbq chicken salad and it was pretty good and a very decent size. I wanted to take the cup home that they served our drinks it!  It is a fun place to work out and if your kids are scared of dark make up I would definitely steer clear of this place!!! But fun place to just enjoy a good lunch/drink or two!
0,"like everyone else has said. this place is horrible. I think this is the place in the desert where records go to die, cus at these prices no ones ever gonna buy em again. Unless theyre suckers. I had heard that nothing had price tags on em and that it was for true record collectors so i went in knowing Id have to spend a lil xtra to get what I wanted but the prices are way out there. I picked up 3 45's for him to price me. I thought he'd look em up in a price guide or on an online auction site and ball park it. No. He looked at one and told me $100. I knew it was kinda hard to find so i was like eh maybe the other two he said he'd have to listen to em to price em but prolly $50-75. I wanted to gage his pricing so I found a LP i have at home I got for $12-15 \""Get Ready Rocksteady\"" he had his son go online and look it up then tells me $250. I asked him how many were on the site. maybe he was lookin on Ebay. I was hoping there was 3 and you split the difference he told me just one. i still dont know where he got the price. When I first walked in he was very rude not nicely asking what I wanted and seemed like he didnt want any business trying to scare me off with \""these records are pretty pricy\"" he told me nothing less than $15 but i didnt think he'd want $500+ for 3 45's and one LP. dont waste your time with this guy and his horrible shop"
0,Don't really know where to begin. I guess I'll start by saying the service is ridiculously slow! It took forever for me to get a burger and drink. Even standing in the line waiting it took forever for me to get my food ordered. When it was finally my turn the cashier just walks away leaving me waiting there. Then after a few minutes she decides to grace me with her presence and just take my order! How sweet of her right? Anyways I order and I wait another 10 minutes for my food. Well it must have sat there because the burger was cold and it tasted like crap to boot. Then about an hour later I felt a nasty rumbling in my stomach and had to book it to the bathroom. That was the first thing I had eaten that day so there was nothing else that could have caused that. For the burger and drink it set me back $13.00. I am sure that for some it is a good place to get a quick cheaper bite to eat in Vegas but for me it's not.
0,"Taken my daughter to this office a few times, but won't anymore. The good points- the office is clean. The staff that answers the phone is nice and usually helpful.  The hygienists are all really nice and are kid friendly.  On the downside- when you walk into this place it just feels cold.  The staff won't even greet you since you have to sign in at a computer.  Dr. Ash wasn't as kid-friendly and a little bullish with my daughter.  I understand she was crying, but she didn't do anything to make her feel more comfortable.  They seem to be all about money; they are very aggressive about making future appointments and overcharging when they can.  I would not recommend anyone to this place."
0,"The wait was NOT worth the wait.\n\nHonestly, I don't know what was the hold up with the line.  As I was waiting with my group, I looked up on Yelp and when I saw people saying they were waiting in line for over an hour, I judged the length of my line and thought maybe 20 minutes tops.  Boy, was I wrong.  They were seating a party about every 3 minutes.  I'll give them the benefit and say that it was probably due to their limited seating, and hope that it is not simply the staff's inefficiency. \n\nThe offerings at the buffet itself were not very 'French' as per the assumed theme this buffet was projecting.  Most of the spoon handles had been in use for too long (and looked like they were given to a teething infant for a few hours and felt just as sticky as you can imagine).   The food that those instruments dished up was bland, and not very appealing.\n\nI will say our server kept on top of our drinks (non-alcoholic), but missed the plates.  The whole staff just seemed over-loaded by the crowds and like they had never experienced such an amount of patrons in their restaurant at a time.  Really confused as to what this was all about since our server mentioned to us that this happens all the time.  Well, then prepare for it a little more!\n\nAs stated previously, totally not worth your wait in line.  While you're waiting there, look over the reviews of the Bellagio buffet, and if you can cough up a few dollars more, ditch this line and head across the street.  You'll be glad you did, trust me."
1,Chloe shaped my eyebrows perfectly and made me feel very comfortable and relaxed. Overall it was a very pleasant experience and I'll definitely be back. Would recommend to everyone! Try it out. You won't be disappointed.
1,"My husband and I wanted a nice dinner while in Vegas and found Gallagher's thru Yelp. It was close to our hotel and not terribly overpriced, so we decided that would be the spot.\n\nWe are SO glad we chose this place. For appetizer, we had the calamari. SO good. For dinner, I had the Queen cut Prime Rib (medium) and my husband had the Ribeye (medium rare). Both were huge, cooked perfectly and tasted AMAZING. As sides we had the macaroni & cheese and asparagus. Seriously, the macaroni & cheese is to die for. The hickory bacon in it makes it just amazing. We had so many leftovers that we took a doggy bag back to our hotel for a friend. It was about $100 for both of us, which wasn't too bad at all, and worth every penny.\n\nThe *only* complaint is that they sort of shoved us in a corner table (not sure if the fact that we are an obviously pierced/tattooed couple had anything to do with it), but a better table would have been nice. However, our waiter Phillip was very nice & seemed non-judgmental, so we didn't mind too much."
1,"We decided to try this place out after shopping at Costco.  The staff was friendly enough.  I got beef and pork tacos and the husband ordered a chicken quesadilla.  The food is very good for fast food.  I just wish that they had some mild sauces because not everyone likes hot sauce and burn your ass sauce.  Also, the counter is too high.  Little people like me can't see what's going on with our food! :)"
1,"I am giving this four star rating for one reason, the bartender named Matt. If that is not his name I will correct it when I go back. And I will. My issues are: very little seating in \""cool bar area\"", and the fact that people, who I think were owners, kept setting things on the counter where I was sitting. Some lady was yelling on the phone next to us in the dining area (sigh) for most of our stay. My food was forgotten in the kitchen, we got wings. They are made with siriachi and actually were very good for being barely warm. We got a bacon blue cheese dressing with them that was excellent. Worth coming back for was watching one amazing man make like a million drinks at full speed with no flaws. And he tastes them all, the sanitary way (don't worry) so that you will be sure o get a great drink. He helped us pick beers that we liked, and he was spot on. I would go every night to watch him. Seriously. Give that man a raise!!!"
1,"OMG one of the best burgers and milk shakes I've ever had.\n\nThe order:\nBLT Burger - 7oz . Grilled Certified Angus Beef, Double Smoked Bacon, Lettuce & Tomato.  \nAnd a big helping of Skinny Fries (yummy)!\n\nMilkshake (Nut Job) - Vanilla Ice Cream, Nutella, Slivered Almonds: \nThe shake was so thick I had to let it sit for a few minutes.  It's a pretty good size so I split half with my friend."
0,"I guess they train their counter staff to not listen to the customer's order.  This has happened to me in the past, as you can see by my previous reviews of this location.\n\nYou try and put in your order, and the cashier is rude and interrupts.  Constantly.  The resulted in an incorrect order on three points, of which I only knew to correct two.  My wife had ordered her sandwich without onions, and the cashier screwed it up.  \n\nI would be one thing if they just got the order wrong, but the cashier actively interrupting the customer causes errors and confusion and I didn't appreciate the attitude of the cashier when I had to correct our order.  There are many good burger options around this store, and we will be taking our business elsewhere."
1,"I bought my dog a birthday cake from here. I called on a sat and wanted to pick it up on Sunday, that was fine with them! Every other place I called said I needed to wait a couple days. Anyway the cake was super cute in the shape of a dog bone, pink and white cream cheese frosting, it was peanut butter cake ! And little confetti pieces all over. They also have very adorable dog clothing and accessories."
0,"It's a Friday, at midnight. The Vig Uptown has 4 stars on Yelp.....HOW COME THERE'S NO ONE HERE??? Where is everyone? Why is it so quiet? I was very confused- it looks like a place where there should be a ton of people. But no, empty. Sad."
0,"Had a tuna sandwich, which was OK, and a cup of flat coffee that I didn't finish.  This was $9.50... a bit steep. \n\nThe layout is awful... the kitchen bisects the seating area, and all of the kitchen noise is audible (read: deafening) in the seating areas.  \n\nI asked for milk in coffee and was told the half and half was behind me.  Half and Half is the farthest thing from milk in the universe. \n\nWon't be back."
0,I practically survuved on KFC in high school but over the last 20 yrs it has just lost its allure.\n\n\nI still like the coleslaw & biscuits but the chicken just isnt up to snuff anymore. Last time I visited I tried the new Chipotle flavored and it was just awful. The stuff is soooo greasy I can never eat more than 1 pc and I'm a guy who can put away some food.\n\nI still risk it every time I get a coupon in the mail...I guess I'm always hoping it will be good again.
1,"Accidentally showed up during happy hour and that was great!  \n\nThey have little tapas dishes for under $2.00.  Perfect little appetizer before having one of their yummy gyros! I always have to order extra tzatziki,not because there isn't enough on the gyro, but because it's pretty damn tasty! \n\nMy friend had their Chicken Pasta Salad and as usual, it was delicious.\n\nI was sad to see that they didn't have their tomato basil soup this time.  I dream about this soup. I crave it. There is just something about this soup that makes you feel all fuzzy and warm inside!  I will order this soup even if it is 115 degrees outside! The kicker...their fresh pita chips that are served with this soup! \n\nYummy!"
1,"If I could, I would give this place 4.5 stars. Allow me to explain....\n\nWe started my birthday dinner off with the tuna tartare and the calamari..  both were excellent apps.. one of my cousins had the Svedka vodka infused pineapple cocktail (the VIP... get it?!?) which I had a sip from and enjoyed a lot.\n\nOur sides for the dinner were the asparagus, potatoes au gratin, and the lobster mac and cheese.  All were good but the lobster mac and cheese stood out.. mostly b/c I love me some mac and cheese.\n\nFor dinner I ordered the 16 oz prime ribeye cooked medium. As per our server's recommendation, I cut into it to determine if the doneness was correct... I did and it was cooked perfectly, or so I tthought. As I started to cut off a piece for my tablemates to try the steak, it turned out to be a step below rare. \n\nI advised our server about the doneness of my steak and he apologized and he sent it back.  A few minutes later, another gentleman in a suit came up to me and apologized about the doneness of my steak.  When it came back, MY OH MY, best steak I've had all year.\n\nThe service throughout dinner was solid. Waters were promptly refilled.  When my beer was close to being empty I was asked if I wanted another. \n\nAs a postscript to my review, towards the end of the dinner, I filled out one of their mailing cards just for the hell of it. This week, I recived a hand written thank you card from our server thanking me and my party for having my birthday dinnner there.  That blew my mind away.\n\nSo, 4.5 stars out of 5. It would have been 5 but the 1/2 star deduction was because I had to send my steak back. But everything else was perfect.  Better than the other steakhouse I went to in Vegas earlier in the year."
0,"Visited the newest Jimmy John's in our area on Sunday afternoon. The place still has that \""new store feel\"" it's so squeaky clean, but what made it really seem like a brand new Jimmy John's was the lack of experience from the people behind the counter.\n\nMy husband ordered a #9 and asked for hot peppers as well. This completely flummoxed the young woman working the register, but after a couple of confused looks one of the guys making a sandwich said something to her and she put the order in.\n\nNext up, I ordered a #2, also with hot peppers. She repeated my order back to me, even as she got it wrong on the register.\n\nMy husband received his sandwich with maybe 3 hot peppers on it. My sandwich had none, and the receipt showed she didn't include it when she rang us up.\n\nEverything about the people working there just screams \""NEW!!!!\"" right now. I had to ask her to give me a cup for the drink I ordered after she just turned away from us to help the next customer. The wait for our sandwiches wasn't long but it was comical watching the guy behind the counter reposition each of our sandwiches several times, moving it by millimeters precisely before wrapping it.\n\nThis was the worst experience we've had at Jimmy John's. I've never had them get my order wrong before. It wasn't a TERRIBLE experience in the grand scheme of things, but it's definitely below the standards I've seen in their Pineville store. I'll give this new location another chance, but not for another month or two so the staff gets a chance to learn how to ring up orders correctly."
1,"First time here, love the vibe. Got a seat outside on the patio. Had great service from Melinda. She hooked it up w a tasty pancake while we waited for our food. My harvest Benny ended up not being my fav which wasn't a big deal to me but the management ended up giving me a discount. I dig this place. Everyone that works here seems happy which feeds the over all positive welcome vibe."
1,"My friend and I came to this restaurant after a really grueling Saturday swim endurance practice, and it turned out to be a good choice. The staff was friendly and attentive, our appetizer (sun-dried tomato hummus) and entrees (gyro dinner, pastichio) arrived fast, which we appreciated because we were really hungry. The food was good and the portions generous. Although I would have appreciated brighter lighting, the dimly lit evening atmosphere did make for a more relaxing experience."
1,"If you are considering to try their: \nchicken skin, lechong kawali, tosilog, bbq pork, bangusilog and bicol express, yes try them -- they're all *good.\n\nThe bangus was a bit smaller than i expected, the lechong kawali and chicken skin could be a little crispier.\n\nIf you like bicol express i think you're gonna love their bicol express! Out of all that i have tried their bicol express was impressive!\n\nAlmost all of the groups who were there at the same time we were there ordered bulalo so i'm assuming their bulalo is good. We're gonna try that next time we crave for Filipino food.\n\nHaving said all these if their prices were a little higher and their servings a little smaller i probably would think twice about giving them 4 stars."
0,"We have dined a this Bonefish location three times since it opened.  We like their menu items and that they are and Outback owned company so we didn't want our first impression of the staff to deter us from coming back.  We have been back 2 times since and have been very displeased with the service staff each time.  They are slow, incompetent, and inattentive.  The only reason they got 2 stars instead of 1 is because their Bang Bang Shrimp has been excellent every time."
0,"35 minutes. That's how long my four-year-old son and I waited from the time we sat down until we received our lunch. Granted, my son is more patient than most children his age, but after about 20 minutes, he started to ask about where his food was. This occurred on Good Friday between 1:30 and 2:30 pm.\n\nI guess I should have been alerted to this situation from the moment I walked in. No one greeted us, and it took about three minutes before we were even acknowledged. We wanted to sit outside, but after 60 seconds of debating with a colleague, the gentleman told us there were no outside seats - although we clearly saw two empty tables. Then, the shirts on the employees said, \""Unique like a Brooklyn accent.\"" I really should question a company that doesn't use proper grammar. (It should read, \""Unique, like a Brooklyn accent.\"")\n\nThe person who seated us also took our order moments after we sat down. I asked for apple juice for my son and was told they were out, so we switched to iced tea for him and water with lemon for me. We shortly received our drinks - sans lemon. \n\nAfter we were there about 10 minutes, a large party of 10 was seated near us. Half were small children my son's age and they received lemons with their beverages, so my thought that the restaurant was perhaps out of those too was erased. Unfortunately, our waiter never checked on us, and I actually had to flag him down as my son was whining for food to get a water refill and ask - again - for a lemon. It was then that he told me he'd check on our food.\n\nFINALLY, 35 minutes in, our food arrived. I think we were so hungry at that point that dirt would have sufficed. My son doesn't usually like mac and cheese that is penne with cheese sauce, but he ate nearly all of it. My eggplant lasagna was certainly not the best I've had. Neither of our items was baked, so I'm still not sure what the holdup was. And, by the way, the table of 10 received their food before we did and came and left in the hour we were there. While I'm complaining, my son's ice cream was so frozen I almost needed a knife to cut it for him.\n\nI would like to say the poor service was because the restaurant was understaffed. Although the place was full, I counted seven employees, including a manager. Other tables were receiving much better service, so I'd have to say the problem was more with our server (who never shared his name). My son and I eat out about once a week, and I always leave 20% for a tip, but this time I left $1 on a $16 bill. At first, I felt badly about it, but then I remembered, \""Oh yeah, it's not like I'm ever coming back here.\""\n\n*** On 4/5/10, Alana, a representative from NYPD Pizza sent me an e-mail when she came across my review and offered her sincere apologies, a follow-up call from customer service, and a coupon for a free pizza / meal. I was very appreciative of the response, and as I told her, I've been to other NYPD Pizza locations with much better results; I think this episode was the result of a new or poorly trained server."
0,Worst service ever had a waitress named Nikki and we asked for separate checks and first she said was don't you guys have cash?? Couldn't believe it then she gave our drinks and one of the drinks tasted like tequila and soda and we asked politely to redo the drink and her response was we don't like to waste alcohol so what would you like fixed. Again shocked so we went to  bartender to fix drink. Then bill came we work in the industry and drinks half off she charged us full price!!!! When she even stated in the begin about us having bracelets bcuz we work in the industry. She changed it and added us a 18 percent grat to it. Worst experience ever and horrible server EVER!!!!!!

0,"There's a reason why this Pho place closes early compared to most places. Simply put, like your dad or mom have probably have said about your exs, you could do so much better.\n\nI went here with my fiancee just for a quick lunch. I had the pho tai and she had bun cha. (Bun cha is rice vermicelli with fried spring rolls usually accompanied by seasoned fish sauce in case you are wondering.) Now going to Jenni Pho, Pho being the namesake of the restaurant, you think you would get something that is standard or above par. Not so much. Like opening a can of peanuts and getting snakes instead, I was quickly disappointed and surprised at how disappointing it was. The broth was weak and I felt I could have done better with a packet of ramen. The noodles were alright and the beef was eh. My fiancee's dish didn't far any better. Her vermicelli was cold. Not cold as in it was hot in the window and probably got cold after waiting for a little bit. No. It was cold as in grabbing it from a lowboy cold. The spring rolls were also mediocre at best. Service was not bad and seemed apologetic for the most part. The floors were a little messy and the restaurant having not been busy when we were there, I can only say probably due to laziness. \n\nCompeting against other established Pho institutions in Chinatown is rough but at least bring your full game. Just felt like this place needs a lot of improvements in the kitchen work for this place to be at least somewhat approachable again."
1,"If you are staying at the Venetian/Palazzo supercenter and need a good lunch option, head down to the mall and check this place out.  Tons of TVs, beer on tap, and a back burger that not only has bacon IN the burger, but also on top with some smoked gouda.  Granted I was drunker than Dean Martin by noon (my noon, Dean's 9AM) and starving, but this was one of the better burgers I had.  Sat with 8 other guys and they all seemed happy as well."
1,"Oh my goodness, I love this coffee place.  I had it for the first time last week, and I wake up craving it every day now.  The white mocha was what I got (iced) and it was so good! Way better than Starbucks! I am excited to try the other drinks on the menu, it is a good thing they are far from where I live, otherwise I would be drinking it everday."
0,"Reluctantly!!! We just ordered pizza and chicken wings from Rosati's, Tempe. The last pizza was HORRIBLE!!! We thought we'd give 1 last try because we had some box tops for half off? We noticed we had a missed call from Rosati's? We thought it was to confirm our order. But it was a rude guy claiming his name was Scott claiming he was the owner and how did we collect 10 box tops?  We told him, \""by buying pizza?\"" He was rude and sounded like a drunk from the hood? Maybe this guy is having money problems or something? Do yourself a favor and AVOID SCOTT and all locations of Rosati's Pizza as this Scott guy was very unprofessional and If he is the owner we suggest he spend his time at AA, trying to make pizza,  and trying to get his customer service up to par from a ZERO! If we could give Rosati's a ZERO STAR we would!"
1,"I was in LV visiting from Vancouver Canada. They came HIGHLY recommended from a staff member from the vape shop I visit back home. These guys were awesome. Joey hooked me up and let me take my time trying out some mods. I left with a BEAUTIFUL Penny mod (hits like a train). Can't say enough about how great Joey was. He really knows his stuff and their house juices are incredible. \n\nI will be making this my go-to stop for everything vaping related when I'm in town. If you live in Vegas you should make this your spot. Visiting from out of town? This place is a one stop shop. Awesome selection of high end mods and fantastic selection of drip tips, juices and accessories. \n\nThank you!!!!"
0,"I purchased the Travelzoo knowing darn well that tax and gratuity weren't included. WHAT I DID NOT EXPECT WAS A 20% TAX TO BE ADDED ON THE VALUE OF MY MEAL AUTOMATICALLY. Not knowing this I tipped another 20 bucks. No where on my voucher, menu, restaurant, website, waiter telling us did it clearly state that a 20% gratuity would be added ON ALL PURCHASES. Not only that it was based on the value of the meal which is arbitrary at best. I now noticed travelzoo has $410 dollar value voucher for $99 for almost the exact same thing.....well except instead of a $62 dollar tip on a $99 dollar meal they will get an $82 dollar tip on a $99 dollar meal. Food was sub par at best. My gf and I didn't even finish it all or want to take it home. BEWARE of this place. If you want somewhere nice in the Palms try ALIZE they are 10x better and a whole heck of a lot cheaper which is sad because they were a lot fancier than this place."
0,"Just stayed here for PPAI show. Not impressed. Although the room was pretty clean, it smelled like cat piss when I opened the door. Shower didn't drain, when my husband got out of the shower the first night, there was a was if long nasty wet hair laying in the shower after it drained. EWE.\nSo I picked it up and went on with my day. \nWhen I finally decided to call about the shower filling up like a tub, they did come up and fix it by the time I got back to the room. \nValet was quick and helpful.\nThere is also a 'resort fee' that is stupid. And the elevator was awfully rickety and the buffet literally was disgusting and I'm not a picky eater. Luckily I didn't witness any cockroaches.\nMuch better options on the strip to stay. I probably won't be coming here again but we did win close to $800 on a slot machine here :)"
0,"I came here for restaurant week and I've never had such a terrible dining experience before. The food and service here deserves 0 stars, however, the restaurant's decor is elegant.\n\nI ordered a blackberry salad for my appetizer and it was awful. The salad consisted of a few pieces of raw and undressed spinach, four blackberries, and sloppy hand shredded ham. \n\nMy stuffed sole over pasta was disappointing. You can't call yourselves an italian restaurant when you overcook your pasta to the point of no return. There was no seasoning at all on the food (which would explain the salt and pepper shakers on the table). The fish was overcooked.\n\nMy boyfriend ordered a steak with stuffed shrimp. They gave him two mere pieces of shrimp and the supposed \""crabmeat\"" stuffing was mainly breading. The funniest part was the sauce they decided to put on the plate. They served the steak with a huge portion of sauce in a little dish which tasted like mustard straight from the squeeze bottle. Why is that supposed to be there again? Had one poured that all over the steak, one's palate would be drowned in horseradish. \n\nDessert was mediocre. My almond cake tasted like a defrosted pound cake with reddiwhip on the side. \n\nYou've been warned. Olive Garden may be a better pick."
1,"I wanted a tattoo of my dog Zoey. I did my research on local artists and decided on Eddie. My research time really paid off because the work Eddie did is nothing short of awesome! The detail is incredible, right down to her whiskers.The coloring is spot on. He even captured her intangible qualities: personality, heart and soul. To say I'm pleased is a complete understatement. The whole experience was great.\nI would not hesitate to get another tattoo from Eddie or to highly recommend him. \nThank you Eddie, Jane"
1,"This was a restaurant.com visit, around 2pm on a weekday.\nWe were the only patrons, until 1 other person showed up for the buffet. We took one look at the buffet and thought it had seen better days. And there were only 2 vegetarian options so we ordered from the menu.\nPakistani food is different from Indian food, but not by much according to the menu options. I like to order things I've never had before, so honestly, I can't really remember it. But it did have spinach, eggplant, and potatoes in a spicy sauce. It was fine.\nAlso ordered a side of naan and it was the tastiest I've ever eaten.\n\nAll in all, a good meal. Price point is good for middle class budgets."
0,Greasy and quick should be the name of this place.. I ordered the Mongolian beef and it was drenched in oil.. it was disgusting.
1,"Great experience! Ample amount of food, the tomato soup was AMAZING, chicken was slightly dry, potatoes were great, and so was dessert. Drinks were perfect sizes and the show was the perfect amount of time."
0,"I would have rather eaten at Panda Express. My food was some of the most bland, uninspired food I have eaten in a long time. My won ton soup was too salty for my liking and the sushi was falling apart. I wasn't all that impressed with my fella's barbecue combination dish, but it was better than mine. And, being that the restaurant is in a casino, everything was of course overpriced. The service was the only thing that saved this place from getting one star. \n\nSave your money and find some cheap hole in the wall Chinese restaurant off the strip."
1,"Clean hotel, fast service, very friendly staff. Friends and I stayed here for EDC. It is very close to the Speedway and there is a complimentary breakfast in the morning. :) Compared to all the other hotels I saw in the area, it looked like a 5 star hotel. Also, it isn't pricey and the room I stayed in had a microwave, fridge, and a flat screen tv."
1,"Ich esse gerne Griechisch und war nach meinem letzten Besuch beim Rhodos wieder sehr zufrieden. Alles frisch gekocht, als h\u00e4tte tats\u00e4chlich eine griechische Mama gekocht. Man schmeckt und sieht den Unterschied: die Salate kommen nicht aus dem Eimer, die Pommes nicht aus der TK-Packung. Und \u00fcber dem Preis kann man nicht meckern. Die Einrichtung ist nicht jedermanns Sache, aber alles macht einen sauberen und gepflegten Eindruck. Ich w\u00fcrde das Lokal auf jedem Fall weiter empfehlen."
1,"My date and I stopped by for dinner before our evening at the Herberger.  We've heard friends compliment this establishment, so we were curious to try it.\n\nI had the blackened salmon, and my date went with the prime rib.  The fish was a tad overcooked.  However, the prime rib was the largest cut I can recall seeing.  And it wasn't mostly fat.  It was a thing of beauty.\n\nEvery bite of the salmon mocked me.  Oh why didn't I get the prime rib?  Because, the doctor recommended I restrict my intake of red meat.  But I did manage to sneak a bite, and it was so juicy and flavorful.\n\nThere was also live music on the patio.  About twelve feet behind me.  And had it not been for the Pino, the high-decibel dis-harmonies of 'Lay Down Sally' would have surely escorted me to the theater with a migraine.  And yes, I paired red with fish.\n\nGo there tonight, and order the prime rib."

1,"A lovely oasis of elegant, yet personal, table service in a mecca of fast food lunch joints and chain restaurants by Greenway Plaza.\n\nExtensive menu selection, delicate spicing, refined presentation--all served by waitstaff who clearly know their menu and are enthusiastic about it. Attentive service , yet unobtrusive--no \"" hi, I'm Patel, your new best friend \"" business--just genuine care and grace about your experience.\n\nAll dishes are served promptly (no worries, office park crowd)--in lovely crockery and china, with starched cloth napkins and substantial silverware--no sporks here--creating an atmosphere of grace and relaxation--even during a busy lunch hour. \nQuiet enough to hold a conversation without employing lipreading skills--another plus.\n\n(No typical Indian buffet scene to ensure you'll get the flu bug either.)\n\nDhaba also offers take out menu to consider for dinner when commuting home. \n\nBest basmati rice in town--all very reasonably priced."
0,Well where to start first let me say they have crazy hours are not open past 7 o'clock??so today we finally caught up with them the sushi was not good-and the service was even worse. We ordered iced tea and they didn't have any sugar and then didn't even know what sweet and low was. I think owner dug out a couple of sugar packets from her purse I swear no lie we ordered the average sushi California roll etc. etc. and we ordered the crunchy crab roll but guess what there was no crunch on we asked if it was supposed to be crunchy he said yes and walked away we also ordered a A beef teriyaki roll but they had no beef so then we said fine give us a chicken teriyaki roll apparently they had chicken but there wasn't any teriyaki on it at this point we just wanted to leave but we couldn't because their computers were down and they couldn't except debit cards they failed to tell us this before we ordered any food so I had to leave my wife there and tried to find ATM to find cash to pay the bill they should do everyone a favor and stay close more often...
1,"First impression wasn't what I expected.  Honestly, this place could have just as easily been a tattoo parlor.  It was far different than any other place I've been into.  Posters all over the walls, music playing, and the staff all tatted up, pierced, and all that jazz.  I was digging it!\n\nI recommend calling ahead, which I did.  They seemed pretty busy.  I was impressed they were cutting kids hair too, and they actually looked like they enjoyed cutting kids hair.\n\nSo I got called up, and met \""Jason\""(I put it in quotes, because when I saw his business card, it was spelled J-Sin... LOL!).  J-sin was a cool cat and fit the vibe of the place, pink hair and all.  When I started telling him what I was thinking for my hair, he was actually listening, and asking questions!  I was impressed.  He was a good conversationist, he had a few laughs, joked with the barber next to us, and just had a good time.\n\nThe cut was fantastic.  I also got a hot towel for my face while he shampooed my hair, and gave me a nice shave on the neck.\n\nOverall I was VERY impressed, and it was reasonably priced for the amount of service.  I will definitely be going back to J-sin."
0,Yelp should really enable half stars cuz this is 1.5 stars. Bellagio buffet is also rated among the top ten buffets in Vegas. Who are these people rating these ?\nVery mediocre food. No taste to anything. Really. The sushi bar is a joke. The meats are flavorless and bland. The seafood is average at best. The pizza and other Classic American fare is...yaaawn. Enough said.\nSave your money and appetite. Stay away from these overrated buffets.
1,Food & service is excellent.  This is a great place for appetizers & drinks.  Would go back when visiting Vegas.
0,I was here last weekend and I was very disappointed. The staff wasn't very friendly. And someone finally greeted me after I already looked around the whole store. \nI went in to look at their betta selection and I couldn't believe my eyes! All the bettas were in dirty water and there was even a dead one! I attached some pictures of how filthy their water was. It looked like they hadn't cleaned their cups in weeks. I was so upset I had to get outta there. \n\nDONT SELL BETTAS IF YOU ARENT GOING TO PROPERLY TAKE CARE IF THEM.
0,"This has been the most disgusting experience in my life!! We over paid $288 for two nites. Smelly carpets,bad plumbing water doesn't go down in shower or sink, the window opens  all the way no screen  anyone can fall out from fifth floor. Bt most of all my hubby and I got bitten all over from bed bugs I couldn't take the itchiness at 5 am I had to complaint and switch room at 6am. Asked for rubbing alcohol bell man said they don't carry any. At 11 am we have to  check out it 7 am and I'm still awake smh!!!! Then I find out 3 other people had same problem !! And the new room was dirty wit feces in toilet !!! Omg so disgusting and floor was full of cigarette ash and trash it was never vacuumed Wat a waste of money!!"
0,"Very average Italian food.  If you're looking for a pasta+sauce experience, it's pretty boring.  Eggplant parm was a little better than average.  But all in all, not any more exciting than what I can make for myself with a jar of sauce and box of pasta."
1,"This is one of my go-to late night food places on campus. It's cheap, the portions are huge, and its fast. There's a lot of variety to choose from on the menu. I'm a fan of the general tao's chicken and orange chicken, and the beef dishes are really good as well (but you get more meat with the chicken ones). The soups that come with the lunch/dinner specials are just ok, but the crab rangoon is very greasy and good. Overall, its good, cheap americanized chinese food."
0,"I have been robbed twice by the Saloon. \n\n Someone there likes to write in tips so if you use a credit or debit card at the Saloon make ABSOLUTELY sure that you check you bank statement the next day. After the first time I wrote it up as a mistake on my part or their but the last time I was flabbergasted.  \n\nI went in on some Yeungling special night, ordered one beer, and wrote a dollar tip.  The next morning I checked my statement and I had been charged 25.00 for that single beer.  This is not only a bad business practice but it is illegal and fraud.  But they will keep saying it was an 'accident' as long as they can get away with it.  If you do have to go here I IMPLORE you to only use cash and look at your change carefully. \n\nThis bar should be your absolute last resort in Mt Lebanon.\n\nAt closing time as well, get ready for the Mt Lebo Police Dpt to pull up outside and start hassling people who are WALKING HOME.  \n\nThere are other great bars in Mt Lebanon that are far more deserving of your money."
1,"I've hear lot of my friends talk about this taco place. I finally decide to try it. All I can say it's WOW! The food is amazing very authentic. The tacos, the burritos etc. definitely a place to come back. Hard to find  a place that has great prices with great food! The staff very friendly the food was delicious the salsas are ridiculous good! a place like this it's hard to find. The only think I don't like about this place is, it is too far away from my house :( but whenever i'm around this area I'm definitely grabbing either breakfast lunch or dinner here! Good job whoever open this place!!!"
1,Great place to eat! We have been here twice now and both times the food was exceptional!
0,I'm a regular customer at this Dunkin Donuts and they were having technology problems today but that doesn't excuse not getting the coffee the way that I ordered... smashed donuts.. no napkins and 15 minutes in the drive thru. Aaarrrggghhh.. Seriously annoyed that you made me late for an appointment... I wasted five bucks on stuff I can't eat or drink and I don't have time to stop for coffee now.  Won't be back:-(
0,Ordered the 'as pictured' flowers for an anniversary but got the value version I think. There are several fewer flowers than pictured. It's disappointing. Emailed them twice - no response. Not impressed with companies who think because you're far away (in Australia) that you won't find out.
0,"I walked in and i saw two stripper poles in the middle.\nThat alone gave me an idea of what my night would be like at JET.\n\nMe and my 4 girls got walked into the club on halloween night- we got to avoid the ridiculous line- and the entrance fee. That was definitely nice.\n\nThere was free sky vodka drinks for everyone (Not a big drinker, but my friends definitely appreciated it.)\n\nEveryone was in costume and enjoying themselves, but despite the spirit of halloween the club was just... whats the word I'm looking for... GHETTO.\n\nStripper poles, enough said.\n\nMusic wasn't flowing, a lot heavier on hip hop old and new (which isn't my thing to begin with.)\nAlso the crowd wasn't the best- I'm not elitist or anything, but what's the motivation of breaking out your best moves if there aren't any good looking people around?\n\nMe and my BFF couldn't take the Ghettoness of the place, and split- apparently that one chick Snookie from that one show was gonna be there, but since idk whotf she was, we left happily. That explained a lot about the type of crowd in the club last night- bunch of Jersey Shore wannabes.\n\nNo thanks Jet, not even for free."
0,"I think the MSG has f*#ked with my head.  Six visits.  Why?\n\nBeing Asian, I'm insulted that the Venetian would attempt to placate me with this mediocre excuse for a Chinese restaurant sandwiched between the poker tourney area, sports book, and restroom hall.\n\nKISS (Keep It Simple Stupid) review:\n\nFried rice:  extremely oily and packed with MSG.\nDim sum: nothing special except the price.  3x what you would pay in your local Chinatown.\nNoodle soups: correctly made, loaded with MSG, very little toppings, expensive.\nWok tossed noodles: should be tossed out.  Extremely oily and salty from the MSG.\n\nTo add further insult, they charge you for every day quality tea.\n\nWe all know, too much oil = restroom.  Too much MSG = lots of water = restroom.  Not a smart way for a casino to do business.  But what do I know, I'm still in my MSG coma."
0,"Just what I need, a snotty clerk who's been to the Teavana sales training course and now wants to play tea guru for the tourists.  I stopped into this particular Teavana because i had bought a cheap teapot with an interesting way to brew the tea, and I wanted to see if I could find something similar but of better quality.  I explained it to the first cleark to approach me and she had no idea what I was talking about.  She deferred to the other clerk who apparently considers herself the Mayor of Teaville.  As I started to explain what I was looking for, she cut me off and said, \""we only sell loose leaf teas and these typed of pots\"" as she motioned ot the pots on the shelves.  At that point, I had already had enough of her abrasive demeanor, so I said \""o.k., thanks,\"" and turned to leave.  As I was walking away, but still clearly in earshot, the Mayor of Teaville said rather loudly to the other clerk, \""I knew he wasn't going to buy anything.\""\nActually, I was...but won't now.  I like tea because I find it relaxing...Teavana has done an excellent job af taking away the relaxation aspect."
0,"i guess my new thing will just be writing reviews about all the shitty bouncers at bars in tempe.\n\nback on st. patrick's day i was going into casey moores and as i was locking up my bike as i watched a bouncer beat up an innocent drunk guy, who was already out of the bar and on the sidewalk trying to leave. he was pushing the guy telling him to leave but pretty much wasn't letting him leave by grabbing his shirt and throwing him around. the drunk guy kept saying \""i'm trying to leave, stop touching me!\"" the bouncer ended up throwing the guy against a car and punching him while he was on the road. then he dragged him onto the side walk and held his head by the hair and started hitting his head on the sidewalk. the bouncer was bleeding from the hand and when he noticed he started saying \""you bit me, omg i you bit me! i love putting people in jail. you're going to jail\"" once the cops showed up they wanted my story since i was a witness. me and two other people gave the police our story. once the bouncers hand was washed off his cut was clearly not a bite. probably cut it while beating the guy up. \nanyway, i went into the bar to get a drink and i was told to leave because i talked to the cops. i guess the managers really support a roided up bouncer beating up an innocent drunk guy.\nSO fast forward 3-ish months and i go back to casey moores with some friends. i was there last night and GREAT the same bouncer is surprisingly still working there. when the night ended i was outside the bar in the parking lot and the bouncer comes up to me and whispers \""if you fcking tell anyone about what happened you're not allowed back here\"" and i respond with \""what??\"" and he says it again \""you heard me. if you tell anyone about what happened you're not allowed back here. you're on a list you know\"" and then went into the bar. i hear the bouncer get crazy in the bar and start yelling and gathering staff and is talking and pointing at me. so i just stand there and wave.\n\nalso great idea to make a scene like that in front of a parking lot full of people if you don't want me telling anyone.\n\nsorry bouncer. i told the internet about how shitty you are. maybe have some respect for people and talk to people nicely.\n\ni'm not sure what else to say but i wanted to tell my story about 2/5 of my experiences of ever going there. i'm fine with not being let back in, especially if they're going to keep staff like this around.\n\nBESIDES these incidents i've had good experiences here and the other staff is awesome. nice nice people.\n\n*the bouncer who did this was a Caucasian, short stalky guy kinda chubby, short brown hair, has a scruffy beard, usually has a backward baseball cap on."
0,"So I probably go to Flat Top once a month.. not sure if that will be true anymore. \n\nSo as noted by previous users in September there was a change in format. And I am not a fan but I think it deserves some explanation because I don't think it is all bad. Also it is important to note that our server said this is not necessarily permanent- it is something they are trying out. As stated earlier Flattop claims it is for sanitation reason, and honestly I can see that. Last time I went there the sauces were a MESS and my hand was super sticky. So the new format definitely takes care of that. \n\nSo that brings us to the next important question: Does the new format skimp on overall food?? NO. The tray (instead of the bowl) the person uses actually allows for more carbs and vegetables. But there is a catch here- you just choose proteins and don't see how much protein is being put in your bow- and here they SKIMP on PROTEIN. Further more they got rid of the Filipino sausage- which I loved. And they were out of Curry Pakora that day which is my second favorite protein- so that is disappointing too. \n\nExcept the obvious lack of protein I have other problems with the new format. It requires you go linear you can't go back and get things. Also many people, myself included just don't like asking for more of something. So if your person is skimping on the food- you might not ask for more. It also requires you to make decisions faster. You have to know the sauces now. Although, my person was more than willing to let me try things and mix things up- if there are people behind you- you feel like you are slowing down the line.  Given I  like trying new sauce combos this is a problem. \n\nSo overall the experience for me is not as good as it use to be. I think I could live with it- if I was allowed to see the amount of protein being put into the bowl. But for now with the new format as it is I might not be going to flattop as often."
1,"I've dined here three times before and with each time it's always been a pleasure to have a relaxing meal with such spectacular views.\n\nThe service is perfect, they have you go through a detector before taking you up to the restaurant, and the staff is always all smiles. I recommend making a reservation before going. If there is a wait, you could chill at their lounge and they'll call you when your table is ready. Once you are about to be seated, they lead you to your table which is set on a rotating floor that slowly moves around the top of the Stratosphere. You can't really feel yourself moving once youre seated, but every so often you will see a different view of Las Vegas. Sometimes if you're lucky, you'll see people jumping off the side from Stratosphere's Skyjump attraction.\n\nThe last time I came I had decided to bring my family and my dad and ex were both wearing shirts which wasn't allowed so they had them wear a weird shade of orange, oversized dress shirt over it which was pretty funny. So unless you want to be mismatched and standing out, I suggest you suit up! Or dress somewhat nice.\n\nI've tried their Crab Cakes, Ribeye, Rack of Lamb, and Salmon which all tasted delightful to me. The horseradish addition to the Ribeye was such a wonderful combination. The juicyness of the steak blended so well with the slight pungent and distinct taste of horseradish which really made my tastebuds jump for joy. The salmon was not dry at all and was very soft and tender. I love lamb and although they are typically small portions, the sauce they put on top was extremely enjoyable. Most of all, their wide assortment of bread was one of my favorite parts of dinner. \n\nI think their pricing is somewhat agreeable and fair for the food and views you get. You're pretty much paying for the experience and views and I mean it is Vegas after all.\n\nOverall, this place is a great spot to go on a date whether it's for something special, or something casual. The food, service, and views are all on point and you will not be disappointed!"
0,I purchased a sterling silver beaded bracelet for my daughter on Christmas Eve $150\nFour months later the lobster claw failed and it is supposed to have a year warranty.  They said it failed because of wear and tear.   My daughter only wore it only on special occasions.  They wanted $86 to repair it which is over half what I  paid for the whole bracelet. I am very disappointed because of the prestige this brand is supposed to impart.  Now I feel it is just overpriced garbage.
0,"After booking a tour for the Lochs and Glens for two people, we saw nothing with this company. While it's not entirely their fault, I still would never use this company again, and I would deter everyone I knew from doing business with them. Let me explain. \n\nWe missed our Saturday tour due to an awful hotel with no phone, no wake up call, and no functioning cell phone to set an alarm. Our American phones don't work in Europe. \n\nOur scheduled time to meet was at 8 am. When I woke up at 7:50 am I panicked, and called the number provided. I was assured that we would just be able to switch on to Sundays tour instead, and I was very satisfied. They simply told me to call back at 8 pm to verify they had enough people. Of course I asked, and 6 is the amount of people they need to have a tour. \n\nI call at 8 pm, and the tour is canceled. Apparently, they only had 4 people (besides my two) who had booked the tour. So instead of counting us as the extra two, they canceled the tour. Completely leaving 6 people who wanted a tour of the Lochs high and dry. Which means stranded, I'm not sure that phrase crossed the pond. \n\nTo add insult to injury, they refuse to refund our money. Even though they had the necessary 6 people they needed. So, Timberbush kept our 140 sterling pounds, and did not show us anything. And left 4 other people to find another tour at the last minute. \n\nMiraculously, we find another tour through our awful hotel and set off to see the Lochs and Glens Sunday morning, just like Timberbush had promised, but through the eyes of another  tour group, which turned out to be fantastic."
1,Big fan of this place. The snakebite is my go-to drink! The fish & chips are fabulous. I'd definitely recommend ordering at the bar though. The bartenders are usually friendlier than the wait staff.
1,"I just got back from staying the weekend here, (25th-28th) my husband and I as well as my friends stayed in this hotel to celebrate my birthday weekend. While we checked in we were worried we would not be able to stay on the same floor as our friends (whatever rep is available next is the one that will book your room) this young man Brian from Pittsburg heard our concern and walked over to the rep that was helping my cousins, he went out of his way to find out what floor they would be in. As he came back he notified us that we would all be in the same floor. I was soo excited when I heard the news, we normally have to beg people to do this for us. And the one time I don't ask we get what we want. Brian was extremely helpful he even offered us a sky view., which I'm sure is proper procedure but he wasn't pushy about it.  Check in went very smooth, thanks!\n\nWhen we got into our rooms we were overwhelmed! The view was absolutely gorgeous, the Go Deluxe rooms are so beautiful! And the bathroom was so fun! My fav color is pink & of course there was a touch of pink in there. Call me lame but I have never seen a tv built in  mirror! Wow! This room had it all!! \n\nMy experience here was amazing, from the friendly staff including the cleaning ladies, bartenders.. Everyone was super chill & nice! I will say parking is a hassle. There are toooo many spaces for valet, and then the hotel only narrows it down for rewards customers. I was a little offended. So much empty space in valet but other customers weren't good enough to park there.  Something needs to be done about that, we parked in nearby hotels just to get to ours. If parking was not an issue I would give flamingo a 5 star. Besides that, I'm sure we will be back!!"
1,"*original review, see the updated review below*\n\nWow. What an awful experience that was.  I understand that Astor House is a small space, so they wouldn't have much in the way of staff, but our server/bartender actively avoided us for the forty-five minutes we were there after getting our drinks. I guess he didn't want us to order food...?  I was terribly unimpressed.  Three people in our party had their drink orders screwed up, other drinks were correct in theory but were terribly made.  Between the terrible service and the poorly-made drinks, I won't be returning.\n\n*updated review*\n\nI changed my mind-- I decided that I really wanted to give this place another shot.  There were a couple reasons behind this: first, I'm willing to chalk a bad experience up to being a fluke.  Everybody is allowed a spectacularly bad day.  Second, Astor House is a local joint, and I am always, always going to try and favor a local joint over another chain.  Finally, I thought that maybe we went at the wrong time, and that it would be worthwhile to give it another shot during the breakfast or lunch hours.\n\nI'm happy to say that the second experience was much better than the first.  I went for breakfast with two friends.   We sat outside, because (I'm happy to report) the place was packed.  I orded the apple boxty, the portuguese doughnuts, and orange juice.  Another friend ordered the pork and egg breakfast sandwich, and the other ordered th biscuit with nut butter and jam.  Everything was wonderfully prepared, the service was good, and the food was surprisingly inexpensive for what you got.  Call me a convert!"
0,R.I.P rum jungle techno and reggaeton?  is the play list now ? Whats the change from seven month's ago. Are the trying to get a certain clientele now also they gave us free passes to enter and we left early but was able to get re entry stamp. Another one of my favorite club's is gone or garbage now.
1,"I had not heard of this place until my sister brought it up.  We were planning a place for my birthday that my nephews and I both could enjoy and this was the perfect fit.  An adult Chuck E Cheese.  \n\nThe pizza was that of an adult entertain place as it wasn't the best however it wasn't horrible either.  You go there for the Organ and thankful you have some adults options for drinks and food.  \n\nWe all enjoyed looking at all the all the stuff going on around you and the kids liked they could be kids.  \n\nWould I go back?  Yes, I would as it is a one of a kind.  As for being hungry for a good pizza, well, you're in the valley; good pizza is hard to find period!"
0,"Tried Ruggers for the first time.  I didn't realize until we ordered that it was a smoking bar.  Fortunately no one was smoking at the time, but that will keep me from going back.  \nTwo things I don't understand: 1) The rules in Pittsburgh regarding smoking where food is served. 2) How anyone can stand to eat in a cloud of cigarette smoke.  \n\nAnyway--back to my review.  They have a pretty extensive menu, including some nice veg options.  I had the seitan steak sandwich which was pretty decent.   It came with fried pickles, which weren't as good as I was expecting. \n\nThe biggest negative for me was how long it took to get our food.  I was there on my lunch break and it was not at all crowded.  By the time our food came , my lunch hour was just about over and we had to inhale the food so that I could get back to work.  \n\nSo if you don't mind smoke and you're not in a hurry, you might enjoy Ruggers.  Personally, I won't be back."
1,"THIS PLACE IS AMAZING!\nI went in for the first time today with some very delicate items that needed to be cleaned. Everything was undamaged, perfectly cleaned and Seville is not expensive at all. Best service I have ever received!!"
1,"I am sold the flights of beer!  6 samples of craft beers in one setting will sell me every time.  Exploring craft beers can be a tricky game...we've all ordered a beer that didn't fit our palette and you have to WORK your way thru it.  I explored 3 styles of beers I'd never tried and then finished with 3 favorites to satisfy the taste buds.\n\nThere was a nice variety of food on the menu.  They have an interesting take on wings with the sauce on the side. Tried one of the salads which was tasty, but left you a little hungry...especially since it was the same price as the wings.  That moved us onto the Sweet Potato Tacos, which area little more like empanadas, but really tasty with a pesto dipping sauce.\n\nLiving in the southwest for so long I'd like to some type of hot sauce on the table or a homemade concoction to bring the heat.\n\nThe noise is a little loud, but they'll get the acoustics figured out.  The openness of the floor plan and windows will make it a great year round place for a pint.  It's smack dab in the middle of the Evans Churchill district which is great for a pub crawl"
0,"I attended this resort from 2/28/2013 through 3/6/2013.\nMy wife and I reserved a room for a work conference. My expectations were high because of the Fairmont name. The place wasn't horrible, but the service was lacking.\n\n1. The hotel nickel and dimed us. They charged us $20/night to valet our car. It would have been $10/night to park the car ourselves. Also, we only had a car for 3 of the 6 days that we stayed, and they charged us $10/day for the 3 days that we didn't even have a car, even though the front desk confirmed that we wouldn't be charged. Also, internet is about $15 per day, and an iced tea at the pool bar was $5. All the little charges were really annoying.\n\n2. The front desk person was rude. When we arrived, we found that my wife's company had put us in a room with two double beds. We asked the guy at the front desk if we could have a room with a queen or king size bed, but he refused and did not even apologize. So we both shared a double bed -- we could have stayed home and had nicer accommodations (or stayed at Hampton or a B&B)."
0,"Always have some issues with either ordering (because they can't understand me or I can't understand them) lucky to get correct order, but today was the worst ordered steak and egg burrito combo with coffee and steak an egg burrito with diet coke told me as usual would have total at window, got to window no total tried to give me a large and med soda told them it was supposed to be a large coffee didn't give me a real receipt just one with a total lady brought me bag of food said sorry having trouble with system today. Got to work opened bag had med French fry large hash brown a western bacon cheeseburger an some mystery looking burrito. Tried calling 3x keep getting fax machine doubt I'll come back to this location. Trying to give this a one star rating only because I have to but yelp has put it at 3 stars and I can't seem to fix it"
1,"This place deserves 10 stars, by far my favorite restaurant ever, absolutely love it. Every time we go to visit, this is definitely where we go for dinner, it's not cheap but well worth every penny, everything is always so fresh and delicious, and I mean everything, we always try new things along with some of our favorites and we just love this place more and more each time. The service is impeccable, the servers are very professional and very knowledgeable about the menu and drinks, if you are not sure what to get , just let them how much you are willing to spend and they will create a tasting menu for you, believe you will not be disappointed!!!! Their sea bass skewers and Peruvian corn is a must have! I mean everything is amazing there, hope everyone gets a chance to try this place!"
1,"Enjoyed the BBQ trio, and a very good selection of draft beers. I'd recommend it, and will be back next time I'm in Scottsdale."
0,This review is based on one visit.  The decorations were very unique and the staff was very friendly.  The food was not seasoned in any way and was expensive for the quantity/quality.  I had the Peppermill Burger with fries; the meat was supposed to be 1/2 lb. but seemed like 1/4 lb. and the fries had no salt.  My wife had the NY Steak and baked potato; the steak was not seasoned and the baked potato was not fully cooked.
0,I was expecting more from this restaurant. I was enjoying my husbands efforts in putting this date together. The food was slightly disappointing.  I had biscuits and sausage gravy. I received biscuits and floury tasting gravy. The sausage was M.I.A. My husband had the lobster bisque soup. The same lobster M.I.A. The staff was kind to us but very busy. I had that experience but will I go back NO! I will however visit the strip over and over it is a blast of fun. Take plenty of money with you because you will spend it.
0,"My wife and I took another couple here for Easter brunch. I am vegan, my wife is mostly vegetarian and the other couple consumes the standard American diet so we thought there would be something for everyone at The Herb Box. The dining room was somewhat noisy, not because the place was busy - it was nearly empty, but because there were employees screaming at each other in the kitchen.  This restaurant could have used some customer focused management to keep the staff in line but no matter, we won't go back. It's not a place for those following a plant-based diet because of limited choices. I had Vegetarian Sweet Potato Tacos that they simply left the cheese off of to make it vegan. That seemed to be about as far as they were willing to go to accommodate me and even at that it took two attempts because the first plate of tacos came out with meat on them. When the correct dish arrived it consisted of two small soft tacos and about 1 tablespoon of a black bean/mango salsa side. The dish was acceptable, but reminiscent of the sort of stuff that I throw together at home when I haven't planned ahead. I guess the experience seemed corporate to me. It's as if the menu was planned and executed by an accountant rather than a chef with any degree of passion. Assuming the Easter tantrum in the kitchen was an unusual event it might be worth a visit for those seeking a standard American breakfast. But you better go soon, I doubt it will be around long because there are too many good options in north Scottsdale."
0,"This needs to be posted on every APS Yelp page until they consolidate all of them. \n\nAPS is absolutely deplorable. They have a complete monopoly on Phoenix.  Consumers don't have a choice for power service provider and because APS knows this, they charge like old mob racket. I have had service with them, again, no choice, and one day I get a letter stating that I have a security deposit required. I had service at this new address for 5 months before this came to so I called. They told me because I was past the due date that they can at their discretion ask for one. EVEN AFTER SERVICE HAS BEEN CONNECTED.  I obviously have no choice in the matter. I asked them what past due meant. They told me after 13 days!!! My mortgage allows 30 days. The credit bureau reporting system is based on 30 days. The whole world works off 30 days. Past due after 15. Very crafty how the bill is due JUST before most people would pay their bills from their paycheck on the 15th. \n\nThey charge me 1.5 times my bill for the last 12 months. Now remember, I have only been there for 5 months so rather than judge it on MY last bills which are low, I have to be averaged off of another family. So the deposit was massive. \nSo I tell them (based on principal) that I cannot afford to pay it. So they say they will separate it into 2 payments (how generous). So I make the first payment of 80. Mind you, this is NOT for services rendered. \nNext month I get my bill in the mail, and like every month, I pay it.  \n\nFew days later my power gets shut off.  I think its a building fuse or from a storm, but as I am walking to the maint office, I see the yellow tag on my meter. \n\nSo I call APS and say WTF?? They tell me I was shut off for non payment. I quickly log on to my bank and see it was paid and I tell them this. They say, \"" no, it was for security deposit\"". I asked them what do I owe on my service. They said nothing. I said, so I got disconnected over an arbitrary deposit when my bill is paid in full? They said yes. \n\nThey then tell me there is a reconnection fee and if I want it done that day there is 100 rush fee.  Now, this is all happening in the morning. I went to the gym and came home within the hour. So you know the service guy was within a mile. \n\nI talked to the \""manager\"" and he was \"" nice enough to cut me a break\"" and not charge a reconnection fee. So I waited until the next day so I wouldn't have to pay the rush fee, and avoid reconnection. So because it was a cool 115 that day, I had to sleep at my gf's, WITH MY 2 KIDS!!!!\n\nThe next day all of my food was bad and still cost me over 100 for no reason.  \n\nAPS needs to be stopped and there needs to be regulation. \n\nRyan."
0,"The weekend service at this DD location is absolutely AWFUL. On several occasions, during peak morning hours, I have waited in line with dozens of other customers while one very slow employee works at the counter and several others (including management) do nothing to help. The employees I have encountered on the weekends have no customer service skills either. No friendly greeting, very inattentive, no smile, no 'thank you' when you get your order. They look miserable and dress sloppily. And God forbid you ask for an item that is not in the racks behind them. I'm glad they don't have the nerve to put a tip jar out on the counter. It would be empty!!\n\nIn fairness to this store, there is one young lady who works mid-day during the week who is absolutely wonderful. (I wish I knew her name.) She is everything the weekend crew is not, and she should teach them a bit about customer service.\n\nIt is amazing how DD on the east coast is run so differently. You never wait in line more than 5 minutes, they greet you by name and know how you like your coffee. 'Light and sweet' is a legitimate request, and you always find the variety of product you go in for."
0,"I don't think I've ever been so disappointed in my life. So disappointed, in fact, that I created a yelp account just to warn the world. I brought a friend with celiac here, despite the bad reviews, because celiac. Turns out the only \""gluten-free kitchen\"" in Pittsburgh is a farce. They've changed their menu and are NO LONGER CELIAC-FRIENDLY! If you have a low intolerance and are willing to put your health in someone else's hands, go for it. I myself, would not trust a kitchen to have \""little to no cross-contamination\"" in the service industry, I've worked it for too long. We didn't eat here, obviously, but the place would have gotten a one star review solely for the awful loud club music and the freezing temperatures (it wasn't even that cold out the day we were there).\nThe decor is really odd as well...wobbly tables, concrete floors, exposed server station, somewhat disturbing (yet right up my personal alley) paintings for sale, a large black and white mural that is questionably finished, and weird yellow flowers on the front of the scratched up bar. Looks like it was definitely thrown together at the last minute or for the smallest expense possible, maybe both? There's really no identity to the place and the staff seems totally unprepared, but in the we-aren't-given-the-tools-so-we-give-up sort of way. Defeated, more than unprepared.\nAnd the attitude of the servers I can most confidently place upon a large, awkward man claiming to be the owner. He attempted to talk our ears off while my friend drank her gluten-free beer, at least they have a few of those, though most are $9 Belgian imports. Clearly he has no ability to take social cues as we were obviously not interested, yet his approach became no less vehement. It seemed like he was grasping for straws to not let the conversation end. I'm not usually one to be so rude, but the small amount of talking he did manage to force on us made his incompetence immediately evident. Also, I couldn't help but notice that he didn't leave us alone until a different group of women came in for him to pester. Creep status? Probably. He didn't seem so adamant about talking to the men (myself included) and EVERY employee was an attractive female.\nWill not be back, probably wouldn't have come back even if we could eat. The atmosphere, or lack thereof, and abrasive owner were waaaaay too much of a turn-off to make anything worth it."
0,"I'm freakin' DONE with this place. \nEvery time I come here I get above-average food (good!) with poor service (bad!) \nLast time I was here our server never came back to pick up our check and it took so long that i had to get up and go looking for someone else to get us some change. \nThis time I ordered the soup-and-half-sandwich plate. I was offered chicken noodle or French onion. I went with the onion. When the check came, I was charged extra for the soup. When my server came back to pick up my card (and she took a LONG time to come back around and wasn't even the same server as the time before... is this protocol at this restaurant?) she said \""oh, yeah, that soup costs extra.\"" Interesting, as the surcharge isn't noted on the menu and as a former server myself, I know I should have been told about this when given the choices. \nI won't lie: the food is pretty hearty. But is it worth the flippant service?"
0,"OK...  So, my friends and I used to go to Twin Peaks in Scottsdale.  It was fun, but it took 30 minutes to get there, so we didn't go very often.  The food was decent and the wait staff was friendly and able to get our orders correct.  It was also packed every day for lunch, which is generally a good sign.\n\nSo, imagine our reaction when a new TP opened up on Camelback!  Awesome!\n\nMy friends went there while I was out of town and said the food and service were awful.  Maybe they ordered wrong...  Maybe they had a bad server.  Who knows.\n\nSo, we went there last week, so I could do a \""quality check\"".  There were 6 of us.  Everyone got their food at different times.  I ordered fish tacos, which was my go to choice at the Scottsdale location.  The first one was OK, the second one was bad.  I stopped eating after one bite.  At least at this time the server was nice and apologized for all the problems in the kitchen.\n\nAnd today...  (You can see that I really gave this place a chance)  We had more people from out of town that wanted to go for a long lunch.  So, despite my friends original bad experience, and another one the week before, we decided to dare the peaks again.\n\nMistake.\n\nOne guy recommended wings as he had them at another TP and said they were \""decent\"".  At this point, \""decent\"" was all I was hoping for.  So, I ordered the wings.  Another person ordered grilled chicken strips.  Same usual fire drill.  Long wait for the food, and then everyone receives their meals at different times.  The waitress told my friend with the chicken strips, \""Don't worry, your chicken tacos will be out soon.\""  Um, that's not what I ordered...  I don't want to imagine what happened when she ran away from the table.  \n\nWell, the wings were awful.  I challenged myself to eat 3 of them (the most cooked looking ones I could see) and stole some fries from others.  \n\nWhen the grilled chicken strips finally arrived, they looked disgusting.  Like someone had microwaved some chicken strips and then tried to put some grill marks on them.  I told my friend not to eat them.\n\nAnd then.  Oh, there's an and then?  Why yes there is.  The checks.  There were 8 of us.  One guy was paying for 3 people and everyone else was paying separately.  We do this almost daily without issue.  The waitress came back to the table about 4 times before everything was finally corrected and signed.  \n\nThe one thing I will say, is that it doesn't seem to be the fault of the wait staff.  This place clearly suffers from BAD MANAGEMENT.  I will never go back."
0,"I've been to this store over and over again because a friend keeps dragging me along, but have never found anything that tempted me in the least.  Much of the stuff is obviously worn out, damaged, or passed over for a good reason.  This isn't a necessary feature of a \""last call\"" type of store--I just think this particular store is useless."
0,"I thought Southwest was bordering on ghetto, but Spirit makes it look like British Airways.  It was .... barely serviceable for the price.  It was a short trip to Vegas, but it smelled a little like the public parking lots in Santa Monica - namely, urine.  The seats reminded me of folding chairs with a worn-out cushion.  There's a charge, it was $25 as I recall, for any carry-on bag other than a personal item, not to mention the charge for checked items."
0,"Food was good but our waitress was horrible. She messed up the order (what is so hard about eggs and toast). It also took almost 15 minutes to get water and an orange juice! There are too many places in Vegas to get a good meal at and therefore, I think I will keep walking by the Grand Lux next time I in the area."
1,"We ate here sober (rare I know!) but it was still delicious! We had to try it since we tried the one in Disney world, florida. \n\nThere was a long line when we went but it moved pretty fast.\n\nworth a try!"
0,"This review is for the customer service and management. I purchase a yelp deal ($10 for $15) and the manager or owner basically did everything possible to stop me from using the deal. We first arrived on a sunday morning, and after showing our yelp deal, the owner claimed the deal was only valid on weekdays. No where on the details of the deal does it state that the deal would only be applicable on weekdays, however, I still decided to give it a try. We asked the waitress what else we needed to know about the deal and she said as long as we came in on a weekday, we would be able to show the deal and use it. The second time we came back, the waitress claimed we couldn't use the deal because we didn't print out the offer......ok, no where on the deal does it state we have to print this offer, it says to show them the redemption code (as with all other yelp deals). We asked to speak to the manager and the waitress came back saying \""oh he's busy right now.\"" We asked if we could wait because we're from LA so we don't have every opportunity to come out here. She came back saying \""he says you cannot use the deal. There's nothing I can do about this...\"" we turn around and clearly see the manager just standing in the kitchen not doing anything. We asked one more time if we could speak to him and she came back and said \""he's too busy to talk to you, you cannot use the deal...\"" Honestly, he couldn't even come out and tell us himself? He had to pretend he was \""busy\"" and send her saying the same thing each time. WORST customer service ever - it's not even about the deal, the fact is he couldn't event take 2 minutes of his time to come talk to a customer. If they really dont want you to use the deal - why offer one? Obviously, the deal is no longer on yelp. I will never return, and I highly advise you do the same as the food was nothing to rage about and customer service seems to be  non existent."
1,"Short but sweet. \n\nBring your mac. Ambience is perfect for doing work or facebooking for hours. Yes, it's now a verb.\n\nBlueberry chicken salad. It's the only entree I've ever tried because it is so darn tasty. I swap the chips for a salad and throw it on the sammy to feel better about life and the two chocolate chip cookies proceeding the bcs. \n\nWhy not 5 stars? Where the customer service is terrific (the nice man taking orders must also taste test for coffee quality control for as much enthusiasm and zeal pouring out of this guy) a to go order takes longer than a bike ride around Lake Mendota, regardless of how busy or slow. Call it in, yelpers, and enjoy."
1,"I recently moved to this area from California and signed up for membership after my first facial. Fantastic service and facial given by Kristi R. I felt relaxed the entire time and the treatment was great. The reception staff were efficient and explained how the membership works without being too pushy. They sold me and I'm happy I joined. No long-term commitment makes it very attractive and affordable, especially comparing prices to California spas. The facility is clean and well organized. Nice waiting area as well. Give them a try!"

1,"I contacted Eco-Tint via their website email on Sunday the 31st over Labor Day weekend, and I was not expecting a response till that following business day, which would be Tuesday. To my surprise I received a response within 15 minutes, I couldn't believe it. I contacted the owner Mike on Tuesday to schedule an appointment for Thursday. I came into the shop was greeted by Jay within 3 minutes, he explained my options with a friendly smile. I turned my keys over and proceeded to the waiting room. A comfortably cool room with complimentary A&W Root Beer (my absolute favorite)and wifi. 30 minutes later my truck was done!\nI'm terribly IMPRESSED by the attentive, quick and professional service that was delivered by Mike, Jay and the whole Eco-Tint crew. Thanx!"
1,"I don't see what the hype is about although the food was good. Some say it's way better than In-N-Out but I think it's about the same. Their burgers have a genuine grilled smokey taste kind of like when Burger King's when it first came out and got popular. Of course the quality of FG is much much much muuuuch better than burger king because of their fresh and relatively healthier ingredients.\n\nTheir fries were crispy on the outside and soft inside. They are fresh potatoes too but have a different texture than in n out. I gotta say I love in n out fries but for those who hate in n out fries I would think you would love FG's fries. I think I heard that they fry their fries in peanut oil or something so if you have peanut allergies be sure to ask and if true, avoid for the sake your life!\n\nOverall a great experience but nothing crazy."
1,"FABULOUS CAMBODIAN CUISINE!  \n\nJust like being on an exotic vacation tasting new flavors from top chef pretty platters in almost a Cambodian Museum .\n\nThis small restaurant is easy to miss depending on your direction driving here because the sign is only painted on one side of restaurant . Once you walk in you see a display of Cambodian relics including very old musical instruments , nick nacks  and visitor books on Cambodia on every table .\n\nOur server was very friendly and welcoming and understood we needed a little time to decide . \n\nI decided on the Loc Lak , it was pan fried beef cubes over a salad platter that came with  pickled green papaya and carrot salad , egg roll and steamed white rice . This dish was prettier than I can describe but it was also more tasty than I can describe as well . I tasted unusual flavors I never tasted before that were very good sort of tangy slightly garlic almost a mint flavor but not mint and a lingering honeysuckle note in my throat . The beef was very tender not fatty or oily one bit but it needs to be mentioned that it was a very small portion of beef my guess is two ounces . I also really enjoyed the green papaya carrot salad it was so light and fresh but also spicy , every thing on the platter was very light and fresh and a very nice meal overall .\n\nMy husband had the House Made Beef Sausage platter that also came with steamed rice , egg roll and pickled salad . This platter is a very generous serving of meat you get four sausages that are seasoned in a sweet and sour way and are very good .\n\nWe were EXTREMELY HAPPY with our visit and also spent VERY LITTLE the two meals only cost less than $20 we hope to visit again soon . Also a BYOB"
1,"Very pretty inside!  Great prices!  The service was a little slow, but the food was great!  The tortilla soup was my fav!  The chicken fajitas are only $8.99 with your players boarding pass!  They also have a nice sized salsa bar with a great selection of salsas, from mild to extra hot!  You really cant beat it with the price and taste of food!"
0,"The owners of this salon, Tiffany and Tony, are so rude! I keep going back to this salon because a couple of the nail techs, Vincent and David, are very good at what they do, and because the salon is so close to me.  I have been going here for almost two years, and to this day Tiffany has never greeted me or called me by name and acts like she has never seen me before when I walk in! Tony use to be friendly to me, but must have been \""reprimanded\"" for being a little too friendly and no longer even speaks to me! If it weren't for the convenience and two very skilled techs, Vincent and David, I would not go back, but have tried several other salons and have not found anyone who does nails like David and Vincent at Tips and Toes. I sure don't go back to Tips and Toes because of the owners!"
1,We were slightly intimidated by the detail in our painting. Once we got going and following along we had SO much fun. Robert and the entire team were fabulous. We highly recommend Design and Wine.
1,"My favorite Vietnamese place in Tempe. I've been going here for four years and have introduced it to many of my friends, which they all enjoy! The food has always been consistent, meaning that the soup taste fabulous everytime you dine in. I would highly recommend the pho, summer rolls, and eggrolls."
1,I have been dealing with these guys for years. They have always been helpful and polite. When I ran into a problem they helped me out better than I expected. I highly recommend them!
1,"What? 3 stars only? This place is gold!!!!\n\nI stumbled upon this place years ago, when I lived around the corner. And fell in love! Sure, it's small and can be cramped on the weekend--- but that makes it cozy! The decorations are quaint and cute, making it feel like a dining room from a B&B rather than a restaurant smack in the middle of a strip mall.\n\nThe servers here are nothing but friendly. It's a small, local place, so everyone knows each other. I went so many times that each server started to recognize me.  \n\nBut what really clinches this place is the food. Heavenly breakfasts, my favorite meal, Every time, I order the maple french toast--- soo good! Add to that a maple muffin, and it's sweet carb heaven. They used to serve great sausages here, too, but changed the menu. Disappointing, but wouldn't keep me away!\n\nI recently moved to L.A., and have yet to find a replacement for Maple Tree. It sucks, because it was our tradition to go here every weekend. I can't wait to go back, next time I'm in town!"
1,"Looking for a new chinese food joint after our neighborhood place, Full Ho, closed at 95 and Jones.  Checked Yelp and decided to give this a try.  Went for lunch with my brother and ordered from the lunch specials, plus an extra apetizer of moo shu pork.  I had the mongolian beef and my brother had the chicken with lemon sause.  Both came with fried rice and a spring roll.  Large portions priced right.  The food was all excellent, flovorful, spicey and great service.  This is my new place to go!"
1,"5 Stars for this Famous Dave's franchise.\n\nWorth the trip for the smokey tasting Brisket and St Louis Ribs \n\nBoth the Chandler & San Village locations brisket tastes likes it steamed ... not smoked!\n\nThe St Louis Ribs are always so smokey tasting and tender, even beats Haps ribs on an off day ... and I love Haps BBQ ribs. \n\nFamous Dave's is one of the better franchise's in the USA, very consistent and always a great experience. I always eat in the bar because thats how I roll, I  have never been disappointed at any location. However this particular Dave's deserves and extra star for doing a better job smoking the meats. While I live closer to San Tan, I usually drive the extra distance to get my fix here\n\nOnly downside to Dave's is the corporate selection of beer, local microbrew's would have be visiting more often."
0,"Had lunch here today with Robyn N. Jeromy H. and Rand H, Well for starters almost everything at the buffet was room temp. The food was not bad but would have been better hot.The soft serve ice cream was a real watery type. Any way dont waste your time here there is better across the street."
1,"We've been to Hokkaido a few times now, each time leaving full and happy with our meal. There's a decent variety of the traditional Chinese-restaurant fare, which isn't anything ridiculously impressive but probably above-average by buffet standards.\n\nThey do have a grilling station where you can choose various meats and other ingredients, and have it cooked for you. I didn't partake, so can't comment on the quality of this offering. They offered a pretty decent variety of what I'd consider decent sushi by buffet standards that seems to rotate pretty frequently, and includes things from super tame (California rolls) to the fishier offerings (tuna, eel, etc). There's also a selection of things that could appeal to kids that got dragged along and don't enjoy Asian food, such as pizza, chicken wings, and other traditional fare.\n\nIt'd be unfair to leave out their dessert section, which includes all kinds of fruit with a chocolate fountain, ice cream, various puddings, fruit salads... the offerings do seem to change between visits, which keeps things new.\n\nLunch is a bit cheaper (it's what we've usually gone for), but dinner includes crab legs on the buffet for your extra money. Overall, this is a pretty solid buffet that I'd recommend and will certainly return to in the future, but wouldn't go too far out of my way for."
0,just moved to san tan valley and ordered the 3 cheese pizza and another large PIZZA when i picked it up and got home my family dived in....after we tryed the 3 cheese there was no cheese in the crust what so ever maybe a tiny bit and thats being nice...I called and asked for the manager when the lady came on the phone i explained the situation and she proceeded to argue with me saying that i should of inspected my pizza when i picked it up... since i ate half the pizza that there was nothing she could do my father got on the phone and she had agreed to replace the pizza i came back on the phone and gave my address and she then copped an attitude with me and when gave my cross roads she instintily said that we were out of the delivery area...omg these people are something else i then talked to the general manager after arguing with the manger for 20 mins about dam cheese in the crust he proceeded to argue some more finally i said to just give me his name and hers I was done arguing with them and he hung up on me!!!!  Are you serious right now omg i called back and he told me I was 86s from his pizza hut that i got what i ordered bullshit  NEVER BEEN TREATED LIKE THAT IN MY LIFE!!!!
0,"This is the worst of the Yardhouse locations in Phoenix.  The parking is a royal pain, there's often a wait, and this place gets annoyingly loud during popular sporting events.  Somehow this semi-yuppified place manages to attract all of the thugs who would normally go to a sleezy sports bar and scream at the TV there when their team is losing.  This Yardhouse is in a shopping mall, please go somewhere else.\n\nService & food quality are the same as the other Yardhouse locations in the valley.  Beer selection is great but not so great.  If you're a beer enthusiast, you've already tried at least 90% of the beers.  If you're not a beer enthusiast, you probably won't care that there's so many beers to choose from.  I think they missed the mark by having tons of widely available beers at one place rather than having a lot of hard to find beers that people will like to try for the first time.\n\nPrices are too high - $6 pints, $10 for most appetizers, and again - this location is bad for parking and customers."
0,"I have mixed feelings about what I think here, been a few times, like a lot of the food on the menu especially the nachos, pizza is awesome and tried the burger and was content!\nAlthough the service is not always the best, few times we walked in they told us the kitchen was closed ( 10 pm Saturday night) that we can go to the bar..\nAnother time they dint want us to go in the dinning room cause it was apparently closing and we had to sit at the bar with the loud music.\nAnother time we asked for an appetizer and it wasn't cooked ( was frozen in the middle)\nWell ok they were nice about it, gave us another plate for free but still it turned me off completely! I've been to other boston pizzas in mtl qc and had better service!\nThe one in lasalle is being managed by young careless people!\nI give it 3 stars."
0,"The experience is not really worth the price. Yes, it's amazing, no it's not worth over $100 a head. On top of that, they attempted to rip us off. We arrived at 4:30 and were told that one of the food places would be open until 6:00. With that in mind, we bought a ticket package that included food. When we arrived at the food stop at 5:30, it was closed\n\nAnd then they attempted to tell us that they would not refund our food costs and that it was our fault for being there too late. After that, they then said that they couldn't refund our money because the credit card machines were down...as people were standing in line and buying souvenirs with their credit cards. \n\nNot worth the hassle. What a joke."
0,"Wifi doesn't work half the time. Skip the overpriced room service ($28+ for yogurt and berries??) and the overpriced watered-down drinks. No bathrobes in the room. \n\nWorst part was a staffmember trying to enter and then INSISTENTLY banging on the door as I was trying to take a nap to ask if I wanted the room cleaned. The room had already been cleaned AND the Do Not Disturb sign was on the door. \n\nIf the Do Not Disturb sign is up you don't try to come in and you definitely don't bang insistently on the door!!!\n\nThis is the type of crap I would expect at Motel 6, not a supposed 4 or 5 star hotel on the Las Vegas strip. \n\nSkip this place. There are much better options on the strip for similar pricing."
0,"Atmosphere - five stars.  Food - two stars.  Value - zero stars.\n\nFig Tree is in a beautiful old home, and I think it is the prettiest (and most romantic) restaurant I have been to in Charlotte.  Sadly, spending time in the house requires that you eat the food - and that's not something you really want to subject yourself to...\n\nThere are some positives to mention about Fig Tree.  I have been there for dinner on two separate occasions.  Each time, the service was good.  At the first meal, our server was particularly attentive and friendly.  A HUGE positive in Fig Tree's favor is that they do try very, very hard to provide great customer service.  Before my first visit I called the restaurant to ask about vegetarian options.  I spoke with someone from the kitchen, and he assured me that they could provide options that were not on the menu.  I was very impressed.  \n\nI have also been very impressed with the wine/champagne that I have had at Fig Tree.  At the first dinner, we had a half bottle of Lang and Reed Cab. Franc.  It is really hard to find, and it is an incredible treat when I get the chance to have it.  The second dinner I went to was a champagne dinner, and the champagne pairings were wonderful.  \n\nSadly, the food at Fig Tree has been a major disappointment.  At my first meal, I ordered a special which included a steak and a crab cake.  The steak was mediocre.  There was very little flavor, and the quality of the meat seemed totally inappropriate for the type of restaurant that Fig Tree aspires to be.  (To be fair, my vegetarian companion enjoyed her pasta dish.)  If the steak was mediocre, then the crab cake didn't get close to being mediocre.  It was one of the worst crab cakes I have ever had - at any restaurant.  I was shocked.  On my second visit to Fig Tree a friend was treating me to a champagne dinner.  I literally can't remember a single course... Not a good sign for such a memorable event.  \n\nI feel as though I have to try Fig Tree one more time, for so many people seem to love this restaurant... But, for now, I would recommend that you spend your money elsewhere if you are looking for a restaurant for a special evening."
1,"This review is long overdue.  I came here with my wife little more than two years ago, a day after we got engaged.  This was our second stop after I proposed to her at The Edison in LA.\n\nWe had the pre-fixe dinner menu which was about $90/person and included amuse bouche, appetizer, entree, and a dessert.  I can't remember everything we ate here but both of us still remember the venison chop with huckleberry reduction sauce and ginger mojito.  Those were some of the best things we ever ate/drank.  The venison was super tender and huckleberry reduction was excellent.  Ginger mojito was the best mojito we ever had.  We both loved the ginger foam at the top.  \n\nThe service was very professional but somewhat stiff, almost corporate.\n\nPlace looks upscale and romantic.  Most of the couples were seated by the window where you can get a nice view of the Bellagio water show.  You definitely need to dress up to dine here.  The decor can be a hit or miss depending on lighting and time of day.  During night it looks quite spectacular, but during the day, it may look like a typical gaudy Vegas decor."
0,"Okay, so for ambience-  I gave this place stars.  BUT,  if this were just based on the food-  I would give no starts.  My husband is Italian and his father owned to traditional Italian restaurants in our home town.  That being said,  we still appreciate the modern twist to Italian too; however, this was neither.  They make their own pasta-  but it's is sticky, tastless and chewy.  It was aweful.  My husband and I both got pasta dishes and on both-  they cook forgot things that were supposed to be cooked into the pasta.  My huband got a spinach pasta,  the guy forgot to cook it in-  so his thought-  put the pasta from the plate back in the skillet,  add in the spinach and mix it around a couple of times.  Needless to say,  it was like cold raw spinach leaves with your hot pasta-- didn't really go.  The other thing-  no one is coming around and refilling drinks or taking your plates or bringing you your food-  so why would you have that massive clear box for tip money (right where the hostess is) when you go up to pay.  It just seemed tacky. \n\nYou can't have it both ways-  either you are like a deli where you order at the counter and get your food- or have someone come around and at least refill your drinks, bus your tables (which was not done) and making sure everything is okay. \n\nI think this place has potential - but it just totally misses the mark.  The other thing-  if you want a drink-  you've go to go to the bar to order it,  then you have to go to this line for this,  then this line for that-  just doesnt make that much sense to me."
1,"So get my money on time, if they not money, decline\nI just can't worry 'bout no haters, gotta stay on my grind\nNow tell me, who that, who that? That do that, do that?\nPut that paper over all, I thought you knew that at...JULIAN SERRANO! - Iggy Azalea (fancy)\n\nI would normally never intentionally wait 40 mins for a paella in Vegas (where time is money). Since it was Labor Day weekend, we had more time and because I've walked by this place so many times, we finally decided to try this place for a late lunch. Most of the tapas were strong in flavor, including the steak, but the seafood paella stole the show. The lobster, clams, mussels, and shrimp all blended in together and its a dish we would never be able to replicate correctly at home so bravo! Dessert was also yummy.\n\nI'd recommend a paella and 2-3 tapas a person and you're good to go for a pleasant dining experience!"
1,"Great place for breakfast or lunch. Even when crowded, the wait is never too long. The food is really good and the wait staff are always very attentive and food arrives promptly. We feel that it can be a little pricey, so not a real bargain, but consistently good."
0,"Went there on a Saturday afternoon for happy hour.  Initially our server was rude & nasty, we ordered drinks & waters...the drinks took 10 minutes for four drinks.  The water never came.  \n\nWe did end up ordering wings (soggy), nachos (good), shrimp cocktail (good) & a Mexican app (okay).  The service did get a bit better & the water did finally come after we asked a couple times.\n\nThe decor is a little strange now that they moved into another place that used to be a clubby place, but it's a newer spot for them.  \n\nI might go back to give them 1 more chance...\""might\""."
0,"Had to pay $1.50 for a parking spot out front. Not a good start...\n\n12:30pm on a Friday and there was no line. Another bad sign... \n\nThe atmosphere was bright, urban hipster. That's cool. The service was prompt and friendly. Lots of goodies in the display case. Yay! Things are looking up.\n\nThe Blackberry Jasmine Green Tea was crisp and fresh. Only sat for a few minutes when my food was delivered and boy, did it look good!  Unfortunately, that's where the good part ends...\n\nIt may have been the prettiest Tuna Melt I've eaten in a long time but it was also one of the worst. I used five napkins--FIVE!--to sop up all the dripping mayonnaise from this tuna salad that was spewing all over my plate/side salad/table/lap. Yuck. When are restaurants going to learn that you only put enough mayo in tuna salad to hold the ingredients together??? I'm sorry, but if you hold up a tuna sandwich and it all drips out, you've done something wrong. Such a shame because it really did look pretty on the plate... \n\nI was even more disappointed to find that they drenched the side salad in WAY too much balsamic dressing, so I abandoned that completely.\n\nAnd the final nail in the coffin was the \""Ncounter\"" signature dessert which is a combination brownie/oreo/chocolate-chip cookie. It was $4 and I only took one bite. SO DRY! Ugh.\n\nI had wanted to try them again for breakfast sometime but I really doubt that I will."
1,Amazing when Chef Beni is in the kitchen. The Sherry Garlic Camarones are amazing.
0,"I went with a group of 8 on a Tuesday night. We arrived at an empty restaurant, and were sat 5 minutes later in the corner by the kitchen in a busy pathway. The waitress didn't put 2 of the meals on the bill so they came about 15 minutes later than everyone elses, also forgot an appetizer. Not that it was going well anyway, multiple people felt very sick after eating. Not somewhere I would go again."
1,"We visited Las Vegas in May for a genealogy convention, and took an extra day to visit the sights in the area.  Hoover Dam and Rick's Restorations were the only two MUST see attractions that I was looking forward to.  The Hoover Dam was awesome (as it always is).  Our trip to Rick's Restorations was off the charts.  We were greeted the moment we got out of our vehicles by a very nice man who explained how the tours went and even signed us up for a raffle to fly back to Vegas to be there for the show (unfortunately we didn't get picked.  We then went on an excellent tour with another gentleman who did a fantastic job.\n\nYou guys have done a great job with the show and the tour experience, making your fans feel like they are part of your family.  Thank you so much for all of the attention you give to your followers.  If I ever come across a worthwhile project, I will certainly bring it to Rick's to have you guys work your magic on it.  Thanks again"

1,Great place! Good pizza that tastes great and is very authentic! We had a mushroom and sausage and we were very impressed. You won't be disappointed!
0,"I just got home from dining at Renegade Canteen, and I've gotta say...not worth it, at all. I'm a big Roaring Fork fan, which is why I agreed to eat here, but this place didn't live up to RF's standards as far as I could tell.\n\nTo be fair, the service was lovely. Perfectly timed everything, not overbearing, happy to answer every question, took special orders without sighing as most servers do, and what was most noticeable was every server appeared to be at least 30 years old. They were very professional.\n\nTo begin, I browsed the cocktail menu and didn't see a drink that jumped out to me, but I did notice they had a prickly pear mojito, so I asked if it would be possible to have a prickly pear martini. They were happy to oblige, and it was delicious. This was probably the highlight of the evening.\n\nThe bread they brought out was decent, and there were two butter options, one plain and one herbed. Another really cool thing was our table-we had a large party and the table was huge and round, and there was a separate round top piece of the table that rotated around, making it easy to pass items between people.\n\nFor apps, most of my party ordered salads. I decided to branch out and ordered the crab meat \""enchiladas\"", which tasted like old fishy canned tuna, served wrapped in lettuce. It advertised a \""mango vinaigrette\"", which was seen only as a teeeeeny tiny drop on the plate. It should be noted that this bite tasted neither mango-y or like a vinaigrette. I had a bite of bf's plain side salad, which was alright, but that's pretty hard to screw up.\n\nEntrees: I ordered the spinach crepes, which sounded awesome on the menu. Unfortunately, they were REALLY bland, and just didn't taste good at all. They were basically sauteed spinach and chopped pumpkin wrapped in a spinach \""crepe\""...but the crepe was incredibly dry and not good at all. It's served with two crepes, and I could barely make myself finish one.\n\nI had a bite of the pot roast, which was pretty solid, and much tastier than my crepes, but as for the rest  of the entrees ordered (chicken, tagliatelle with truffle sauce, chicken flatbread), no one seemed wow-ed enough to finish. The burger that was ordered was reminiscent of Roaring Fork's \""Big Ass Burger\"", but was not reported to be as good  as their version.\n\nFor a party of 7 people, you'd think if you ordered only 2 desserts, they'd be gobbled up with no problem. Not for us. The pecan pie and the ovaltine with rice krispy treat were passed around at least five times, and still no one could finish either. The pecan pie was served in a round metal dish and had ice cream on top, and the entire thing was sickly sweet, with no real crust to speak of, just sugary pecans. The ovaltine thing was about five things on a plate that were all bad-\""frozen\"" ovaltine, which tasted like a bad chocolate mousse, stale cocoa and regular rice krispy treats, a caramelized banana, and \""black caramel sauce\"", which no one could figure out and no one enjoyed. All of us are sweets people, I would like to point out, so it takes a lot for us to not finish a dessert!\n\nOverall, I'd never go back here, but I'd still go to Roaring Fork (especially for their happy hour). The prices at Renegade Canteen aren't outrageous, but they're wayyy too high for the quality of food they're serving!"
1,"Went there yesterday and got a sub, it was great.  Bread is the best, real chewy, almost sourdough like, without being stale.   People making my sandwich were really nice and friendly, cute too!    I got a number 8....don't remember the name of it.  The only downside is I didn't eat it right away and it got a little soggy because there's a lot of mayonnaise on it.  Don't get me wrong, I like a lot of mayonnaise, so I didn't have a problem with it.  Just didn't know it would get soggy if it sat.  The solution to this problem, eat that sub as soon as you get it..and I will.  I'll be back, Jimmy Johns!"
1,Wonderful coffee!  Very good wifi. Some outdoor seating.
0,"La Condesa, I give up on you. We try and try to excuse the terrible service, but no more. It's not worth it. It's too slow and inattentive and they just don't give a damn, so I'll take my $33 elsewhere.\n\nThis time we were disappointed by the food, too. We returned our horchata for being too thin and tasteless, and you brought us new ones after we finished eating. You drizzled a pretty crema all over the top of my torta (sorry, lonche). How do I pick it up and eat it? \n\nIn the past we forgave the dirty tables and loudness because your cochinita pibil was pure bliss. But not even that makes up for the service. :("
0,"Place could use a thorough scrubbing and updating of decor. Service was very good, but only about three tables of customers as we went in during late afternoon. The food was just okay and certainly not very good like it used to be there."
1,"Friendly service, my won ton and hot and sour were good. The Garlic Eggplant was a bit sweet for my taste. Great prices, generous portions and overall good food!"
0,"I've been here one time before to get a drug screen and physical for my job. Had a long wait then, but I didn't really care that day. Yesterday, I came here for a drug screen and check up after a car accident. The girl at the desk told me to \""give her a minute\"" to get me in the system and they'd get me in. Hour and a half later, I ask if she knows how much longer, as I have to pee but have to hold it for the drug test, plus headache, nausea, and not to mention covered in blood. Kinda want outta here. I was told they have a high number of \""urgent injuries\"" so it's taking longer. Uhhhhhhh ?? I mean, I don't know what their definition of urgent is, but I didn't see anyone else with blood. \n\nFinally get seen and they told me I need to go to ER immediately (hey thanks for the wait!) for a ct scan. And they forgot to give me a tetanus shot. \n\nI just hope I don't have to come back to this place. It's too long of a wait."
0,"This was my second visit to this store in the last 10 years. The furniture is actually not bad, but the sales people drive me insane. I will never buy anything in this store. Well, actually I'll never go there again. My first visit involved me walking around looking while a sales person slowly lagged behind me. I'd run to one side of the store and think that I was rid of her, and turn my head and there she was. The exact same thing happened today. My partner and I started playing cat and mouse and she fell for it. It was really quite comical. We ended up running out of the store to see if she would beat us to the front. We won, but barely. After announcing when I first walked in that I was just there looking and did not need assistance, that should have been enough of a message for them to LEAVE US ALONE! Well it wasn't, but it was enough for me to get the message to LEAVE THEM ALONE!"
0,"My boyfriend and I love sushi and have had many in Charlotte. We thought we tried this one since we bought a groupon for it. This is by far THE worst place I have been for sushi and service. I was disappointed in the food and our server. Took forever to receive our sushi. But what made the night worse was when I showed them my groupon through my app off my phone they refused to take it saying they needed a printed copy to put in the computer. I, being a server myself, and also having to have dealt with groupons couldn't understand why she wouldn't accept my groupon. So we had an argument for 5 minutes. Than my boyfriend asked for a manager and we were told no one was in other than the cashier. GREAT! The cashier calls the manager and comes back to tell me the most she can do is take 20 percent off my tab. Tab was 59.43 and through groupon I had paid 15 for 30 so I was infuriated to say the least. Even showing the damn groupon receipt and what it in tells that I am entitled to she still denied my 30 dollars off. So we told her we will not pay for anything on the tab because now we're being ripped off. Needless to say after 30 minutes of arguing and being chased down they finally took my groupon and we were able to pay. I will NEVER come back here again nor recommend anyone, especially w groupon."
0,"Went here to grab a quick dinner before heading back to the room. I wasn't that hungry so I decided to order their sliders. MISTAKE. I know they are sliders but I was expecting them a tad bigger and maybe like 3-4 of them instead of two plain bite size burgers and four potato chips? I ended up spending $20 for it with a soda, tax, and tip. I hate spending money on food and leaving unsatisfied!  The people I went with said their regular burgers (I think they ordered the kobe beef) were the best burgers they ever had so I will definitely come back here again to try one of their regular sized ones. Either that or the salmon burger looked real good too. I want to like this place so maybe next time I try it I will."
0,Visited this club while on a trip to AZ for a Niners game; from LA. Not a very diverse or diversity friendly club my boyfriend and I and another couple (who all happen to be African American) we followed around by the security and the $100 bill we paid for drinks and tips with was passed around several times to validate it's validity. \n\nA few dancers did an excellent job with pole dancing and tricks but the music wasn't really good (not that we needed to hear rap or hip hop) mostly old rock music and no name house music. I would not recommend.
0,"I moved out here from Chicago about 7 months ago and some friends of mine that live in my apartment complex told me to check out this bar.  It is what it is.  It's a freaking dive bar that smells like farts.  For anyone familiar with the Chicagoland area, it reminded me a bit like Bridgeport.  That same peanuts and nasty fart smell that occupies stank ass Bridgeport and Stickney.  Needless to say, I love sports but hate dive bars.  There's no disguises here.  If you're looking for a dive bar/a place just to stop off and grab a beer without looking your best, come here."
0,"Update: I asked for my medical records and guess what?  Both incomplete and inaccurate!  Surprise!  They didn't do full intake on me during my multiple visits so just \""copied\"" what was there. Also, no radiology reads on 2 of 3 imaging session which means going to another doc they will typically not accept the image, only the printed report from the radiologist.  (Like I was born yesterday.)\n\nI have a call in to them to try and get the records corrected ad to get the balance of the documents all I can add is SHEESH!!!\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nJust when I thought it couldn't get any worse.  A place that treats by the joint when you have multiple joint problems a place that obviously doesn't think about the patient but more about billings.\n\nI called today to find out when my apointment with another doc was.  I called May 6th to reschedule it from tomorrow to another day but forgot to write down the new day.  As it turns out, that doctor only works Monday and Wednesday and only time I can get out of work early are Tues & Thurs which is why I called to reschedule the appointment they made for me without asking my availability!\n\nSo... Dr. Ashman has issued a \""divorce of care letter\"".  Oh gee.  I'm so hurt.  It won't prevent me from seeing the 2 doctors at this practice who have already given me less than 3 minutes of their time but I will no longer be able to go to Nevada Orthopedic.\n\nROFL!  Perhaps Dr. Ashman doesn't realize that before you get a divorce you have to get married and because I NEVER saw him because he walked out on me, kind of hard to get a divorce.... but I did refuse his proposal that I wait longer than the 40 minutes I had already been there because I had my cell phone in my hand when he finally walked in the room.\n\nBTW...when I was in the elevator going down after I left Ashman's office I was grumbling and someone in scrubs asked me what was up.  I said I was waiting for a doc that was 40 minutes late and he got mad because I had my cell phone in my hand (not talking, just checking work e-mails, etc since the wait was so long.... and I told him Ashman walked out and I walked out on him a few minutes later)  Reply for the guy in scrubs?  \""Good for you.  He treats everyone that way\""\n\nJust as an FYI, when I saw another doctor for another joint, he was well over an hour late and while he wasn't overtly rude, the rest of the staff had gone home and he clearly wanted to as well so I got the bums rush with a quick referral to MRI)\n\nIt seems to me that if this place cared about their patients, they might want to look about their process that makes patients wait so long, see so many doctors and allows doctors to be so overtly rude.  Any other place would have FIRED an employee for being such a rotten egg.  MD or not if you hate your job so much and hate people so much... time to look for another job!"
1,"I often wondered why Gorgie Road smelled like shit. Turns out because there is a farm on it! Who knew!\n\nSo this is where mothers bring their children in their buggies during the week. I was intrigued by the whole city farm idea, especially when Edinburgh is actually a pretty small city which is surrounded by farms. But it has its purpose. Entry is by donation and as this place is run by volunteers and funded by donations, it is worth giving up a few quid. There are chickens, goats, a sheep and lots of small animals. I think it is more geared towards very young kids, as older kids will be all like \""a sheep, so what?\"" \n\nThere is also a produce stand selling various produce from the farm. It perhaps isn't as exciting as a day out at the zoo, but it is cheap, there is a bus stop outside and will entertain the young kids for a few hours."
0,"The poutine here wasn't that great. For 6$, you get a relatively small sized serving (which is good I guess, if you're worried about the numbers on the scale). The cheese was definitely 'squeaky', but the fries tasted like they were in the fryer too long (i.e. they tasted burnt) and the gravy was nothing to write home about. But being in a state of inebriation, I still ate the entire thing. Such is life.\n\nConsidering Frites Alors is just down the street, I recommend going there instead."
1,"The real win here is the ambiance - it's got a sortof retro loungy feel.  Order yourself a drink, slink into a booth, listen to the music... ahhh a very nice change of pace in Vegas.\n\nI ordered the grilled octopus appetizer and the braised carrots (with some sortof delicious harisa cream sauce)... I was in love with my food.  My fiance ordered some sortof redmeat dish, maybe a steak and his was just mediocre.\n\nThe service was perfect - we were seated right away with no hassles.\nI'd definitely recommend The Barrymore to anyone in the mood for an \""off the beaten path\"" location and experience.  Sortof an old Vegas feel."
1,"I love it, fresh, crispy, and juicy, in a word delicious.  They are doing something right because the chicken is fried but it never comes across as greasy.  I don't know where to start describing the sauce they have but at first I was sad they didn't have BBQ but now I can't get enough of it, like a pepper cream sauce?  The menu is real simple and all they have are chicken strips and some sides but if thats what you want you won't find any better.  Oh ya there fries are like dell tacos but always hot and crispy and I love the texas toast.  \n\nIf you didn't know you can swap out sides in the box combos no charge so sometimes  I'll swap out the cole slaw for a second toast but then I am full for days.\n\nAll three locations I have been to have been the same and consistent."
1,"Ok... Read all the reviews & still decided to eat here. Glad I did. Don't drink the water, it's tap. Service was friendly & on spot! I love eating at nice places, usually downtown... This place had a great atmosphere the food is above par. I ordered  the scallops & my husband ordered the ribs. He was not a fan of the sauce... It's not traditional BBQ sauce & he is more a meat guy. The scallops had great flavor but order a side salad, there are no greens serviced with dish. We will be back."
1,"This place is amazing. The soups, especially, are fantastic. The flavors are very complex and the ingredients always taste fresh.  If you like things spicy, you can specify that with your order and you won't be disappointed. Reasonable prices, too.\n\nTheir Atwood location has more space than the Williamson Street location, and slightly better ambiance.\n\nExpect a long wait on take-out."
1,"I've been a longtime conoisseur of Korean food, and this place is just awesome.  Definitely my favorite Korean restaurant in Champaign-Urbana, very authentic and down-to-earth.  The older couple that runs it is always there, considerate and hard-working.  The counter staff has always been very polite and helpful.  My favorite dish by far is the BBQ fresh bacon (I recommend this HIGHLY), but all of the dishes I've had from Woori Jib have been delicious.  The stir fried dishes come in large portions and have a nice mix of vegetables along with the meat.  The tofu stew is also very good combined with any meat, but is pretty spicy if ordered above mild, so bear this in mind.  The grilled fishes are salty and cooked just right.  The dumplings have a hand-made form and taste.  The kim chee is not as varied as at some restaurants, but also tastes \""fresh\"" (as fresh as kim chee should be) and home-made.  If you do have a wait (which is common for any BBQ dishes made to order, at any restaurant), the cabbage soup is there, waiting for you.\nI'm not particular about ambience, so I don't mind that Woori Jib is a bit like a cafeteria.  I'm all about the food and the prices, and those are both excellent at Woori Jib!"
1,"Can I take away a star because I didn't get to see Bobby Flay? No? Ok, fine, five stars it is.\n\nGreat restaurant!  My mom took me for my birthday present while we were in town because I love Bobby Flay (one of my favorite Food Network chefs). We were a bit early for our reservations so we had to wait a few minutes, but we ordered drinks while we waited. Such delicious margaritas! The appetizers we got (the duck pancake and goat cheese dip) were delicious ways to start the meal. I got the halibut and my mom got the pork tenderloin. Both were amazing! We were not going to get dessert but we were intrigued by the spicy peanut butter ice cream on the chocolate pretzel tart. So glad we got that, it was delicious.\n\nI definitely want to go back the next time I am in Vegas!"
1,"typically i'm not a huge fan of artifact and cultural exhibits.  However, the Heard experience was beyond expectations.   The 7.50 student price was reasonable and we were instantly put on a walking tour around the museum. The guides were excellent and the museum is quite historic.   \n\nThe contemporary art pieces are not quite art museum worthy.  However the katina doll collection was awesome.  They have Barry Goldwater's personal collection of Katina dolls on display !    I highly suggest using the guided tours,  because some of the exhibits are difficult to process."
1,"**********TACO TUESDAY*********\n\nMy first ever Taco Tuesday was here.  Went with a LOT of rowdy people and the place was seemingly cool with the huge loud crowd, and even was able to seat us (I'm talking like 50 people).\n\nI got a meal #27, don't remember exactly what it was but it included tacos and beans and was pretty epic-tasting.  The meal combo seemed so perfect that all of my friends got the #27 and loved it just as much.  However, my friend Greg did not get the #27 and was temporarily shunned for doing so. \n\nThe chips are epic, as was the salsa and the interior decor.  \n\nAlso epic are their margaritas (and from what I remember, cheap too).  There is a seperate bar area you can go to get away from your crowd and order drinks.  Bar is especially cool because there are pictures of el guapo and wooden ships to look at while you order/drink.  \n\nCabs were ready and willing to take us back to the strip after we were finished eating.  I rode with chuckyhacks and it was fun.\n\nWOULD GO AGAIN, HAD A BLAST, 11/10 STARS."
1,"GREAT PLACE!!!\n\nDidn't have high expectations when I came into this place. Reminded me of se\u00f1or frogs in most Mexican cities. The inside is nice, mix of dive-pub look. After a few pitchers we were shown the upstairs. That's when this place earned 5 stars. Amazing selection of whiskey and beer. Bartender was knowledgable and easy to talk to. I don't like nightclubs so this is more me speed. Check it out"
1,"Went to the store with an appointment (they even took a re-schedule the same morning). I initially came in to replace only two tires. Then the friendly tech showed me that my other two tires were coming apart at the sidewall on the inside (a major safety issue). The waiting room was clean, and the staff were very polite and friendly. I ended up spending more money than I planned to, but otherwise I would have been at risk of a bad blowout. \n\nGreat experience!"
1,"Thank you Gilbert for getting us this last minute reservation!  Another fellow reviewer summed this place up perfectly...F'ing ridiculous!  First, the wrong thing to do is to order two (yes two) double downs to start the meal...ugh!  They were good, but it ruined me for the rest of the meal.  The eel nuggets were ok, but not bad.  The duck eggs were just sunny side fried with a hash brown side and truffle on top.  Yes, the chalkboard menu was hard to read, but the atmosphere was interesting, our waiter was personable, our very close table mates, who we chatted with throughout the meal with Allison and Greg trying to figure out what the menu said.  And the bacon wrapped cheval...well, let's just say mommy will not be telling the kids about that dish..."
1,"New Year's Eve 2008 and 2009 (highlights)\n\nIt was so good the first time, I came back and spent all kinds of stupid money again...\nC'est Las Vegas\n\nTable Reservations = A must\nExpensive = Ya\nWorth it = Totally\n\nThis club is my favorite in Vegas. The aesthetics are UNBELIEVABLE! I love hanging out on the balcony right next to the main dance floor and looking out at the strip. Tao Beach is the best place to go at night over the summer, but unless you have a table, have fun waiting 30+ minutes in line for a $18 Vodka Red Bull. The decor blows my mind and the go go's in the bathtubs with rose petals on their jumblies (1997 Austin Powers in reference to Fembots) add a real sexy touch. The DJs here always crank the best hip hop from the last two decades. \n\n*DISCLAIMER* Call the club earlier in the day and try to get on the VIP list so you don't have to wait in a line that usually stretches forever. You'll have to arrive before 10PM which is super early for Vegas, but if you show up at midnight, good luck getting in before 1:30. \n\nMuch love for Tao."
1,"Yum, yum and yum!  A neighbor introduced me to this gem and am I certainly appreciative!  This is not a bass-thumping sushi mega-factory, but a small inviting space where the food is the feature attraction.  Everything I tried was fresh and perfectly presented.  Five stars, easy!"
0,"I'm totally disappointed. The sandwich was pretty boring. Although they get kudos for slicing the meat right in front of me. Otherwise, there's just nothing appetizing about their sandwiches."

0,"I really wanted to like these cupcakes, but maybe I've just been spoiled by Chicago cupcakes.  I thought the actual cupcake was just so so but I prefer mine much more moist-- and the frosting was too hard and sugary- not really creamy like I prefer.

0,"Not overly impressed with this place...went with a group of friends and we experienced pretty spotty service with some major mix-ups: a friend who ordered pork quesadillas (if I remember correctly) got halfway through her dish, saying it was pretty bland, before the waitress came back to explain that they'd forgotten to put the meat in her meal...then somehow the meat showed up in the poutine of a friend who'd ordered a meatless one. Said poutine was made with grated mozzarella instead of cheese curds (no excuse for that in Montreal, come on). The waitress wasn't really apologetic which we found a bit offensive considering the scale of the screw up. We ordered the churros for dessert and the waitress told us there would be a \""5 minute wait\"" (we thought it a bit strange that she would mention that since 5 minutes is a perfectly normal length of time to wait for a course to be served, if not short!) - they arrived 30 mins later. Overall the food wasn't bad but not really anything to write home about, and the weird service and mix ups made for a mediocre experience overall."
1,"This is a generous slant on 3.5 stars as this is probably the best experience food wise that I've had at a Fox restaurant. I really, really do want to like them as the atmosphere and service are always second to none but the food usually falls short especially for the prices. The restaurant was quite full, as was Keirland-anybody hear about the recession? No? Good, keep spending and eating at restaurants!! \nGreene House gets major props for the Mission/Arts & Crafts decor (my favorite as it embodies timeless warmth) and a very friendly server!! I ordered the pork tenderloin with penne (mac-n-cheese) and broccoli. The pork was masterfully cooked, the mac-n-cheese was okay and the broccoli was straight out of the bag I don't think it was cooked at all. The house BBQ sauce struck me as almost bitter and not very good, but my buddy just loved it. You know what they say about opinions.......... \nKobe sliders were okay I thought, good fries, and my other two friends had the sweet potato cannelloni and veggie panini which I did not taste but they seemed to enjoy. \nI'd probably go back to Greene House, patrons should check out the $100 gift card pack for Fox Restaurants at Costco for $80 to maximize your value."
0,First...I love Genos.  Today not very satisfied about customer service. I ordered my pizza with a 20-25 minute confirmation on ready.  At 20 minutes I walk in and give my name.  Young lady said your wrongs ate done but looks like your pizza will be ready in a few minutes. 15 minutes later another girl asks me what my order name is.  I give it she looks.  It's under the pile of pizzas that were in the window when I arrived.  I ask why didn't they check originally.  The reply. ..I don't know I just got here.   I watched her for five minutes make boxes with the original girl while I waited.  Not happy. Don't gave these issues with the one on south Higley
1,Very friendly staff. The 5 stars are for my experience with the post office located within the store. The staff there is friendly and they never rush you despite the lines they sometimes have. I work nearby and love being able to quickly drop a piece of mail. I can't vouch for the Hallmark store itself which to be honest is full of knick knacks but I definitely think the postal staff here beats any post office you can find in Phoenix.
1,Love this place.  Fun for sports lovers.  The volleyball courts have nice sand and are great for workouts too.  Friendly staff and fun environment.  Lots of fields and Jersey's Sports Bar is cool with jerseys and memorabilia.
1,"James put in a rear view lcd back up mirror, a drop down dvd player, and a tablet in my dash (nexus 7).  He did an awesome job!  It looks so good, everyone I show is blown away and his prices are great.  I shopped around and had other installers tell me it would be nearly $2000. Just to put the tablet in, James did it easier, faster, less expensive, and much more functional!  It was a tenth of the cost to go Herr than anywhere else.  He saw what I wanted and executed it flawlessly! \nThanks you Lyons Customz MotorSports!"
0,"If this is \""real texas bbq\"" I don't get what all the hype is about.  The meat was dry.  I went there for lunch and ordered a bbq chicken sandwich...simple enough to get right.  My friend didn't enjoy his meal either.  The dessert wasn't all that great either.\n\nOn the plus side, I think the restaurant has a pretty cool atmosphere for the most part."
1,"Been here a few times and I have to day something. Such care is put into the dishes that's it's hard to ignore. One could say that a pancake is easy to perfect, but that's not true. When a restaurant pays attention to perfect execution of a simple dish, that deserves recognition.\n\nI've eaten several dishes here and most recently had the chilequile. I've never been disappointed with the food or the warmth of the staff. Kudos for bringing such a great little eatery to my downtown neighborhood."
0,"FREAKIN DISGUSTING. I really hope people read this review before they think about reserving a room here. I got a room last minute through priceline.com for 89 dollars on july 4th saturday. I thought it was a steal because of the holiday weekend, but i couldn't have been so wrong. After checking in, our room's trash wasn't even taken out, our complimentary water was half drunk, we had no soap, used towels, and old/used shampoo and conditioner. WTH!?!?!? what kind of hotel leaves there rooms in this condition? i understand that its a holiday weekend and that they're busy, but this is basic housekeeping we're talking about. i never felt so disgusted while i was in the room. \n\ni do enjoy that they have a great shopping area and a decent, but small casino. also, their saving grace was earl of sandwich. great sandwich (the original: roast beef, cheddar, horseradish) after a long hard night of clubbing."
1,Exceeds my expectations.
1,"Update -\n\nFirst trip was a fluke, bad sandwich. I would say steer clear of the patty melt. We have eaten here a few times since and it has been stellar. The custard is out of this world, the kids meals come with a free custard which is a nice touch. I still like the burgers at In N Out better, but I have definitely eaten here quite a bit more than I have there in the past couple of months so that may change."
1,Really tasty sandwiches and queso! They were dog friendly and came over and visited and gave my dog some bacon. Only problem was they didn't give us plates with our queso so we made a mess. I'll be coming back though.
1,"There is was.  Glowing cream metallic linen with some bizarre flower and clover pop-art designs and slash pockets.  It was so strange and unlike anything I usually seen.  I had to have it.  \n\nThis Chloe dress, which probably retailed at LEAST $500 if not way more...was selling at Summerbird consignment in Charlotte for $150!  Seriously?  I was having heart palpitations. \n\nI really enjoyed my experience at Summerbird.  The owner is super high-energy, and the boutique is cozy but packed with excellently edited finds.  \n\nWhile I was there, a woman bought a $2000 denim Louis Vuitton handbag, for, I'm not kidding about $300.  The thing was authentic too (no fakes here.) \n\nThe shopgirls are super friendly, and there's no pressure to buy anything. No pretension, just lots of great finds, and designers, like Trina Turk, Milly, Marc Jacobs, DVF, and more.  I'm adding this to my CLT shop rotation! \n\nPS:  A PRISTINE Versace mini hobo was marked $200. Go now! http://bit.ly/16KFMe4 for pics!"
1,"Delicious green tea latte and tea mulled apple cider. Cozy atmosphere, generally quiet, would recommend for reading or studying and enjoying good tea."
1,"The food here is amazing and the atmosphere is so inviting. Every meal I've had here has been fantastic. Love their pomegranate iced tea. The only problem is they can sometimes be a little slow during lunchtime. They need a little bit speedier service for weekday lunch hours. Other than that, everything is wonderful."
1,"This place is very fun but loud!  You can buy a shot of Jager for a table guest and the must take the shot, then be spanked.  It is quite entertaining.  Don't go here if you are looking to talk to your table guest though!"
1,"The casino is beautiful.  I was surprised on how unique the decor was.  The bright and colorful slot machines have sure changed over the years.  Our room was a great layout and nice.  However, the remote control failed to work and the TV wouldn't turn off preventing us from sleeping.  There is an in room touch pad which also controlled the tv so that was resolved.   The touch pad itself has poor sensitivity.  Some of the lighting flickered uncontrollably and wouldn't turn on/off.  We would hear load popping noises from outside our large window.  I imagined it was the expansion / contraction of the metal shading partitions that went off at various times.  Also, the building seems to have structural problems as many of the doors throughout the hallway were ajar not able to close all the way.  The staff were extremely professional and always greeted us as we passed.  The shower and bath were shared which was unusual."
1,"Went at about lunchtime on a Sunday, and there was only about a five minute wait. This is a busy little place, but seems worth the wait. The biscuits and gravy were very good, and the portions large. They have a nice selection of mini pies and the entire menu is available all day long. The waitress was very attentive and efficient, and the food was delish. I'll be back!"
0,"The bread was mediocre when it should have been mouth watering since it came out warm (so supposedly fresh?). I ordered a calzone with pineapples. The calzone was was huge and there was just a huge slab of cheese inside with canned pineapples inside. The marinara/pizza sauce was on side. When it was warm, the cheese oozed out, but after it cooled, inside was just a slab of solid cheese. Kinda gross. The gnocchi was mushy as opposed to soft and chewy."
0,"SOOOOO Overrated. I have had 2 mediocre dining experiences here. I celebrated my birthday here, and it was sooo gross and ghetto. Bottle service at the club was a total rip off, certainly not worth the 400 bucks.  We had to walk up 3 flights of what was probably the most gross filthy old staircase I've ever seen (in heels!, wtf?). We were seated outside by the bar on these crappy mat-bench things (which were dirty and dusty).  They looked like wrestling mats that you'd see in a high school gymnasium. Also, these gross old hags came over and sat on the bench next to us (they didnt buy a bottle or pay to sit there) and were smoking cigarettes. We had to track down security to ask them to leave. Anyway, the environment was so lame and I was so irritated that I drank waaaay to much (so I wouldn't be aware how badly everything sucked). I blacked out and woke up the next day in my room at the Encore. I was delighted to see that my wallet (and the 3 grand inside it) had been stolen. Being in Vegas with no ID, wonderful, let me tell ya. Needless to say, it was a very disappointing birthday. If you are looking for a special experience, this is not the place. I don't understand why it gets so much press, it's a real dump. Now I know why they have to pay celebs so much to go here.  If they weren't getting paid, they wouldnt be caught dead here.  And as far as sushi goes, if you want an impressive meal, head to Nobu or Sushi Roku (see my review). My next nightclub experience will probably be at XS, it looks waaaay better."
0,"Is this place still open? Their website has been down all week, and no one is returning my messages. We wanted to sign our child up after hearing such good things."
0,"Was not easy to find this place , a cleaning lady at the restroom took us there, the deco was really cool but the pizza is so average and $6 a piece was crazy"
0,"Not a fan. They made us wait for a table even though there were plenty of empty ones (though I realized later that maybe it was because of the waiters:table ratio). I wasn't hungry, so I decided on the half sandwich (Le Parisien) with chicken soup. The soup was good, nice and salty, but the sandwich tasted like an even poorer man's poorboy sandwich. No veggies, just a whole bunch of spiced ham (like salami?) and cheese. The roll that it came on tasted kinda bland too. I think what made it worse was that I am just not a huge fan of salami. I didn't know that's what \""French Ham\"" was. Service wasn't particularly friendly either. I wouldn't say it was horrible in that she wasn't attentive, just the attitude/vibe I got from her was icy. My friend really likes the French Dip sandwich here though. I tried some of the french fries that came with her meal and I do have to say there were pretty good. But I don't think I'll be coming back here."
1,"They have the best Garlic Fries, but I was actually impressed with their Cajun Style Pasta, I did not expect it to be so delicious! Nice beer selection and even on a Busy Fri night, not a long wait for a seat. Definitely a Great Happy Hour spot."
1,"City Vintage is a gorgeous little store that I stumbled across during a wander through Morningside, hidden away on Colinton Road. I was enticed inside by the gorgeous ornate mirrors in the window and I couldn't help but take a peek inside.\n\nInside there are pretty little pigeon holes filled with vintage treasures from retro coca cola merchandise to antique jewellery and home furnishings. You can expect to pay up to around \u00a3200 for one of their big beautiful mirrors, however at the other end of the spending spectrum you will find nice little ribbon tied bunches of lavender for around \u00a31 each and unique and interesting cushions for around \u00a35 each.\n\nThe whole place has a quirky kooky feel that you might expect to find in any vintage store, however it manages to sieve through the tat to bring its customers the very best vintage treasures in this beautiful boutique."
0,"They are immensely incompetent at this location -- as they are at others -- and have no qualms forgetting to conceal it. \n\nIt must be a thing at Walgreens. Yeah, just following S.O.P. here. \n\nThey get the most incompetent, uselessly unhelpful, arrogantly aloof ...\n\nAnd they put those individuals in the photo section. \n\nI came here for my photos, dude.

0,Awful undercooked.  Got the runs from one piece.  Paid $22 for large crappy pizza that got me sick.

0,"Two years ago I gave this location four stars.  Didn't rate my visit last year thinking it was an \""off\"" night.  After yesterday's lunch, I'm certain I won't be back.  There simply isn't any reason - it's just \""so-so\"" and completely unremarkable."
0,"We ate here on July 15, 2014.  This location has slipped and here's why.\n\nHere's a list of everything that went WRONG:\n\n1. The table was not clean when we arrived.  WE had to clean it.\n2. The Long Island Iced Tea was not made correctly.  (I know because I am a bartender.)\n3. The waiter bringing the wine did not know that Chardonnay is white and Malbec is red. \n4. The wait for the wine was over ten minutes.\n5. The loaded potato that we ordered came cold and with the incorrect ingredients on top.\n6. The collards that we ordered were lukewarm.\n7. The filet we ordered as medium well came to the table as medium/medium rare.\n8. The ribs we ordered were dry.\n9. Food presentation was unprofessional.\n10. Finally, the bill was incorrect and we had to find someone to fix it.  We ended up asking the hostess to fix it. \n\nThe only good thing?  The salad.\n\nOther things we noticed: \nThe hostess seemed to be picking up the slack for several waiters.\nA table near us waited 20 minutes before a waiter came, which is unprofessional as there were only four tables in the section with customers and the rest of the restaurant was not busy.\n\nUnfortunately, this restaurant used to be better. \n\nNow, we will not be returning."
0,I have been to pf chang's many times and the food was quite good. Me and my husband went there recently and i feel that their quality has gone down. We ordered vegetable dumplings and it was very bad. We could hardly find any veggies inside. We also ordered vegetable fried rice and it was just average.
1,We haven't been here since they moved to the Belmont location. It was great though and we have missed it! We had a great server (Marin) and enjoyed ourselves. The Greek salad was very good and the kids loved the pizza.
1,"Cool microbrew-pub that felt like your neighbor's garage. Great selection of local and regional microbrews with an innovative, fresh menu to match.  It was noisy but not loud and they have TVs everywhere to watch the game."

1,"I tried Thai food for the first time at this place and I was amazed!!!! The food is so fresh and delicious, I don't want to go anywhere else for Thai food! I'm so glad I discovered this restaurant! The portions they serve you are more than enough, I usually have to take rest of my food to-go to enjoy later! Two thumbs up and 5 stars!!!"
1,I have to say I was surprised how good this place is everyone should try the fries so bomb so different.
0,I would rather eat at Dennys!!! This place was not really good. It was just something to eat cause I was hungry. Kinda bland. . .  !!!
0,"I generally try to stay away writing low ratings, especially when I've only ordered from a place once. That said, the stracciatella gelato (my favorite flavor of gelato) was completely flavorless, and I threw most of it out. Store-bought gelato would have been much better, and maybe they should consider that as an option instead of whatever they're currently doing. My recommendation would be to get a cold coffee or smoothie to sip on while you're walking around, and skip on the gelato. \n\nI'm giving Zio two stars simply because it's the only place I found serving gelato in Vegas. Enjoying good gelato on a hot day is one of life's simple pleasures in my book, and the faux-Italy vibe in Vegas combined with the hot desert sun provides a perfect atmosphere for it. Maybe some of their other flavors taste better, but I'm not likely to try again after my first experience."
1,"This place is SOOO good !! I usually DONT like BBQ but this was good ! I ate everything  on my plate (usually I don't , I pick) .. 4 different sauces to choose from , friendly staff , fast service. I will def be back ! And will recommend to my friends ;)"
1,"This park use to have a ton of peacocks roaming around.  It's so sad to see them gone.\n\nThe grounds are maintained pretty well.  I love how large the park is, there is plenty of space to spread out and play Frisbee, or what have you.  They also have sand volleyball, dog park, soccer fields and baseball fields.  The bbq area is set up perfectly for large parties, I've been to a few here and it's always a great time."
0,"Took Mom and myself to have dinner here after work on Sunday (4/12).  Nice space.  We were given above-average service when we were seated at the robata counter.  (Actually, it's the level of service I expected given the atmosphere of the restaurant.  Anything less would have been suspect.)  When we had to move to the bar in order to take advantage of reverse happy hour, the service level dropped considerably- more on that later.\n\nSince we had arrived around 8:30p, we studied the menus to see what we could try off of the regular sushi options for dinner (the soft-shelled crab) and happily found out that Roka Akor recently started offering, \""on a smaller scale,\"" a few robata apps only to be served on Sundays.  I thought what a nice way to be introduced to the robata menu.  I asked the usual questions regarding allergy concerns and asked how certain items were prepared.  I even handed the bartender , Colin, a list of allergens to hand to the chefs.  (Evidently this list was only going to be looked at once, since many of our dishes had to be corrected after delivery.)\n\nOff of the robata apps menu, I ordered the shrimps ($5) for Mom and the zucchini ($1.50) and the black cod ($5) for us to share.  Off of the regular sushi menu, I ordered the soft-shelled crab roll ($9 for 5 pcs.) for Mom.  The timing of delivery of these items was haphazard.  It took at least 10 minutes before the plate containing two medium-sized shrimp to arrive.  To charge $6 for two grilled shrimp is just ridiculous!  It did smell wonderful and looked appetizing, but Mom wasn't wowed by them- certainly not at $3 per shrimp!  The soft-shelled crab arrived about 5 minutes after the shrimp did and looked great.  Mom found the rice good enough, but she still wasn't feeling any love.  The plate of zucchini arrived roughly about 5 minutes after the crab roll (that's 20 minutes after I ordered!) and held 5 pcs. of seasoned zucchini (salt, pepper, and soy) and a dollop of mustard sauce at one corner of the plate.  Mom liked the one piece she tried, but as much as I tried to get her to try the mustard, she didn't, so I can't report on that aspect.  So here we were, 5 minutes before happy hour was to commence, and all I had to nibble on were the zucchini pieces... Black cod was nowhere to be found.  Correction, Colin the bartender said he spied it at the robata counter, but did not make a move to retrieve it.  I asked Colin if I could give him my happy hour menu selections (all cost $5 each) so that he may have them ready for entry at 9p?  He took my order of Crispy squid and a salmon roll.  I also ordered two Roka Akor burgers, one without the housemade bun, and instead asked for an extra slice of heirloom tomato as a sub.  Would you believe that the crispy squid (again, only for Mom to enjoy bec. the batter contained *!) and the salmon roll (which arrived with **, which I wrote down on the list as two of my allergens- apparently the chefs did not remember, nor did Colin recall to alert the chefs) arrived before the black cod app?  Anyway, the salmon roll was left for my Mom to enjoy while the chef prepared another, allergen-free, for me.  Before I go on, let me say that Mom LOVED the calamari!!  This was the first dish that wowed her, and she exclaimed that this version of calamari is the best she's EVER tasted and even begged for me to forget about my allergy and try them- they were that good!  But I stood my ground.  I found the salmon to be very fresh-tasting and mild-flavored.  The pea-sized miso-mayo garnish that sat atop each piece was so mild, the roll could have been served without these embellishments and no one would know the difference.  I'd say that the black cod (3 pcs.) arrived at least 45 minutes since the time of order.  At least.  Aren't robata items, esp. seafood, supposed to be quick to cook?  I will say that the cod tasted superb, and I'd order them again.  Well, maybe.  $5 for three small pieces is too much, I think.\n\nLast, but not least, to arrive were the beef burgers, one-at-a-time.  Funny, the first burger, which arrived without avocado, but with a bun, so that was quickly returned.  My Mom's burger came, with everything on it, but she didnt' try hers until mine arrived- she was still working on the calamari and the salmon roll.  I liked the beef patty, cooked perfectly to medium rare, although I wished there was more flavor.  Mom's burger looked amazing.  Too bad the lighting at the bar was very minimal (one oil lamp for the both of us until Colin saw me taking photos and lit up another and placed it in front of me, but the fire died down soon after).\n\nI hope to return again to see if the service improves (better memory recall and timing of delivery).  I found the ambivalence showed by Colin of the (greater than 30%) tip I'd given him off-putting.  Factored in the price of the comped salmon roll, PLUS tipped based on the burgers original price of $4 each, too.  Hmm... maybe not too soon a return."
1,"Rhino Market is situated in Wesley Heights right behind Burger Co.  It is a great addition to this area, and if I still lived across the street they would have to name it Michael's Market.  This would be due to me drawing against my 401k to pay my tab every night.  It is comparable to Common Market without all the quirky toys/gifts you can buy.  Their sandwiches are top notch especially the sicilian. Add in great beers on tap and  a more diverse beer to go section and there you have it, Rhino Market."
0,"Blissful Yoga Studio went out of business within several days of me purchasing a five class a package for my mother. Upon contacting the studio-- which never returns phone calls or emails-- on a repetitive amount of occasions, the studio finally agreed to issue a full refund within 48 hours. This assurance and guarantee of reimbursement has yet to be fulfilled after almost 2 weeks.\n\nI have never encountered a business that values its customers in such a manner (not a compliment in the slightest). I will continue to pursue Blissful Yoga Studio until I have received my full refund for the unused five class package I purchased in January. \n\nA completely counter-reproductive, irritating, and surreal experience."
0,"We have been going to Ajo Al's for 10 years. We have always been satisfied with the food, but not today. I usually order either a chicken tostada or a chicken and bean tostada or a bean tostada. Today, I ordered the bean tostado and it was smaller than its ever been. I didn't say anything, but more than likely wouldn't order it again. It seems to be a trend with restaurants right now to reduce their serving sizes. Well, guess what, I won't be frequenting the ones who do. We ordered two cadillac margaritas at $8 apiece. You would think the least we could have expected would have been decent size portions of food. Our total bill was $39 plus tip. No way, Jose. So, if you're looking for an appetizer, the bean tostada is a good choice. If you're looking for a lunch size portion, the bean tostada is not it. Hey, Al, feel free to comment."
0,Not worth it...
1,This place is always packed at lunch... probably because the have great prices on their deal of the day! I just placed my 3rd catering order with Aaron. Their prices are phenomenal for bbq. Dine in when Mary is working the register.... it is a completely different atmosphere when she is off. Call ahead if you know what you want and skip the crazy long line!
1,"I have never loved going to dinner with my mother in law so much. She treated us to Hecho's and everything about the night was perfect. Excellent and attentive service. Spectacular food made exactly how asked for, and delicious appetizers! Any tourists that go through the MGM MUST stop and try it. The rolling guacamole cart (made directly in front of you) is to die for! Just a wonderful night with a full thanks to the Hecho's staff! Can't wait to eat it again!"
1,"Breakfast!!! \n\n It was crazy busy the morning me and another Yelper went to NCounter.  Long line so I was told to order at the bar, still a long wait, actually I think it was longer...therefore just stay in the line.  \n\nI could've eaten the french toast AND Ncounter's Farmer's Market bene (2 eggs poached, spinach, tomato, avocado, hollandaise sauce and potatoes). Delicious!  The Farmer's Market bene that is!  I will have to go back for the french toast.  I also had ordered a mimosa.  More alcohol please next time."
0,"The service was very slow, it took over 30 min for a steak sandwich and the plantains were a joke.  I wouldn't eat there if they gave it to me for free."
0,"The food and service are usually good here. Jarvis, your poor service just lost a customer  tonight. The newcastle is what we usually come here for. Had to ask for napkins, asked the bus boy for a beer refill, no water or milk refills. No utensils for the butter with our bread, gave us the wrong bill for stuff we didn't order. I left a more than generous tip for what service we got. Step up yo game Jarvis or you'll lose more customers for Metro! All on national cheese pizza day and Made sure I showed up late to skip the dinner rush. It is now 8:58 pm you can see the time and day on the receipt."
1,The food is amazing. Fish and chips and the roast beef (with mash potatoes) were insanely good. You MUST try the Yorkshire pudding!!!
1,"Johnny is awesome, the food is great, and at a very reasonable price. I love the homemade chips and the variety of salsas especially the hot stuff. Johnny usually has the food up in two to three minutes and it's fresh and piping hot. I highly recommend this place."

0,"I've been here three times on three separate occasions.\n\nThe first time I was with my parents and two friends for my 21st birthday. The second time I brought a huge bachelorette party of 10+ girls. The last time I was and will ever go there was just with my boyfriend for a romantic dinner.\n\nEach time I've been, the service has been unfriendly, impersonal and slow. Having worked at an upscale restaurant before, I'm really surprised they operate this way on a regular basis. I feel their lack of service is pretty offensive to their high-paying customers. Doesn't matter if you're here on a weekend (the first two times I came here), in the middle of the week (the last time I was here), with a big group or just one other person. The service was consistently bad under every imaginable circumstance.\n\nThe sushi isn't great. During my last dining experience, the rice was actually undercooked in a rainbow roll I ordered-- for three times the price I'd normally pay, a crunchy rainbow roll was not what I was expecting. I also ordered albacore nigiri. It was so small and plain-- not even any garnish. Very sad looking. For the money, I was extremely disappointed. The only dish I did and have consistently enjoyed each time was their crunchy spicy tuna appetizer.\n\nThe desert-- the lava cake-- was underwhelming in flavor. The waiter didn't ask us how our food was or anything about our experience. Maybe they figure you're a tourist and won't be back? Not an attitude I'd think a place like this would adopt. The atmosphere is nice... but thus is the case with a lot of restaurants in Vegas, on the strip. As I recall from the first two times I was there, the drinks are nice-- but again, who has trouble finding a nice drink in Vegas? I wanted some great sushi and a nice dinner with good service in an upscale restaurant! I just couldn't find that here.\n\nI always tip well, but I won't return. After our meal, my boyfriend turned to me and said \""Let's not come back here again\""\n\nI definitely agreed. Enough is enough-- three strikes and you're out!"
0,"Over the years, i have popped in about a 1/2 dzn times.  I keep thinking that somehow it may change, for the better, but that never happens.\n\nNever once have i been made to feel very welcomed.\n\nWines by the retail bottle are over-priced by 20-40% more than what I purchace them for at Phoenix Wines.\n\nIt's too bad they have such expensive wines by the glass and th 'cheese plate' is Ridiculously priced - you can pick out your cheese from the fridge.  (I think a chunk of cheese and some crackers were $17 last time).\n\nIt's a shame because they have a GR8 location & a nice cozy outdoor patio, but I just can't find myself relaxed nor able to enjoy myself when I get fleeced or find it not worth paying these price, esp. when for MUCH less I can go to a hundred other lounges or resorts or up-scale bars for much better service & atmosphere.\n\nSorry guys,but I really did try you - again & again - always to no avail :-("
1,"World Harvest is definitely my favorite import/specialty foods store in C-U. The staff is super friendly, the place is clean, and the prices are generally pretty reasonable. \n\nAnd the cheese...mmmm...the cheese. They have an awesome selection of cheeses, all of which they're happy to let you sample. Most importantly, they have Lurpak (a popular brand of Danish butter). Mmmmmm....butter."
0,"Customer service is a big issue here. Once you walk in you wait for a long time. One customer was getting irritated with them because he kept waiting and not getting his to go order. Some of the customers were just ignored and walked out because they couldn't wait anymore. Quality of their food is decent but the customer service needs to be fixed. When you see multiple people leaving their tables it will hurt your business. I think the biggest problem at this place is leadership and lack of leadership skills. Also waitress should never tell other customers \""oh that guy is mad at me\"", because he waited long time for his order. I just don't think it's professional."
1,"I have been a pt of Dr. Mikel for several years just for my annual care. I just had my 1st baby and can not express how wonderful Dr. Mikel and his staff are. I had a difficult pregnancy, especially during the last 2 months. I was seen 2x a week and Dr. Mikel explained my work situation with his staff. They always got me in on my lunch break, even if they were already booked. Everyone was so compassionate and caring. His medical assistants where there to help comfort me when procedures where done, when my husband could not be there. Dr. Mikel always told me what was going on and did everything he could to ensure a healthy baby for my husband and myself. The hospital care and after care I received from Dr. Mikel was extraordinary. He came everyday I was in the hospital, even though it was his weekend off. I will continue to see Dr. Mikel in the future."
0,"Kind of overrated, although their bakery was good.  We've been to food markets all over the world, from Mt. Hagen in PNG to Tsukiji in Tokyo.  While this place certainly has plenty of fresh produce there was nothing really special about it."
0,"This is the honestly the worst stripclub I have ever attended. I am from New York City and have been to my share of stripclubs in Vegas and NYC. This club has ONE tiny stage and a bunch of fake leater sofas some of which actually had tears in them. The vodka/club soda was ridiculously watered down both times my friend ordered it and they were over $10 each. We saw 4 girls dance on stage and I dont think I saw one actual dance move. \n\nI saw two guys getting lapdances and I dont think I saw one grind move the whole time, it was boring and pathetic.\n\nI will put a disclaimer saying that this was on a Tuesday night so I am sure this wasnt the best they can do but it was a horrible impression."
0,"The spicy chicken and rice I ordered was good but I also ordered a side of fries and it was very stale and cold. It tasted pretty nasty... So my dad went back to ask for another batch of fries and they gave him a beeper, we waited 40 mins only to find out the girl forgot that he asked for some new fries. lol, horrible customer service."
1,"Quick, efficient, and friendly. I had my truck washed and needed the interior shampooed as well and the guys got right on it. The attendant even went over to the detailing guys and told them I was in a rush so they wouldn't dauttle and they didn't. My truck was spotless and they told me if I'm unhappy for any reason I could come back and they'll fix anything they missed. I really appreciate the quick work and their prices are very reasonable compared to Danny's carwash down the street."
0,The pizza was overall ok.  The crust wasn't done enough and was extremely doughy!!  I enjoyed the flavor of the sauce but my daughter thought it had too much sauce on it.  They delivered very quickly (less than 30 minutes for a large pizza) and the price was very reasonable but I would not order from here again.
1,"Every Jimmy John's will get you generally the same quality food, but at this location, these guys are FAST!  It's like they psychically read what you're thinking.  We always joke that your order goes like this:\n\nMe: \""I would like a.. \""\nEmployee: \""HereYouGo\"" (Sandwich handed to you before you finish your sentence)"
1,"Caesars is one of the most beautiful casinos to walk through, you might not actually buy anything here but it is fun to browse and feel like royalty while wandering the endless maze of couture finds and the beautifully gaudy interpretation of an old roman palace.\nI love it- only in Vegas!"
0,"I stayed at San Carlos May 19th - 20th. It was merely \""okay\"".\n\nI liked: \nHistoric old school hollywood feel. It was chic. I dug it. \nThe place had character and I particularly liked the outside of the rooms more than the in. We were in walking distance to the places we wanted to go. \n\nHow about no on these items:\nSurprise! No hotel parking. You can pay the Valet 20 bucks or pay 15 over at chase's parking lot. \nSurprise! They hold an extra $25 on your card in case of room damage. \nGhost lounge? It was Saturday night and the dance floor was empty. It wasn't the plan to go there but it was kind of depressing to see that....\nGhosty goodness? Nope. There was a somewhat weird vibe about the place but nothing really standing out. My house has had more ghosty vibes and action that I received here. \n\nIt has the potential to be pretty awesome but the surprise extra money you end up spending seems like it makes up the difference of what you save.\nI will probably avoid going here again, including the club."
0,"Was next door waiting for my girlfriends doctor appointment when I got hungry so I walked over to this place. Says doors open at 10:30 so I checked my phone and surprisingly it was exactly 10:30, so I reached for the door and it was locked. I decided to wait 5 minutes in the chair outside and watched an employee walk in and lock the door behind him so I left. Needless to say if your establishment opens at 10:30 then be prepared to open at 10:30. They lost my lunch business for today."
0,"Once again, I have a problem with a distinct lack of customer service.\n\nI went to this location and picked out several items of clothing to purchase.  The reason I usually love this store is because I get weekly mailers with discount options to bring in.  Additionally, I had Kohl's Cash on me and a gift card due to a previous return.\n\nI got up to the cash register to pay for my items and the woman was so unpleasant, she couldn't even take the time to smile at me.  The way I figure it is if you hate your job that much...quit.  Especially when you work in a customer service fueled industry like retail.\n\nThe woman finished inputting all of my purchases and I handed her the Kohl's cash I had, which she immediately pointed out was expired.  One rule I've recently found out was that any Kohl's store will honor their Kohl's Cash for up to seven days after the expiration date, which I told her.  She rolled her eyes and called a manager to come over and help her out.\n\nThe manager showed up and fiddled with the keys for a bit before he exasperatedly looked up and me and said...\""look, we can't really honor these things if you don't give them to us until after everything's already been totaled.\""  You are kidding, right?  It's a simple as pasting on a fake smile and asking the customer, \""and, before I ring you up, do you have any savings today?\""  Especially in a store that deals so stringently in savings material.\n\nHe was even more agitated when I asked him to re-ring every item to include our savings.  We ended up with a total saved close to $150.00.  Why would I just eschew that?\n\nThanks for making my decision to go to another Kohl's so much easier."
0,"I order a Korean BBQ dish and It came as a soup.   Nothing mentioning \""soup\"" is in the menu description.   What I can only assume is the manager came out and told me \""it's the same\"".   This knuckle head is trying to convince me that BBQ and soup is the same?\n\nThen another time, I ordered short ribs.   I had to argue with the staff that I was given only bones.  I know Korean short ribs and they had bones on my plate.   If I want more meat per bone ratio, staff actually told me that I had to place another order.  Not acceptable.   They came out with the proper portion after I cancelled my order.  \n\nThe few time I am there, I am greeted by untrained wait staff.   They do not greet and seat you immediately.   They do not bus tables.  They take your order and pretty much forget about you.   I feel the staff hides in the kitchen.   \n\nThey do make a good spicy Glass Noodle dish.   \n\nMusic it too loud.   There were curse words in some of their lyrics they were oblivious to when young children were there.\n\nMaybe my bases of comparison of other Korean restaurants from other states and countries sets higher standards, but I truely feel Soyo is taking advantage of their \""guests\""."
1,"Generally I like this place. The service is great and friendly and the drinks are fairly priced. The sushi can be a bit expensive, but if you go during their super short happy hour you catch a break.\n\nThe pepper on the edamame is really different and good.\n\nOne complaint their happy hour is too short. Considering Goodyear is not some large corporate center, a lot of people have a decent commute home. So a 4-7 would be better. I'd come more often.\n\nAlso nice is they will help to customize your roll and their fish is much fresher than other places.\n\nAnd to the reviewer who commented that no Asians in a sushi restaurant means it's automatically bad is kind of racist and not very helpful. I would also assume you'd skip a doughnut shop because there were no cops there?  Besides, this area is not exactly high on the Asian demographic."
1,Always the place to go to eat before you head back home from vegas :)
0,"HIGHLY DISAPPOINTED! I've ordered from them before and it was pretty good, but their new staff is HORRIBLE! I called to make an order and they put me on hold and hung up. I called two more times to still place my order and they continuously picked up and hung up in me. I know they close at 8, but my order was called in at 7:15. I pray that the owner wises up and fires some of his LAZY employees. I will NEVER go back/call back because of this experience."
1,"Level 107 Lounge is on the 107th floor of the Stratosphere Tower. That's the best thing ... and worst thing ... about Level 107 Lounge. The bar is great because it's near the top of the tallest tower in Las Vegas offering a vast 360 view of the city and dessert ... while it's bad because the Lounge is in the subpar Stratosphere. \n\nIt earns 3-4 stars for a pair of reasons.\n\n** Reason #1: Free\nYou can ride the elevator up to level 107 without purchasing a ticket to the top. Why pay $$ to go to the observation deck on level 109 when you can go to level 107 for free? The Lounge is close to the center of the tower and you can't get next to the windows, but the view is the same Vegas.\n\n** Reason #2: Happy Hour BOGO\nHappy Hour occurs twice per day at Level 107 and serves a limited selection of \""signature\"" cocktails 2-for-1. Early Happy Hour is 4:00 - 7:00 pm and (really) Late Happy Hour is 1:00 - 4:00 am. Each cocktail is $15 and both must be the same. The 10 cocktails available for the special include Lemon Drop, Blue-tini, Cosmic Cucumber, Chocolate Masterpiece, Last Tango, Mango Madness, Summer Mint Margarita, Razz Jito, White Peach Margarita, and Summer Sangria. You can also get some appetizers for half price during the early happy hour.\n\nMy wife and I popped in for some happy hour drinks and to catch sunset. It was easy to get to the top and even easier to order. To see the LV Strip, sit on the side with the Bar. We chose $15 Chocolate Masterpieces with Van Gogh Chocolate Vodka, Godiva Chocolate Liqueur, and White Chocolate Liqueur. Round 2 was two $15 White Peach Margaritas with Sauza Silver Tequila, Peach Schnapps, White Peach Puree, and Sweet & Sour Mix. Both drinks were SUPER sweet as you'd expect with names like that. It was happy hour and I was on vacation with my sweetie, so, I guess it was ok to throw back a few sweet cocktails, too.\n\nNote that it didn't seem \""required\"" that drinks were purchased either, so, I guess you could just go to Level 107 Lounge for the view (I think). Self-parking is free at the Stratosphere.\n\nThe view from the Observation Deck may be better, but instead of spending $18 for the elevator ride to the top, spend $18 ($15 plus tip) on a couple cocktails while enjoying the view relaxing in the Level 107 Lounge."
1,"Lyft is a great alternative to driving. When I plan on having a few drinks, I always use Lyft to get there and safely back home again. Their prices are reasonable and all of their drivers are friendly. Some drivers offer free water, candy, phone chargers, and let you change the radio station. I had a driver once who had baked cookies and they were fresh and delish. I had another driver with a free wifi hotspot in his car. They are usually available around the clock and I usually don't have to wait more than 10 minutes for them to arrive. It's a pleasure to ride in a Lyft. I can't say that about any other form of transportation in Phoenix. (except it's kind of fun to ride the light rail once in a while)\nClean Cars!!! \nGreat Drivers!!! \nGreat Personalities!!! \nGreat Company!!! \nAfter the ride, you get to give your driver a 5 Star Rating."
1,"I said it before and I'll say it again... if you walk into a Chinese restaurant and all of the patrons and servers are Chinese, I would say it's a good sign.  And it was.  This dim sum place reminded me of a famous dim sum place in Hong Kong.  So many options and the servers were around often with the carts so there was no waiting at all.  They had a lot of authentic dim sum.... on the day we went, they had a special duck egg bao.  My friend's Chinese mom was quite pleased.  And those egg tarts... wow! \n\nAnd I've read some of the other reviews about the prices, but I thought the prices were very reasonable.  In fact, there were 6 of us dining and the bill was only $75!!!  Amazing!  And we even ordered a noodle dish off the menu!  \n\nAnd FYI, they don't have their liquor license yet, so BYOB!  We had a little cooler of our own beer and it worked out just great!"
0,"Oh dear this place is just bad.  The meat is bad, the noodles are bad, and the soup is completely terrible.  And it's super pricey.  Stay away!"
0,"I am just now getting around to writing this review almost a year later but the experience I had at this place still sticks out in my mind.  \n\nCame here with a group of girls on a weekday.  We were told it was a big pool party so we got there at 11 am when it opened and waited in line.   We had to wait about 30 minutes while they let in a couple people at a time.  We were expecting it to be super crowded since they were only letting a few in at at a time.  It was super hot (which is fine since it was Las Vegas in June) but the guy at the door kept giving us the run around about why we couldn't just go in.   \n\nWe finally got in and there was absolutely NO ONE in there.   Every bed was completely empty except for two and only a few people were in the lounge chairs and a couple at the bar.    Now we had never been in one of these places so we didn't know we had to pay for a bed.   It was $1000 dollars for the bed which was crazy because there wasn't anyone there.    We did put our stuff down on the bed and were ignored for about 20 minutes until the \""pool director\"" came over and informed us of the price.   My friend negotiated with her and since it was so slow we could have the bed but we would have to buy drinks.  My friend put an order in for 3 $25 dollar drinks and a bucket of 6 waters ($50).   We sat for about 40 more minutes and the drinks never arrived however the ladies that came in after us got their stuff immediately.  \n\nWe were super pissed so we just left but not without letting the waitress know how angry we were.  She played dumb and pretended like she was \""so sorry\"" she forgot.   I don't think they wanted us in there to begin with.  \n\nWe went out of Liquid and over to the regular Aria pool where we had a much better time.  It was very relaxed and the pool was nice."
1,"took the wife there for her b-day sat outside had great service . the goat cheese app we ordered was fab one of the flat breads, a burg that my wife split with a friend i had the meatballs which were 3 huge balls in there very tasty red sauce served with a big piece of toasted rustic bread  we also had the kale salad yes alot of food we had pleanty of takehome"
0,"Wow, we got absolutely terrible service. The only reason that this place is getting more than one star is that the good was great. \n\nWhen we first sat down, I asked about the happy hour specials and was told what they were but that we couldn't get them and would have to pay full price because we were seated inside. I told the hostess three times that I wanted outside as he was bringing us in, but I didn't want to make a fuss about it. We asked to be moved and the girl said that would not be possible, but what we could do is go to the bar. My friend and I went up to the bar to get our happy hour specials while our third friend who doesn't drink waited at the table. While we were getting out drinks three different people came up to my friend who was still at the table asking what the problem was and where we were and what we were doing. They were so rude to her she wanted to leave.\n\nPro-tip: if you offer different prices at different spots in your restaurant people will go for the cheapest.\n\nThe rest of the time the waitress was very rude to us and even ignored me several times when I asked for our check. I don't want to come back here if I can help it."
0,Food was sub par. I ended up ordering a salad after trying my wife's steak. Our server seemed to want to get rid of us from the get go. After we ate and had desert she was no where to be found. Sub. Par.
1,I love Fat Sandwich!  The idea that everything is a topping is a great one so I can get whatever I want and it isn't too expensive. \n\nI loved the Fat Blue and the Fat Cowboy.  if you order a side of fries expect to get about 4 potatoes worth. \n\nYou can also order beer and cigars/cigarettes with your food and they even have a 2 sandwich 6 pack of beer special called the drunken three-way which is a great deal.\n\nbring change for parking though as this establishment is located in the campus town area and you have to pay for everything there.  like they don't gouge the students enough with tuition.
0,"This place is WAYYYY too full of itself and substandard to receive anything more than a single star rating. First off, their ID checkers have the arrogance and attitude of New York club bouncers - Hey fellas, don't flatter yourselves, it's a crappy dive bar (just because you get some low-end Scottsdale yuppies as regulars doesn't mean you're big time, K?). Thought they were bouncing at Studio 54 or something...\n\nNext up, the last two times I lowered my standards and entered this place I GOT NO SERVICE. AT ALL. I stood/sat up at the inside bar for a full 5 mins. once, and like a minute the next time, and said \""Fuck this place. I'm never coming back here\"". Then, when I went to leave, I had to go through a phalanx of overly self-important security goons, and basically told them off. It's kind of a shame, too, because this place is like a 10 min. walk from my house. No, on second thought, it's no shame at all. For me. The shame is on them. \n\nWhatever!"
0,"The last 3 or so times I've visited, they've been closed 15 minutes early.\n\nOn the plus side, I've discovered I look damn good with longer hair."
0,"What a dump!  So sad. I used to love the Flamingo.\n\nOur room was dirty beyond belief: lime scale all over the showerhead (the showerhead ring was hanging off of the wall), a dirty torn shower curtain, a filthy black hole full of dust and grime where the bathroom vent used to be, dust all over the lamps and in the corners of the room, AND our room wasn't cleaned ONCE during our stay despite requesting it from the front desk AND the cleaning staff.  Strange, because there were people cleaning rooms on our floor.  Just not ours, apparently.  \n\nAdditionally, the closet door was broken and one of the outlets had been pushed through the drywall.  Some of the lamps and the clock had been unplugged so we had to do a little work to figure out which outlet was connected to the wall switch so that the clock would work properly.  The TV and a bunch of other things were plugged into a power strip that was shoved into a corner but still fully visible. Classy.\n\nNONE of the speed-dial buttons on our phone worked except for room service (Eventually we were told, \""Yeah, they don't work. Just dial 0.\"")  which is funny because we didn't have a room service menu and had to ask the hotel (on the phone and in person) for one THREE TIMES (over the course of a full day) before they sent one up.\n\nThe hallways outside our room were grimy: filthy stained carpets full of old gum, with bubbles and rolls where they'd gotten stretched out from so much use.\n\nThe elevator doors don't always open (or close) properly. Scary.  Plus, when you push the button for your floor, the light doesn't light.  Oh wait, yes it does but only on the OTHER side of the car.  What?\n\nThe once beautiful flamingo pool and grounds of yore have been mostly removed and replaced with additional buildings and parking.  Instead there is a horrid \""day club\"" pool full of wasted 20-somethings listening to earsplitting crappy music.  The kiddie pool is a little better but its not really separated from the \""Go\"" pool so after 10 am it sucks too.\n\nLest you think I'm just being bitchy, we requested a room change on day two and were told that it could take up to six hours between checking out of one room and receiving another.  Um.  No.  We were very up-front with the management and received a small amount of compensation but the number of people I had to talk to get anything done was just insane and at the end of it, the compensation I was promised was not what was delivered.  Sigh.\n\nClearly whoever owns this property is waiting for it to die so that they can put a giant fake-fancy \""luxury\"" hotel in its place.\n\nIt's really too bad. The Flamingo used to be great.\n\nPS:  The one really good thing about the property is the Center Cut Steak House and bar.  We had a really great meal in the restaurant with excellent service.  Brent at the bar is an actual real bartender (not a typical casino beer slinger) and makes truly delicious drinks while serving up great conversation."
1,"We were nearby and decided to try out Bubba Gump's for dinner.  \n\nThe dining area is located one level up from the entrance filled with memorabilia and gift items.  We were luckily seated in Chad's section for our meal.   He definitely provided great service throughout the evening.  He was fun and very friendly.  \n\nWe started off with the Seafood hush pups that are filled with shrimp and fish.  Since we love hush puppies, this was right up our alley.   Very good with the remoulade dipping sauce.  For my entree I chose Jenny's catch.  This was seared tilapia over mashed potatoes and saut\u00e9ed spinach covered with a lobster butter sauce.   Sounds good right? But it really lacked flavor.  The sauce was very mediocre.    \n\nI tried my husbands meal which was Lt. Dan's Drunken Shrimp.  This was lots of shrimp mixed in with andouille sausage in a bourbon sauce.  This was fantastic.  Spicy and so delicious!\n\nIf it wasn't for Chad, this would probably be rated 3 stars.  But I was so impressed with the service and most of our food, I had to go with 4.  If you are in the area...  try it out!"
1,"Ok. so seriously my car and I have a love hate relationship and I was driving to an even in Gilbert and my coolant is reading beyond normal, so I freak out and go and look for the nearest Autozone. Nice in giving me what I need and nice in helping a girl in distress."
1,"Saw Primanti Brother's on Man Vs. Foods.....\n Amazed by the burger loaded with fries and coleslaw, we had to make it a must stop on our trip to Pittsburgh......\n\nPlace was packed, luckily there were only 2 of us and we found a seat pretty quickly.\nWhat's not to love!? A burger with fries, coleslaw on yummy Italian bread and a cold beer. Delicious! My husband, who hates coleslaw even loved!\n\nThis place seems to be a Pittsburgh staple and we make sure everyone we know who is visiting Pittsburgh goes. If they are confused after our burger description, we have them watch Man Vs. Food, after that they can't wait to try it!\n\nWill definitely be going back ! Unfortunately it will be during football season, hopefully we will get in! Not sure about the Jet fans we will be bringing with us =)"
1,"This was mine and my boyfriends first visit and we had a great experience.  The food, atmosphere, and service were all outstanding.  I will definitely be recommending this restaurant to my friends and you need to ask for Chris Anderson he was outstanding!"
0,I was at the bar playing max bets and got my bill and was charged full price for my drinks?  Nothing comped.  Left as an unhappy customer.You would think blowing a couple hundred buck at video poker would at least comp me a few drinks.  Nope.
1,"Really great personal service. They definitely know what they are doing. The personal service and attention might mean a wait for you, because they give it to all their customers, but it is worth it!"
1,"Great food.  Very generous portions.  I vow to return often.  We ask for mild and it was perfect.  I might get more adventuresome next time, because I like a little heat.  Not so for my husband."
0,"Pho Kinh do...if not for the name, we probably never would have walked into this place.  After having eaten there, I must say that the name is probably the best part about the restaurant.  I love pho for the soup - I like my broth meaty, rich, textured, and so flavorful that you can burp it up hours afterwards and still taste it.  The soup here tastes like someone cracked open a can of beef broth (the kind that's on sale at the supermarket for 55 cents), heated it up slightly, and then dunked some noodles in there.  The soup was lukewarm, and tasted like msg water.  Ironically, even though the soup was not hot, the beef was already fully cooked (if not overcooked) when it came out - it was chewy and tasted like it had been cooked hours ago.  The summer rolls were cheaper than some of the other places we've tried in vegas, but they weren't anything special - the skin on the ends was hard and uncooked on one of my rolls.  As a side note, their banh mi looked interesting (lots of different combinations, including some with egg!) and might be worth a try.\n\nAs for service...we sat down and were not handed menus.  I eventually ended up grabbing the menus myself after unsuccessfully trying to flag down a waitress.  It also took awhile to order, and the food came fast, but that's probably because they hardly heated up the soup at all.  The one thing I will say is that once we finally got our menus and placed our orders, the waitress was very friendly and had a good attitude.  That being said, I don't really care if I have to serve myself at a pho place as long as the broth is slurpy delicious.  \n\nTo summarize: don't come here to eat the pho soup.  It is not anything dac biet."
0,"Horrible - I paid to have my interior vacuumed and wiped down. They did not wipe down the consul or the little cubbies on the door. Everyone that works there is very unprofessional. They all walk around texting on their phones and barely acknowledge you, if at all. I've experienced this at every Danny's I've been too. They charge a pretty hefty fee for sub par work. Guess i'll be looking for a different place to get my car washed!"
1,"Small authentic Mexican restaurant nestled in old town Scottsdale. We sat on the hidden outdoor patio that offers plenty of shade from the merciless Arizona sun.  We arrived around 1130 and the patio was wide open but by noon all the tables were filled with locals and tourists alike.\n\nPrices are very reasonable, around 8-10 bucks each and we enjoyed a couple of great margaritas in the warm Arizona sunshine.  The chicken tacos were good, but the standout was the soft chicken tacos covered in poblano cream sauce - unbelievably good.  We also liked their chips and salsa.\n\nService was a bit uneven but we didn't mind, it was great to escape the winter and just bathe in the warmth."
0,"Go to Sundrops on 40th and Camelback, much nicer atmosphere and competenent staff.  The amenities are poor here.  You are putting your feet in a plain glass bowl (no jets), and it is extremely hard to balance your feet on the technician's knee as chair is low to ground so my legs were shaking as I tried to hold them up.  Treatment was poor, technician didn't slough my heels, or do anything of that nature, and it was still expensive.  The staff is incredibly rude.  They will not apologize for anything, period.  We stood and waited for about 20 minutes to pay our bill.  When they were finally ready, there was no apology and they chanted their mantra \""hey things happen.\""  The blonde woman at the front said this and it was incredibly rude.  We then paid and they stood their silently and took the money and didn't say thank you or goodbye or anything else so we just walked away silently.  It was the extremely bizarre to say the least.  We live right down the street but will never go back!"
0,"Great location right on Blvd St. Laurent with tables right beside the public walk. The service is good and the staff is friendly, but.......... And this is a BIG but.........the food - not so good. \nThe spaghetti with smoked salmon was 'swimming' in sauce and the smoked salmon was lost in the blend. The presentation was un-inspired and the flavour 'muddy'. \nThe burger with blue cheese, burnt bun, un-evenly applied condiments, greasy fries, caesar salad dripping with dressing.\nThe actual patty was obviously some cheap frozen burger, that had alot of water seeping out of it, as well as a strange texture.  \nIn closing, way too expensive for what you receive. \nNever again!"
0,"I came here with friends from work for my \""birthday lunch\"" on July 10, 2014. I am a bit behind on my review writing so I will try to include the highlights, or lowlights as it may be, from my memory. I was eagerly anticipating a spectacular birthday lunch based upon the reviews and the pictures taken. Unfortunately, I was sadly dissapointed and actually left hungry, which is saying a lot for an AYCE place. There were only a couple other tables there at lunch. There was only one waiter which made service incredibly and painfully slow. In anticipation of how long it would take to get our order, as we thought the response time from when we sat down was indicative of the service, we ordered a mass amount of sushi initially - probably 4 orders of nigiri, 4 hand rolls and three cut rolls. There were four of us. Waiter consistently forgot about 1/3 of our orders. My friend must have requested the same hand roll about four times and still didn't get it by the time we left. Also, the specials on the board were not available at lunch - so be careful this was one of the reasons we came were some of the specials. The fish to rice ratio was decent but if they forget 1/3 of your orders I am sure they can afford to cut the rice down on what they serve. The sushi in and of itself was okay, nothing memorable and pretty standard. I would avoid \""the shit\"" despite the accolades provided by other yelpers it was nothing more than a fried mess. After about two hours of fighting through this horrible experience we finally left - we didn't get dessert because we were on \""lunch\"" and were already really late and just couldn't take the agonizing service anymore. It was the perfect storm of forgetful slow waiter, slow sushi chef and being understaffed. I dont' know if the other yelpers came at night and the staff gears it up for the evening but my experience is one I hope to never repeat again in my life. Also, be warned that they didn't provide soda fountain drinks, if you buy a soda it is just a can. Also, the green iced tea is not brewed (despite the representation that it was) and is merely a mix, this was apparent by not only the taste but the mix floating around in the drink. \n\n So so sad that I wasted my birhday lunch here..."
1,"we just stayed for the night. late checkin & wasn't a hassle. very friendly staff & would definitely come back next time i want a nice, quiet & affordable place in downtown vegas. this place is really near to everything."
1,"Liz, Jessica and Tara are the best bartenders.  They are very attentive and make sure you are happy.  I wish every restaurant had even close to the service they provide.  They set a very high bar that has yet to be passed."
1,"I held my company Christmas party here over the weekend and it was a wonderful experience.  \n\nFrom the moment I requested information on holiday parties back in September and was responded to immediately by the Sales Manager, Rebecca; to the moment I walked in for the actual party and was escorted to our private event room the whole experience was efficient, friendly and professional.\n\nOur party went smoothly, the food was delicious, the cocktails (with the exception of the mojito, which seemed to be mixed in an 'unusual' way) were very good, and the servers assigned to us, Jordan and another young man (who's name I didn't catch), were very efficient and friendly.  I will not hesitate to hold another event here.  \n\nI was really very pleased."
1,"Yes it's the best in Phoenix and probably well beyond Arizona, too.  The sausage \""Wise Guy\"" pizza is a national treasure.  We heard a rumor that they bring in the NY water. It starts with the home made materials and the chef does it right. Arrive by 4pm and you'll likely be in the first seating at 5.  Hardest working pizza chef needs a statue built for him.  Highly recommended."
0,"Only reason I ate there was \""kids eat free\"".  The boxed cereal was good.  Kelloggs sure does know how to make their Corn Flakes."
0,"My son and I decided to go to Saddle Ranch before a Coyotes game to grab some appetizers and a beer. After placing our order, the waitress came back and informed me that since there was a Coyotes game, they were not honoring their Happy Hour prices. You're kidding! Let's take advantage of the people coming to Westgate for a sporting event. There are too many choices in Westgate that DO honor Happy Hour to ever return to Saddle Ranch."
1,Superb breakfast. French toast was excellent.  Rest of the table had the daily specials.  They were also impressive.
0,"My fiance and I went to this location for dinner, our receipt lists the time as being 8:42 p.m. He had been to Red Robin a few times, but this was my first, and most likely my last. He hadn't had any problems the times he's been before, but everything about this visit was awful. First, we asked for a booth and we were sat way on the end by a door, and it was only a half booth, the other side were chairs... it felt a bit like being in a hallway. I used the restroom before we ordered, and it was not clean. There were two open stalls, one looked clogged, and the other one I used did not have toilet paper installed. Luckily, there was a wrapped roll elsewhere I grabbed first. One of the sinks was leaking and constantly running and there were paper towels overflowing all on the floor. When I got back we ordered water to drink, which tasted awful. By 2014, I would expect restaurants to know how important it is to people to have filtered water. Fries were brought to our table, but the server did not clear the empty tray, someone else did as they were walking by, and our \""bottomless\"" fries were not refilled. We ordered, and waited. The food seemed to take a long time for what it was, and our server again, was not the one to help us. Someone else brought out our food and our server was nowhere to be found for most of the evening. She did not check in on how the food was, and I had to wait a long time for her to walk by so I could flag her down with a question. I asked if I was served the kids meal of what I ordered - I ordered the battered chicken and shrimp - which came to the table looking dismal, and quite frankly ridiculous. I have a photo I will post. It is a giant plate of fries - as if they are the main part of the entree - and just a few small pieces of chicken and shrimp tossed on to the side as if they are the garnish. It looks laughable in the photo. When I asked if this was the kids meal, she said no it was the adult size, and did not offer to bring out anything else to make it more of a meal. Both my fiance and I were flabbergasted that you would charge $12.99 + tax and tip for this - it was overcooked, the shrimp were rubbery, and quite honestly, I could have bought this at the grocery store for wayyyy less money and made it better myself. My fiance's drink ran empty most of the night, as did his fries. We waited for our check to come, and the only time our server came back quickly to the table was to collect our money and her tip. Overall it was one of the worst eating-out experiences I've ever had... The chicken was half the size of the chicken strips at Applebee's, just an FYI, and they charge about half what you charge... they are double the size there and they serve it with three pieces."
0,"Went to Guedos for the first time today and was really disappointed.  The food was terribly over priced and all normal sides are ala carte to your entree.  Rice and beans are an expensive add-on and are  served in styrofoam dishes.  You have to pay extra for chips and salsa as well.  I spent $20 for a meal that would have been no more than $11 at a  better quality restaurant.  The burro I had was fairly bland and tasteless, the beans were alright but nothing special and the rice not good at all.  I would have enjoyed taco bell much more at 1/3rd the price.  Glad some like this place.  The owner seems like a nice guy, but Imho, the prices and food quality are a deal breaker."
1,"I was finally able to visit the Trilogy this year after hearing so many good things and positive reviews from within the haunt community and from friends with first hand experiences. I am so glad I finally did!\n\nThis is everything that I have missed about haunted houses. I live in Los Angeles, so there's no shortage of haunts in October, but so many of them are pretty big and hire people that say \""boo\"" and want a paycheck rather than hiring people who love it and get it. Freakling only allows a few people in at a time, so you don't have to worry about getting stuck in a conga line and seeing a scare too early. They also treat everyone equal. I'm a tattooed male and in most haunted houses, I get left alone so they can focus on the screaming girl within the group. Freakling doesn't care at all about who you are or if they think they can/can't scare you...they just go for it and it's amazing!\n\nMost people have covered the separate houses in other reviews. I loved them. So many cool effects and illusions that make you go ...WHOA! I was so impressed with all of them.\n\nNow...The Victim Experience. I wanted to try this last year, but couldn't make a trip to Vegas work. I signed up as soon as tickets went on sale for this year. I did it and survived. I can't talk about what happened inside, but I will say that it was one of the most brutal (mentally and physically) experiences I've ever had. After surviving, I felt like I could take on the world. It was such an accomplishment. If you decide that you want to take on the next level of extreme haunt....I wish you the best! If you survive, you will feel amazing and be part of the Freakling family instantly :)"
0,"We ordered Calamari, Ravioli Carbonara and just some simple Chicken Alfredo and paid almost $45.00 for it all.  After trying our food we decided that it is WAY over-priced for the quality of the food.  I was very disappointed because I love authentic Italian food.  Tthe food wasn't bad, there was just absolutely no flavor to judge it by."
1,Awesome tacos!!! Very good margaritas!  Need more?
1,"I love this place! The Meatball sandwich is great and so are all the pastas. Completely authentic and not gross like a cheapy Italian Restaurant.\nEverything is good from the bread, to the meatballs, to the side salad. Order the half portion or full portion of all their menu items and it will not disappoint. Expect to wait a 1/2 or more for your food to arrive though, it will not be done quickly but it will be worth the wait. Call ahead if you are in a hurry! The desserts are also delicious, not to mention it contains a market with a surplus of Italian ingredients to make your own meal at home. Your Italian Grandma would be so proud!"
1,This was an awesome lunch so I'm giving it 4 stars. Maybe it's because the last one we had was the buffet at the bellagio and it was TERRIBLE. But all the food was easy to find the service was great. All the food I tried was hot and flavorful. The desserts were nice and all the food didn't seem like it sat under a lamp for hours. My husband loved the rotisserie chicken and pork. We liked the tamales and it was cheap! 16 bucks a person and if you get the free players card it's 2 dollars off. If your looking for a good Buffet at least for lunch GO HERE!
1,"I think I've discovered a new addiction. I had never tried Firehouse Subs prior to the opening of this location, but boy am I glad I did! As a fan of hot sandwiches, this was the perfect place for me. On my first few visits, I ordered the Turkey Bacon Ranch, and it was delicious. My only wish for it was for the bacon to be \""crispy\"" as it says in its description. On another visit, I had ordered the same thing to go. Same taste, but was a little disappointed in the fact that by the time I got home (10 minutes later), much of my bread had turned a bit soggy due to the dressing they put on it. Maybe next time I should ask for the dressing on the side. \n\nIn an attempt to branch out and try another sub, I ordered the New York Steamer Sub (hehe). Again, YUM-O! The meats on their subs are definitely not sparse, as they pile their meat on a lot more than the bigger sub sandwich chains in town (ubway-Say and ort-of-subs-Pay) :D.  Also, their meats are very juicy! Any time you can describe something as meaty and juicy is GREAT in my book! ;)\n\nOh, and any place that is equipped with the soda machine that they have, has automatic brownie points from me! 120+ flavors of beverages out of one machine?! My only desire was to have the ability to sample each flavor in one sitting! I absolutely love the Peach Sprite. Mmmmm...\n\nClosest thing to Earl of Sandwich in my opinion, and definitely more bang for your buck."
0,"Just plain jane nothing special on the Jampbong and Jajangmyun.  Gampoongi and tangsuyuk were so so.  The beef gampoongi had a weird after taste which I could not figure out, but then I wondered why am I trying to figure out a weird after taste.\n\nAll in all nothing special.  Most of the cooks in the food court are latino so I'm sure the food may be biased towards their local tastes.\n\nBig MeH"
1,"If you're looking for a bookstore that embodies Madison, Paul's is it. \n\nI do like rambling bookstores with nooks and crannies, but Paul's stands out for needing a thorough cleaning. It's extremely dusty -- and that's without any car traffic on State St. A few of the sections could also use a purge and freshening. Still, the store had a nice vibe, with NPR blaring, people wandering in and out to say hi to staff and owners, and lots of wastrels killing time between coffees."
0,I love crawfish and I was so disappointed coming here. The crawfish was so small I can barely get any meat out. We also had oyster the size of a quarter. Will I come back? No. I rather go to razzoo's Cajun cafe.
1,"i'm not a big noodle person but i had to try this place after reading a number of articles on it.  I got the seafood pasta and the bf got a beef stir fry. We also got a small plate of fresh veggies and pig ear. The food was fast, tasty, and cheap. I was a little disappointed with the seafood pasta dish in that it seemed to just be some corn, shrimp, and crab meat in alfredo sauce but that was more my fault on picking the wrong dish. \n\nThe noodles were soft and tender. You can also watch the guy match the noodles too. The small dishes or veggies and pig ear taht we got was a lot more than what I was expecting. I also liked that they give you a small dish of peanuts and radish. Overall the food was cheap and tasty which is what I like and look for."
0,"Meh. Small, dry, unflavorful burgers. Even in our drunken, starving state after a night of partying, it STILL didn't satisfy me. The patties tasted almost previously-frozen... The sweet potato fries that everyone was raving about on here wasn't very good either -- cold, dry, and just not very appetizing. After having some amazingly good burgers earlier in the week, this just disappointed me greatly."
0,Ehh this place was just ok. Service was kinda slow. The salsa that comes with the chips is HOT! Food was mediocre. We wouldn't come back...only came here bc IKEA is across the street. We've been waiting for our server to take our check now for a good 21 minutes!!! It also didn't help that I got bit/stung by something while sitting outside on the patio that caused my foot to itch and burn something awful!! \nNote to management: you may want to spray out on patio if you don't already...
1,Had the Pulled Pork with sweet potato fries. Very good and only $10.95! You won't be disappointed!!
1,"I don't know why there are negative reviews of this hotel. As a matter of fact, the next time I go to Vegas I'm staying here again.\n\nThis hotel is far away from the overbuilt part of the Vegas strip where you'll find your typical Vegas hotels like Wynn, Venetian, Ceasar's, Cosmopolitan etc. It's secluded and it's also more of a boutique hotel. However, if you feel like visiting the other hotels there is a monorail station built in the backlot of the SLS. You can buy an all day access pass for only $12. But I'm warning you. Once you step foot on the more populated area of the LV strip you'll notice a drop in class. You'll want to head right back to your safe haven.\n\nNow, about the hotel. I noticed that the service was excellent. Everyone who works at the SLS must have gone through quality training. The staff was polite and friendly. For once I didn't feel like a walking dollar sign. \nThe casino is pretty small but I liked it. The restaurants range from casual breakfast, lunch to formal dining. I went to Katsuya, Cleo, Umami Burger, and The Griddle. I highly recommend the first two for dinner. Also the rooms are modern and sleek. I stayed in the world superior King room. It has two giant mirrors with built in lighting which are across each other on opposite sides of the wall, a king bed, and a decent sized bathroom. The bed is really comfortable btw.\n\nI also had time to go to the gym. It's a small gym but it has everything you need for a decent workout. No squat racks or bench press but there are free weights.\n\nThe foxtail pool is modern and sleek as well. The servers were very attentive and friendly. \n\nTo sum it up. If you've had enough of the overcrowded, trashy, rude, crappy service Las Vegas experience and you're looking for something classier then I recommend the SLS. If you want to spend your money in a BIG hotel with BAD attitude then stay somewhere on the populated section of the strip."
0,good store
1,"I just took my wife and daughter to Mimi's. If you like REAL New England clam chowder then look no further than this place. They only serve it (sniff) on Fridays. It is rich, creamy, and full of big chunks of fresh clams. Couple that with a full menu of great lunchtime or dinnertime treats and you'll come away satisfied. The service was impeccable. The staff was very friendly and they work together as a real team to give their patrons a truly memorable experience. Love it love it love it! The muffins are great and when they found out my daughter hadn't been there before they gave her four muffins to take home with her absolutely gratis. I had the Cobb salad which never disappoints. My wife ordered off the two course special menu and got asparagus with citrus shrimp. My daughter had the salmon. Everyone raved about how good everything was. The food, the service, and the ambience is great. Two thumbs up...way up!"
0,"I LIVE upstairs at and within CityCenter!  DO NOT go here!  I call down for a simple take out---yes...a service they say they provide....yet we were refused service!  All we requested was for two simple rolls, yet their manager decided that they were too busy to provide service to a regular customer who is an MGM M-Life Platinum Member!!!!  Loved their food and service....before....now, I regret ever tipping so generously and they will NEVER GET MY BUSINESS AGAIN!!!!!!!!!!"
0,I had purchased a manicure on Groupon for Mandy. My appointment was scheduled a week in advance and the appointment time was for 8:30am. I knew I was going to be 5-10 minutes late so I texted Mandy to let her know and she responded that she could not see me anymore and that she didn't have time for me. Well that kind of threw me off because I was already on my way and I was only late because my daughter was running late (she's only five)! Well I showed up and I was actually SIX minutes late! Mandy however was not there and told me sorry that she could not see me and that I would have to reschedule! This groupon was given as a gift to me for my birthday which was three days before. I was going out of town the day of the appointment and I didn't have time to get it done before my birthday! I know I was late but 6 minutes seems a little ridiculous. Is this really how you treat a customer? I was extremely disappointed with the situation! I don't believe this was appropriate given the amount of time I was late. I still don't understand and can't believe this happened!
1,"I've tried two other nail salons in the area, and I was utterly disappointed with both.  Embellish Nails, however, is wonderful!  Friendly techs who listen to what you want and make excellent suggestions.  I was stunned by how quickly and thoroughly they did my gel nails...and they turned out perfect!  I've never seen a nail salon with so many color choices.\n\nThe place is clean and well-decorated and relaxing.  I've finally found \""my\"" nail place...can't wait to go back!"
0,Not very organized. I'm glad I arrived 2 hours early because you know what might happen. It's a small airport but gets the job done. We don't need a palace of an airport just to catch a plane. LOL
0,"Terrible service and extremely inattentive waitress that I had to curse out. I left without ordering anything. Manager could also care less. They were both blondes so go figure. I went across the street to Kelly 's where the food, service, and atmosphere was amazing and welcome. The bartender got a $30 tip."
1,HOB #1 Gilbert Brew/Pub/Restaurant! \nAsk for Forrest he's smaat( Boston smart)\nNice and a GREAT WERKER! \nWe will see all y'all soon KDS
0,"A local dive that opened in 1985.\n\nDark, dingy, and more than a bit *used* - but with friendly bartenders and a fascinating clientele. \n\nOn my first visit,  I met a computer animator, a former lounge musician, and a lady who was taking a break from her work on the street. She was accompanied by a gentleman friend who seemed to be some sort of boss/handler. Anyway, she fit right in with the *used* vibe.\n\nNo fancy drinks or interesting beers. The restaurant was not open when I visited.\n\nOne star for the friendly folks, another for just hangin in there."
1,"Best new ballpark in MLB!!!  Took a tour on Monday, June 6th at 2PM.  Our tour guide was very informative, helpful, and nice.  Couldn't have asked for a better experience.  The team might not be great, but this ballpark is a MUST-SEE!!!!!"
1,"Their chocolate at their shop is very expensive!! \n\nI know this sounds strange but I absolutely love their Caesar Salad. It has a creamy Mexican infused flavor dressing and the chicken is super moist and tender. It is a very satifying portion and great as an entree. \n\nThe Mac & cheese is pretty good too, you don't get to decide what goes in it but I would recommend they turn this place into a Mac&cheese/chocolate bar. \n\nThe churro chocolate fondue was delicious, I literally wanted to lick all leftover dark chocolate!! \n\nPlenty of creative chocolate desserts for choco-lovers and it is a great place for a break after all that shopping. It's located right across from H&M.\n\nWe arrived 30mins before their closing time and they were very patient without lack of any details. \n\nI will return next time!!"
1,"Good food, but portion sizes don't make much sense.  We ordered a half of the sampler appetizer, which was HUGE!  It was also very delicous.\n\nWe had also ordered a sandwich to share, and we were disappointed with the size of the sandwich.  Overall, everything tasted good, though nothing truly to write home about."
1,"In theory, I LOVE Marquee... in reality, not so much.\n\nTHE GOOD (3 stars): The club is huge with 3 floors, each housing their own genre of music. It's a beautiful space, without a doubt. There's an inside and outside to cool down when it gets too hot inside, there are great views of the strip outside, and everyone is dressed to the nines because it's a tier-1 club in Vegas. There's world-class talent multiple nights a week spinning here, but if you're not an EDM kind of person, there's also a hip hop floor and top 40. That being said...\n\nTHE BAD (2 stars): What kind of idiotic structural designer made a club where girls need to walk up/down 5 flights of stairs to get in? That part NEVER made sense to me. I love my leg workouts, but hobbling down 5 stories in 5 inch heels after a night of dancing gets... well, it gets fucking annoying. To get from one floor to the other is a massive shitshow when you're drunk, and the layout of the club makes it impossible to find anyone. I found the nightclub to be a nightmare to navigate every single time I've come here. The circular, labyrinth layout makes it easier to find Waldo in a sea of patriotic colors than a damn bathroom to relieve myself in because the club looks the same from every angle (the stairs too, which really doesn't help when you're trying to figure out which floor you're on). And you'd think that, for a club inside the Cosmo and with so much clout and real estate space, they've make a bigger main dancefloor. If you're not on the main dancefloor by 11PM, you're not getting on it for the rest of the night unless you tip the bouncer a 50.\n\nTHE OTHER GOOD (that I re-added a star for): SECRET PIZZA. This amazing pizzeria is inside the Cosmo and when you see everyone exiting Marquee and making their way there, follow them! It's got to be the best drunk food I've ever had.\n\nMarquee was one of those clubs I wanted to love because the concept is great (multiple floors, inside/outside, great DJs, different genres, good-looking crowd, etc.) but couldn't because some designer totally cut out the practical aspect of his work. I can usually only stand being here for an hour or two before heading over to Wynn and Encore to finish my night. Anyways...\n\nDAYCLUB (that got another star): In my opinion, a lot better than the nightclub part of Marquee. There's less people, the heat gets you drunk faster, everyone looks their best in the summer, servers are friendly, and it's not insanely hard to get a drink. I was front and center for Dash Berlin when he played here. I still think Encore Beach club is more fun, but Marquee is definitely among the best dayclubs you can go to in Vegas."
1,Great selction.  Informative Staff.  LOTSA inventory!
0,"The ice cream Sunday I got was tasty but the service was poor.  They were out of vanilla, the cash register wasn't working and I got the feeling that the cashier didn't want to help me."
0,"Service was terrible. They never offered us any water.  When ordering for food, they barely helped us out and were being snobby when they were describing the dishes.  After ordering, food took a long time to come.  The hostess came by and helped us take pictures while we waited for food. She was the only person that was nice and courteous at the restaurant. She's the only reason why the restaurant would get +1 star.\n\nWhen the food came the waiter had no idea who to serve the dishes to.  After we finally got all the dishes on the table, the waiters never came by to ask how we were or asked if we needed anything else.  \n\nWhile we were there, the waiter brought over forks and dropped the fork; ok no big deal.  Soon after when they brought over the bread, again he dropped it, this time on one of my friend's lap. The waiter then asked, \""you don't want it? Since it only touched you, you don't want it?\"" He takes the bread into the restaurant, comes back with a dish and a bread on it.  As he placed the dish on the table, he said \""I just put the same bread on a plate, you won't even know, and now you'll take it.\""\n\nBy the end of the night, we haven't thought much about the lack of attention the servers had shown, but it soon became really obvious that they had been neglecting our table.  As soon as we asked for the check, the waiter was hovering over our table while we were examining the check, the ENTIRE TIME.  When we finally decided how much tip to pay and placed the payment by the check, the waiter rushed over and picked up the cash right in front of us and counted the money in our face.  Never in our lives, have we ever seen such rude customer service provided.\n\nTo top off the terrible experience, their food was bland, tasteless, and extremely over priced for very little food on the plate.  A 6 oz steak 1 glass of wine, came out be around 50$ excluding tips.\n\nCompletely not worth it in any way shape or form."
0,"Never coming back here. The ac in our van has gone out more than once and hasn't been fixed properly yet, we were here a month ago and they said it was fixed.  Also, we need new o2 sensors and they are overcharging me to fix it.  They told me around $550 for two to be installed, I found them quite cheap on the private market and was able to get them installed quite easily.  Each o2 sensor was about $67 and was installed in less than ten minutes."
1,ANOTHER ALTERNATIVE TO PURE NIGHTCLUB\n\nI came here 2 years ago in November 2011. This is right across from Old Homestead Steakhouse. I describe this place as quaint. That's a perfect description to this nightclub/ bar. Personally I like the decor here than at Pure. There's an intimate vibe that you feel here than at Pure. The dance floor is extremely small. The crowd tends to be older while the younger crowd (21-25 years of age) goes to Pure. Occasionally you'll see some younger crowd here to buy drinks. That's what is cool you get a mixture of old and young without the weird vibe of seeing older people at Pure. The music played is Top 40. The best part of The Gossy Room is from what I observed that you don't pay an entrance fee for the dance floor. The only thing you pay for are the drinks at bar. So if you go to Pure you can come here for a while and then go back to Pure. After dinner at Old Homestead Steakhouse you can come here for drinks and to dance. If you decide that you don't want to go to Pure because of the big crowd you can have a great nightclub time here. Surprisingly The Gossy Room is a hidden gem and because of it the one quality that The Gossy Room has is character. I thought what kind of character that brings a mixture of younger and older crowd to this place. There is a Mad Men appeal at The Gossy Room.
1,"a very good place if u just wanna chill, the atmosphere has a calm and relaxing mood to it.  the food is good, though the wait is a little long, but its well worth it.  the bar area is cheap, and the workers are very friendly and easy to talk with.  highly recommend everyone to try it.  also a very good place for lunch and its awesome that the place is open till 2 everyday and the sushi bar is also open till than.  So for those of you who crave for some sushi at 1 am Sake Tini is the spot to go."
0,"Since I moved to Vegas, the appeal Foundation Room has been steadily declining to the point where I no longer have any interest in going.  The music is stale, the crowd is older, and the vibe is nothing special (and by nothing special, I mean a rip-off of Tao). Even though Foundation Room is no longer a members/invite only establishment, they still like to take advantage of that reputation to bring nightlight novices through the doors.  This place has also been known to shut down rather unexpectedly at 2am if they are slow, so if you're coming here expecting an all night party, you might end up leaving early and disappointed.  The highlight is definitely the view, which is one of the better views in Vegas (perhaps second only to Mandarin Bar).\n\nIf you're new to the Vegas nightlife scene and can get in for free, you'll probably have plenty of fun here; however, like many of the smaller clubs and lounges in Vegas, you'll most likely be a bit disappointed after experiencing some of the bigger, flashier clubs/lounges that Vegas has to offer."
0,"I will never, ever order from here again.\n\nI picked this place based on the Yelp reviews through EAT24.  I ordered the large pizza with fingers, an appetizer sampler, and fries.  I always complete my online purchases through Google Wallet and do so with this.  Order submitted at 8:11pm, 45 minute delivery time.\n\nI get a call at 8:40pm from a guy saying he needs my credit card number, I explain I already paid through Google Wallet when persists that he still needs my number.  I give him the number and again state I've already paid when he says ok, I just needed the number, they should have the food out in 40 minutes.  40 minutes?  But I ordered half an hour ago?!  Oh you did?  Food is almost done the driver will be out soon.\n\nI contact EAT24 because the card thing doesn't sit well with me.  After 20 minutes of negotiating with this place they realize I was being charged AGAIN even after I made sure and said I already paid.  The lady at EAT24 tells me they are refunding me and just confirmed it will be another 45 minutes.\n\nTen minutes later, I get another call this time telling me they're out of fingers but instead of five fingers they'll give me 12 wings for the inconvenience.  Here's the thing, the deal comes with either five fingers or 12 wings, they're not doing any favors.  When I start to say I don't even want this anymore because of the extreme lateness, being double charged, and them not having fingers, she says she'll throw in a two liter for the inconvenience.  Whatever.\n\nFood gets here: pizza is cold, chicken is ridiculously dry, appetizers are burnt (all except for the mushrooms which I can't eat).  The only thing that tastes good, not just barely edible, are the fries.  I waited two hours for some of the worst delivery in my life.  Fantastic."
0,"For our first meal in Vegas we thought we'd try Diablo's as it was one of the places in our hotel, the Monte Carlo Resort. There were 4 of us, 2 couples. Upon finding the first \""hostess\"" she pointed us outside to the \""other hostess.\"" Between the two of them they passed us back and forth before the \""outside\"" girl finally put us next in line for a table, approx. 10-15 minutes. We noticed a table for 4 empty, so we figured we'd be seated soon. Next thing we know, a group of 6 and then after that a couple came into the restaurant and were seated right away, while we were still holding onto the pager waiting our turn. It was at that point that we left, it was clear that they were discriminating against us, either because they could tell we were lesbians or we were not \""girly\"" enough or didn't have men on our arms. Get over it, it's 2012. After reading the reviews we are thankful we didn't eat there. We had much better fare over at the Sporting House Bar & Grill."
1,"I Love this place! Its around the corner from my house and reminds me of the dive bars in San Diego. \nTheir happy hour is really cheap and they do karaoke every night, which my roommate loves. I could pass on that part.\nthey also do trivia night and play every major league game usually. \ndefinitely a spot to check out if you're in the area. Good for after dinner drinks, or as a meeting spot after work.\nThe people that come here are all very social and everyone seems down to earth. \nTheir sliders are good but a little on the greasy side (buns covered in oil), but their tacos are to die for.\nThey have two pool tables and video game machines, so you don't have to just sit around and drink, except that's what I like to do. Hahhaa will definitely be back."
0,"I've appreciate simple - I don't value sloppy\n\nAtmosphere: A sports pub through and through.  Lot's of various sports teams' paraphernalia, banners, and posters.  The seating is spartan (watch out for loosely assembled chairs).  This place looks like it's been through the wringer (quite a few times) and seemingly never has a chance to recover from it's hangover.\n\nService: No one notices when its happy hour and the pitchers of beers are being passed around, but the service is sloppy, unprofessional, and meagre at best. \n\nFood: Bad - even by pub standards.  Often the taste of the uncleaned grill lingers on the food.  Don't try the coffee (unless you want to use it as a laxative!)\n\ngo elsewhere"
0,"I would have given this place 3 stars based on a handful of visits, cool decor and some interesting swing-seats. It seems like a good place for a date, although from what I remember it was a bit pricey.\n\nI've thought about returning, until I heard that the bar management thinks jokes about domestic abuse are a good way to sell drinks and bring in business. Now I KNOW there is no need for me to return. Sexism and misogyny are bad for business."
0,"Don't waste your time or money on the Monorail! It's overpriced and overall a bad value. The hotel I was trying to get to - Wynn - stopped running a shuttle to the convention center station and the automated voice waited until we got there to announce that and say that we now have to backtrack to an earlier station. That wouldn't be so bad if it wasn't for the fact that the stations are NOT air conditioned and trains take way too long to show up. At MGM, you're left standing in the blistering heat while you wait for the southbound train to go down towards the airport just to invert itself and turn around. Most logical train systems just kick it in reverse, go the other way, and use a switch to get to the other track. \n\nAnyway, it's not worth $5 per ride to do it. The SDX and DEUCE buses run by the county are way better. $8 for unlimited rides for 24 hours and the SDX runs every 3 minutes or so, and they enclose the driver in a soundproof box so he can focus on driving and swish around traffic, getting you exactly where you need in record time."
1,newly remodeled. lots of parking! Also known as county.
0,"I wanted to write a review concerning a recent visit I had at this pet clinic.  I will say something positive to start...They were one of the few vets in town who could fit us in during the morning hours for an emergency situation.   Though they have very knowledgeable and helpful staff...their prices are almost double what some of the other vets charge for similar services.  Our pet had to be euthanized...we paid $186 for the shot  to put the dog to sleep and over $100 for cremation and burial.  I spoke to the crematorium to find out where they bury the dogs they cremate, turns out the ashes end up at the local landfill...we later discovered that Maricopa Animal Control will humanely euthanize an animal for $60...and the dog's remains would end up at the same place I was charged to bury the dog through the vet clinic.   Just thought I could save the next family some money...if you end up having to put your dog to sleep."
0,"THIS PLACE BLOWS GOATS!\n\nOn my recent trip to Vegas we were starvin like marvin and found this joint inside Caesar's. We looked at the menu and decided to eat there because the prices were decent and we were ready to consume a cow.\n\nThat was the biggest mistake of the night.\n\nTalk about horrible everything.\n\n1. The food here is not fabulous by any standards and you're going to pay more than you would at any other hotel cafe. 15 dollars for a measly quesadilla WITHOUT chicken.\n\n2. The WORST customer service I have had in a long time. We spent exactly 2 hours here because they never brought us our check and it took almost an hour to get our food which was 2 salads and a quesadilla. \n\n3. They double charged my credit card and I had to call them once I got back to California. They fixed the problem two days later.\n\nMaybe I caught them on a bad night, but c'mon! That wasted most of our first night there. We ended up at this other crappy place for drinks later. Thanks a lot Augustus Cafe-FOR NOTHING!"
1,HATE  Nothing.\n\nDISLIKE  Only location is far away from where I live. Out of a few items including the cronut. The way the donuts are packed in the box messes up the frosting/toppings of some of the gourmet ones.\n\nLIKE  The friendly cashier and manager. The date with a nutty pig. The reasonable prices. The other imaginative donut creations.\n\nLOVE  The strawberry shortcake. The apple fritter.
0,"Such a disappointment. Got hooked up with a Host by the name of JOSH. We were promised a VIP table by a Marble Fire Place and were told instead of being stuck paying for bottle service for cheap Vodka we would have a $350 drink Minimum so we could order whatever we wanted. I thought we were being hooked up because my husband was a Total Rewards Diamond card holder. You would think that gambling 75k at their Casino would get you some special treatment.\u00a0\nWhen we got there our name was on the list for a table. But just the standard $350 for a table and a bottle of crap Stoli and a \""free\"" crap Champagne.\u00a0 It was Friday the 17th and it was so dead the inside club was closed and only the terrace was open. Keep treating customers like they are irrelevant and lying to them, its no wonder you can't fill up your club on a Friday. We went to the Bank at Bellagio the night before and on a Thursday it was even more crowded then here.\u00a0\nSo we took the table for $350 with Stoli and the final bill was $512. For service charge, gratuity, other unknown charges and water.\u00a0\n\n\nOnce I got over the initial irritation of being lied to by JOSH, just to get us to their club I made the most of it. The DJ was great, tho supposedly he doesn't take requests its against policy. Music was 98% Hip Hop and Radio music which I loved.\u00a0\n\n\nWaitress was TERRIBLE and she did not receive an \""additional\"" tip from us. But the table attendant did. He was great he was very attentive and security did let us know they would escort ladies to the bathroom.\n\nI read other reviews complaining about booth size. I thought it fit 4 people perfectly. But then they sat a group of 6 guys next to us. Umm at a 4 person bench... 2 had to stand.\u00a0\n\nAlso read complaints about the look of other patrons. I saw mostly 30's some younger, a few older. I don't mind I am not too good to party with fat chicks or old dudes I will party with anyone who wants to have fun.\n\nI live in San Diego so we visit often. I cannot think of a reason why I would want to visit this club again unless I just went general admission. I can take my $500 elsewhere."
1,They warn their food is highly addictive and they're not joking!\n\nI usually get the Teriyaki Chicken / Spicy Chicken Plate with steamed white rice and macaroni salad.\n\nI've been eating here for the past 2 years and I've never had a single time when I was disappointed with their food.
0,"Management of this property pick and chose what items of their lease agreement they want to uphold.  If it involves charging tenants more money, they will enforce something; however if it doesn't monitarily benefit them, forget about it.  On the south side of the complex, you have to fight for a covered parking space.  The lease agreement states one COVERED parking space per unit, but is not enforced.  There are multiple violations of dog breed restrictions, satellite dishes hung from areas NOT authorized in the lease agreement, and people storing stuff on their balconies.  Compare the common area outside the models to those of the residents and you'll see a big differece.  The stairwells are dirty and dusty and the bushes/landscaping are .  They claim there are bbq's throughout the grounds, however, there were several times I'd have my meal prepared to grill and could not find a working grill.  The pools were kept fairly clean, but the decking, chairs and tables were rarely, if ever, cleaned.  If you get an apartment by either of the pools, be prepared for alot of noise and late into the night.  The only recourse you will have is the local police department.  The gym is decent and basically well-maintained.  Overall the complex is decent, but definitely overpriced.  You could get so much more in a larger house with a garage for the same price or less."
1,"Location wise is perfectly situated right by Regal Cinemas in Village Square! Conveniently accessible for those hunger cures before of after a movie.  For those unfamiliar...Archi's Thai Cafe may seem like another Asian/American Fusion like PF Changs...or pick up stiX...but in fact when one takes a closer look, 100% Authentic Thai is clearly shown.  Try and behold for this is true.  Upon first walking in, the restaurant feels small, but the wooden shutters, and wooden tables and chairs balances this out and gives you a good feel of solidity to its decor.  This is not your usual Asian themed furniture but don't let this fool you, for the food is as good as it gets.  \n\nWaiters will take your order and ask you from a level of 1-10 how spicy you would like your food to be, and plenty enough to satisfy all types of taste buds and spice level to handle.  Tom Kha may not be for everyone but It is a great little soup starter like won ton soup for Chinese food.  Price could be cheaper, but the quantity of food is decent enough and good enough for the price.  I don't know if your typical person would go everyday, but nice to have once in a while.  Thai food is comparable to Pin Kaow or Lotus of Siam\n\nArchi's is clean and food comes out at a respectable time frame. A little advice tho, get there before 6pm or off times because after 6pm the restaurant starts to get busy and picks up a lot of customers...you may have a line out the door or wait.  Others must think it is good though to keep coming back for more.  Give it a try...It is pretty good."
0,"Yes, its a beautiful, architectually designed hotel that is so over the top that you have to use a damn remote control to close the curtains.\nThe SIMPLE things and ammenties do not exisit! I stayed in the Sky Suite. The room itself was clean, the bed was very comfy, but when it came to just basic stuff, it just pissed me off. I wanted to listen to music on an ipod or a radio. Not happening, you have to press 20 buttons on the remote and still no chance you will get what you want. They wanted to make it \""green\"" apparently, but I wasn't diggin on it.  \n\n I ate at a Cafe there, don't remember the name, but the service was excellent, food was cooked to perfection and yes it was pricey but expected. \n\nDefinitly get your car valet parked.\n\nThe entrance and getting to your room is NOT convenient at all. You have to walk 6-7 minutes just from the strip to get to the entrance of the hotel, then another 10 minutes walking thru the casino with your suitcase and crap to get to your room which the elevators are located in the back! It sucks!! Of course, they have it laid out that way on purpose, to get you suckered in to throwing some $ down on the slots, etc. But , its a pain in the ass to haul everything, especially on your last day, when all you want is OUT of there."
0,"A neighbor recommended Franks all about time and so I took him a wall clock which he fixed well and it worked fine.  I did take him an unreasonable amount of time to do the work though.\nIn October I brought him another clock.  This one had only hands that flopped around although the clock ran well.  About 3 weeks later, I received a call saying it was gonna' cost this much and he'd have it ready the week after thanksgiving.  Bear in mind that he had from October to late November to inspect it, repair it, etc.  Anyway, two and a half weeks after Thanksgiving I called to find out when I could pick up the clock not having heard otherwise from him.  I was then told that although the clock hands probably needed replacement, he had gone into the clock works and now it doesn't work.  Would need a complete overhaul  to the tune of 400$ and would take him 10 MONTHS to get around to starting repair.  \nIf you have a lot of time to wait and a lot of money to spend this is the place to go."
0,"This one has never been the place to go if you want to experience good customer service, but its the closest to us and unfortunately the kids like it. \nBut our trip yesterday but a end to it. We took the kids and after a painful ordering time with a very rude cashier we go to find a nice big hair in our cheeseburger (and defiantly wasn't one of ours) we took the uneaten cheeseburger to the manager which she didn't even apologize for it, in fact she didn't say anything until my husband ask if we can get the money back for the cheeseburger and she then said yes."
1,"Honestly its not a Boiling Crab! But thats why its called Angry Crab Shack, people honestly this is one of the Best Seafood Places to come to Arizona! If you dont like it the feel free to enjoy the 400 mile ride to Cali honestly! At least some Genius finally brought this out to us, and we talked with him and all of his fish is shipped fresh then frozen at the most a day.....sooo me and my boyfriend will definetly be coming back!!! ^.^ So Delicious! But definetly try the Trifecta Shrimp (similar to Whole ShaBang from Boiling Crab)! Oh and yes the shrimp do come with heads attatched, but it just enhances the flavor! I do recommend to come Early maybe on a weekday, to get good service and avoid the rush! Other than that till next time Angry Crab Shack! ^.^"
1,"Great service.\nFriendly staff.\n\nPricy, but uses plant extracts, environmentally friendly, has no sulfate or paraffin, not tested on animals.\nGentle ingredients that don't irritate my sensitive skin.\n\nTheir unique graphic design and location appeal to me.\n\nMy fav is the Mango Evasion because of its scent and creative design.\n\nI also like their repairing hand butters (not hand cremes), it really works."
1,"LaVecchia's came recommended by a business associate as a nice place with great food in convenient location.  All true!\n\nTucked into the Hearst building, the restaurant can be a bit hard to find - its entrance is sublte, as is its patios area. The latter is under cover and looks like it would be cool and comfortable on a nice warm day.\n\nOur server was knowledgeable even if he looked like he just rolled off the futon.  We enjoyed the hot and cold appetizer towers at his recommendation for the table.  The oysters Rockefeller were the best!  Close seconds were the ceviche, raw oysters, calamari, and tuna sashimi.\n\nTwo in our party ordered steaks (what??), but fish was the main reason to be there.  My Thai yellow tail was really flavorful, the pineapple infused sticky rice was really lame.\n\nThe decor was a little cold where I think the decorator was going for casual chic.  It was fine for a group of six for a business dinner, but I'd think for a date it might not strike the right note.\n\nI'd go back and try more of their menu and definitely get the oysters Rockefeller!  Remember that they validate parking tickets too!"
1,"Pretty good cup of joe. \nGreat service and staff.\nMenu looked appetizing as well. \nFor me, the roast is mediocre, but the attention to detail is good. \nNice place to sit and read or study."
0,"$5.99 breakfast steak and eggs...\n\nTheir version of steak is 4 thin slices of beef.\nBest part is the potatoes.\nTheir french toast is not great.\n\nGreat price, but you get what you pay for.\nSave money and don't be expecting anything tasty."
0,"I just happened to pass by here on my long drive back to LAX.  I saw the sign which read \""wood fired pizza\"".  Thinking that this would mean that this place would have nice thin and crusty pizza, I drove in to get some for my drive.\n\nSurprisingly, they sold the pizza by the slice.  Most wood fired brick oven pizzas are sold by the mini-pie.  I asked for a slice and the gentleman behind the counter took a slice off of the heating cabinet and gave it to me.  I thought that was odd (I would have expected it to be placed into the oven to be heated).  I picked up the slice and immediately felt the droop of it.  The slice was just warm but more importantly, it was socking wet.  I gave it back to the guy and asked him to put it into the oven and make it extra crispy.  He did so and put it on a cookie sheet and put it into the oven.  3 minutes later he took it out of the oven and gave it back to me.  Now the slice was hot but the same drooping mess.  \n\nWOOD FIRED pizza should be crispy on the bottom and the crust - not wet on the bottom, droopy and a doughy \""crust\"".  Normally, it should be thin and crispy and served fresh.  This pizza is thick - like stuff I would get in a supermarket frozen department.\n\nI also ordered with this slice a Gyro.  I didn't think that gyros differed much from place to place but this was a semi-disaster too.  Unlike the pizza slice, this was much dryer.  There wasn't that much tsatziki yogurt sauce and more importantly, no lettuce at all.  It had 2 half slices of Tomato, some onions and of course the lamb but it felt half full.  Anywhere you go in LA and NY (where I'm from), Gyros are usually stuffed, lots of lettuce, tomato and yogurt sauce.  This felt like an imitation gyro in my opinion.\n\nI hate to leave negative reviews but this place I couldn't find anything good about it.\nThe place looked nice but unfortunately, the food was not."
1,"At a recent game 3 of the 5 people in my party (myself included)  were stung by hornets.  I can't say enough good about the staff response. The medics took great care of us. They cheered up our kid really well and then the manager gave us all new seats behind home plate with food and beverage too. We really enjoyed the rest of the game. Also they did deal with the hornets I promise. \n\nI have been to a bunch of other Mallards games too, and I always have a blast."
0,"Firstly, I overheard the cashier making very rude comments about a mentally challenged customer who had just left.  Even if these were   this employee's personal feelings I think it's in poor taste to express those kinds of thoughts in a tone that is audible enough for your other dining customers to here.\n\nI had to settle for Red Oak because the seating in both Starbucks and Caribou Coffee was all occupied.\n\nI ordered the banana and Nutella pancakes that were on special for $5.50.  Just the pancakes no sides were included.  I was hoping more then anything fruit was served with the pancakes..since the place appears to promote healthy food.  When dining in Toronto two slices of fruit usually comes standard but the same is not true around these parts.  Just a slice of honey dew would have been a cheerful addition to the pancakes but no such luck for me. The pancakes were cooked perfectly. \n\n I also got a blueberry mango smoothie that was really delicious and tasted very much of real mango and not of mango flavored syrup. \n\nWhat I did not agree with was the silverware system.  I assumed which I shouldn't have that I would be given silverware. However you have to get your own silverware.  I told the cashier when I placed my order this was my first time dining there it would have been nice had she pointed me in the direction of the silverware after learning that information.\n\nThere is a reason why this place was practically empty when the surrounding restaurant were packed.  The food is expensive. I saw on the chalk board menus that salads go for as much as $9.00 dollars there. \n\nI'd go back for another smootie but nothing more then that."
1,"Layers, O let me recount the times.....back when I lived in Las Vegas, they shared the same strip mall space next to TJ's and Layers was a weekend ritual for me. A jewel in the sea of strip malls and Starbucks. While not a great place for coffee (seriously, Las Vegas was always lacking in this department!), the desserts were good - from flourless orange almond spice cakes/tortes to rich chocolate decadence (check out their small molten chocolate ganache cakes...mmmmmm). And....i'm not a dessert person, so kudos to the bakery! BTW, on Saturdays, they always had something special on the menu - like applewood cheddar bacon scones. \n\nAnyways, I'm glad to hear that they're moving to a new location. One serious complaint was the lack of space - and now it seems like they're keen on correcting that. I can't wait to try them out again at their new location!"
0,"Location of the store is great! :) Camelback and 44th street is very convenient.   Its great store if you are an old grandmother or if you are looking for a present for grandmother!!\n I'm European woman, who used to high quality clothes, what you definitely will not find in this store. You also will not be able return your item for cash, only for store credit.   \nVery disappointed!"
1,"I came in for lunch since I was going to visit clients close by and was suprised how decent the food was. They had the wing special that day but I opted for the grlled fish sandwich with side of cole slaw. \n\nThe fish was larger then the bun and was quite tasty especially with the yummy tarter sauce.  The Slaw was decent too. My waitress Latrice was friendly and provided solid service. \n\nThis Hooters also has gaming, is super clean and is open 24/7."

1,Just moved to this side of town and am always looking for good Chinese food. I drove past the sign and decided to check it out. I didn't know it was mostly a take out place but once I was there decided to give it a try anyhow. I was surprised to see how  reasonable to prices were - great lunch specials. I ordered the Mongolian beef for myself and the Teriyaki chicken bowl for my husband. The food took about 15 minutes so i was confidant everything was cooked to order. Everything was delicious!! I would have given it 5 stars but when i pulled up outside at 11:15am (supposed to open at 11am)  the doors to the place were still locked and lights off... I was about to pull away when the owners showed up and welcomed me in. I am glad  they caught me otherwise I would have missed out!!
1,"SUNDAY FUNDAY!! Everything is half off on Sundays. Yes, so this is where you will be finding me when Sunday Night Football is on. They have flavored Saki that my friend has turned me on to. They have great sushi that is served to perfection. And lets not forget the DJ. Love the DJ. Bring your friends, get some Saki, and enjoy the last day of the weekend."
1,Nothing better in AZ.  This is where I would go for my last meal.
1,"If you work in an office and have to dress business casual, NY & Co is your place to shop. Some of their stuff can be a bit plain but more often then not, they have modest, cute, stylish, business casual clothes at an affordable price. I don't think I have ever been bugged by a salesperson when coming to this store which is actually kinda nice. I can't stand salespeople following me around chiming in about how cute something is (see my review on Coach in LV). Lastly, they have a great display of accent jewelry which is my weakness. Everything is always really different and fun so I can't resist and usually walk out with several pieces. The next time you are trying to find a place to shop, try NY & Co. There is something for everybody   :)"
0,"Danny's, why oh why did you leave me waiting for my car without telling me it was done? I came here to get my car detailed and they said it would take awhile so I grabbed my book and waited in the main area. After awhile of waiting inside, the air was getting too stiff, so I decided to move out to the fresh air and deal with the heat. I waited on the benches where they dry the cars. I waited and I waited. Finally after waiting nearly an hour, I decided to ask someone. I asked a man working there and he looks around, points to my car that's behind me in a random parking spot hidden from where I was waiting, and says the car's been ready for 20 minutes. However, nobody told me! I was sitting there and they saw me waiting (and mind you, I was the only one waiting), but nobody told me my car was ready. Who knows how much longer I would have waited if I hadn't asked. I was pretty disappointed in the lack of customer service and sadly, I don't think I will return to this Danny's anytime soon."
1,This would be 5 stars but the service was not what I expected.  When you drop $1000 on what is arguably a culinary journey that should be on every foodie's bucket list I would think service would be stellar (not so much).  The food...the cheese cart...the desert cart...amazing.  \n\nIf you call the Hotel they will send a complimentary limo and walk you through the exclusive MGM mansion on the way to the restaurant.
1,"Great Park with a good shaded picnic area! There's tennis court, a basketball court and a play area for the kids."
1,"Cuisine has never been particularly synonymous with Dutch culture, not in the way that \""Total Football\"" and a morally dubious attitude to both drugs and prostitution is. Having eaten in most of the surrounding cafes on my lunchtime adventures, I donned my clogs and finally decided to give this one a go.\n\nUpon arrival it became immediately apparent that it's not Dutch, at all. It's another falafel / hummus / kebab number with a bit of greasy spoon thrown in, and like most of it's neighbours, the food is pretty tasty. The Mediterranean side of it is anyway, I'm yet to try the bargain breakfast."
1,"The noodles are simply delicious here.  They have different varieties with thickness so be sure to ask. \n\nWe tried the #1 in the Noodles and Sauce section -- Noodles with Sliced Pork and Mushrooms.  The noodles had great al dente texture and it reminded me of simple home comfort chinese food.  Be sure to mix in the hot chili oil and other condiments they provide for a little kick.\n\nIn addition, we ordered the Beef Nugget soup (#2) which was tasty - I could really taste the 5 spice in the soup.  I think the #1 - the Lan Zhou spicy one will be much better.\n\nUnfortuntately I am not as big a fan of the dumplings as some of the other Yelpers.  Don't get me wrong - they're good but I found it to be a little oily.  I like the way they serve it upside down.  If you're in a smal group, perhaps order one because they're still pretty good.  I'd still rather get dumplings at Noodle Pot.\n\nOverall, the star of the show here is the noodles.  I would recommend only ordering the noodle dishes between stir fries and soups and varying the types of noodles."
0,"Mediocre food for a hefty price. Service wasn't impressive either. There are much better fine dining options in Las Vegas that are \""trendy\"".  I mean it wasn't horrible but it was a disappointment :p"
0,Selling water in a desert problem again.  Buy $5.00 coffees for 15 years but when you sweat your balls off walking from your car to the door and just need a water the charge for tap water is $.30.  Less than a mcDonald's dollar for a cup of water. But now I am thinking people with cups all over their car might not be so crazy here.  Must be a nevada policy.  Never had to pay for tap water in california at mcdonalds or starbucks.  A cup does not cost a dollar.
0,"Ok, I get that you guys are into slow food but do you have to hire slow servers?  Came here for lunch with a friend and was disappointed.  My server didn't understand that bringing water to your guest is more important than bussing your tables, she bussed two tables before she completed my drink request.  I ordered the Anastasia cocktail and it was great, light and refreshing without being too sweet or over powering.\n\nI wish they offered more of the dinner menu on the lunch menu but I ordered the  1/2 salad and pasta combo.  I got the fettuccini bianco which had great flavor and half of a Cesar salad.  I was disappointed with my \""half\"" salad as the portion size literally looked like a small handful of lettuce.  The pasta came with crispy pancetta and there were 8 tiny pieces in my pasta, I counted because they were my fav part.  Again the service was disappointing, it was obvious my plate had \""sat\"" before it got to me, the sauce on my pasta had a skin on it and my salad was warm.  My server offered fresh pepper for my salad but I really wanted fresh grated parmesan on my pasta, I could see it sitting on the server station in the middle of the room but it wasn't offered.  There was no team work from the other servers, no one offered to clear my plate or refresh my water and my server was too busy clearing tables to notice.\n\nI have previously eaten lunch here and miss the fresh bread and amuse bouche that they used to serve.  I did enjoy the food at this visit but not the service or portion size.  My bill was $21 for lunch and my experience did not match with the amount I paid."
0,"Handicap Accessible CONCERNS.\n\nWe booked 2 rooms, 1 being handicap accessible.  \nCONS\n1.  Room was in the middle of a long hallway corridor.\n2.  Room fair walking distance from the parking lot\n3.  A/C quit working in the at Midnight, service personnel arrived at 2AM, was able to get fan working but was not until 3AM.  \n4.  Addressed issues with staff at checkout and refused eye contact & said they'd look into with \""no apology\""\n\nPRO\n1.  Shower was a walk-in\n\nBoth rooms were nice set-ups modern appointments.  The 2nd room booked was fine.  However my biggest concern is anyone with handicap issues is vulnerable and with the hotel not addressing maintenance issues timely, makes me rethink for next time.  Plus the hotel is not the best appointed for Handicap accessibility.  My rooms were for family who had 'walking issues' with canes, definitely a too long of walk for them."
1,"Now here's a Fox Restaurant Concept I can get behind (well, mostly).  The prices are still exorbitant for what you get (hence the reason I can't give this 5 stars), but that's the story of the entire Fox family.  Like Sauce, Flower Child is a fast casual concept.  Step in, order your food and pay at the counter, and seat yourself.  Unlike Sauce however, you're given a lot of freedom to customize your meal in a multitude of ways.  And the menu is decidedly on the healthier end.  Tonight I came with my siblings for the newest Fox experience.\n\nThe restaurant is located across the street from the Henry, on the northeast corner of 44th and Camelback just behind the Schmidt Jewelers.  When you step inside it almost feels like a health food restaurant.  I'm not sure why, but the color scheme and the setup just gives off that type of vibe.  Not a hipster or hippie vibe, more like an indoor farmers market vibe.  At any rate, we came around 6pm on a Sunday.  It was starting to get busy but there was still plenty of seating available inside.\n\nI decided to go with a veggie & grain bowl as those are the most customizable of the menu.  You choose one of four proteins and then add 1, 2, or 3 amongst 12 possible side items.  For my protein, I went with the salmon.  For the sides, I went with the roasted veggies, organic mashed potatoes, and seasonal fruit.  They also have more exotic options like quinoa, kale, sweet potatoes, and even soba noodles.  For a drink I went with lemonade.  They actually have about a half dozen lemonades you can choose from at their lemonade dispenser (all mixed in house).  I went traditional and chose the house lemonade.  Total cost for my bowl and lemonade was $20.  Yup, its pricey, though I guess the silver lining was that I didn't have to tip anyone.\n\nTook less than 10 minutes for them to bring the food to our table.  The presentation was impressive and the portions were adequate (I was actually expecting smaller).  In terms of taste, I was actually pretty impressed.  The salmon was cooked perfectly and had enough where it felt like a main course of the dish.  I was actually really surprised how good the veggies were.  Some of them had a good char on them but it didn't detract from the taste at all.  The potatoes were super creamy without feeling like I was scooping up a butter bomb.  And the fruit bowl was very fresh.  And maybe Sam Fox was listening to me when I said I despised all the pulp I had in my lemonade at the Henry.  Here, there wasn't a trace of pulp in my lemonade.  Thank goodness.  \n\nThe service we received was excellent.  Granted there wasn't much of it to be had since its fast casual, but the gals at the register were friendly and helpful with the menu and the woman who brought our food and took our plates was also very friendly and attentive without being intrusive.  By the time we were done, the place was jam packed with Arcadia residents, but it still felt comfortable to us.\n\nSo alright Sam Fox, we haven't seen eye to eye very often, but you might actually be on to something with this concept.  For the health conscious and foodies alike, there's a lot to like about this place.  The prices are still steep for what you're doling out, but at least here you're doling out some really good quality food, quality service, and the always quintessential Fox atmosphere.  And at least here we the customers have some say over the look of our food.  And once again Sam, thank you for expelling the pulp from my lemonade."
1,"In town from Calif for a conference.  Craving steakhouse, and found Keg as one of the highest rated, so decided to give it a try.  Brought a bottle of wine, assuming they can provide corkage.  General Manager, Bobby Price, very tactfully explained to me that wasn't an option, due to liquor license specs, which is surprising, but fine with me.  They stored my wine bottle in their temperature controlled wine cooler.\nEnjoyed an excellent steak dinner, with wonderful wines available on their list.  Prime rib for me, filet mignon (plus some tasty bernaise sauce) for the wife, and the sliders for my 8 yo daughter.  I tried the sliders, and initially thought it was steak, since the meat was very high quality.  Amy, our server, was excellent and attentive, but not intrusive at all.  Ended up going the full nine yards, including a complementary app (bacon wrapped scallops), all the way to a decadent brownie sundae, enjoyed with some cordials (glenmorangie for me, and a generous glass of tawny port for my wife).  When in AZ, we'll definitely plan to come back here, mainly for the excellent service at all levels, along with some of the best steakhouse-style food we've had."

1,"So, I am rating this place with 4 stars, only because it was my first time going here and I want to go back before I add the extra star.\n\nI am definitely one who is weary of new doctor offices, especially ones that I have never been to before.  I didn't like the last place I went to, so I decided to try somewhere new, and this place is right across the street from my place.  I called, scheduled an appointment (w/o difficulty), and that was that.\n\nThe facility is HUGE.  They have an aesthetic place inside of it.  It seemed like it took me several turns down several halls just to go to my appointment room.  I was greeted by a front office administrator, checked in, and waited.  I scheduled my appointment as early as I could (8:30 am) so that I didn't have to wait long to be seen.\n\nI was called back immediately and greeted by a very friendly back office MA.  She took my vitals, asked several questions, and was off to get the P.A. (Julia).  I was very impressed with the sincere tone of voice and attitude she had.\n\nJulia came right in, smiles and all, and started at it.  I had several concerns to discuss, and she addressed each one with detail and explanation in terms that made sense to me.  I was provided with several samples to use for my condition and was encouraged to come back in 2 weeks for follow-up.\n\nOne reason that I am iffy on new facilities is because I always feel like they try and \""sell\"" you on services.  I got a slight sense of this when I came in.  I wanted to inquire about a full body scan (I have sensitive skin and am at risk of pre-cancerous lesions).  They were adamant about doing it right then and there.  I also had a benign popule under my eyelid, which apparently is considered cosmetic to remove, and they also wanted to have at it in that same visit.  I appreciate them wanting to get it all done, but I didn't have the money up front to throw down for the removal, and wasn't sure how much my insurance would cover for the full body scan.  I opted out this visit to seek this information first.  \n\nIn either case, I definitely recommend this place to anyone.  All of the staff that interacted with was friendly and caring, and concerned about the healing and well being of the patient.\n\nI will provide an updated review when I go back and let you know if they have earned their extra star!  :)"
0,"High prices for small amounts of food. My mother and I ordered the mussels and the kampachi sashimi for appetizers to split, I had the monkfish for my entree, and my mother had the vegetarian special (couscous salad with tofu scramble on top). We expected with ordering all of those things that we would leave with leftovers but not even close.  The bill was $91.  It would be one thing if the taste of the food was outstanding but that fell way short also. The mussels were bland and boring, the sashimi was so small in portion size that we were turned off to it from just looking at it, the monkfish was way over salted, and the couscous salad was very bitter from what seemed to be a vinegar-y dressing of some sort. We will not return."
1,"Had a positive experience at Bombay. The food tasted as expected. I had the chicken tikka masala, lamb biriyani, and garlic nan. Everything was tasty, but the garlic nan was phenomenal. I would return."
0,"Place is an absolute joke.\n\nAfter reading other reviews, it seems like I am not the only one who is having issues with a company who is in the \""parts\"" business ordering the wrong parts.   This is happened multiple times to us.   Their customer service is awful.   \n\nI doubt anyone will read this but others should know not to use a company who provides sub par service.\n\nOh... and we a still waiting for this \""mythical\"" part to show up, it's been over a month."
1,"Color me impressed.\n\nGiven the quality of sushi restaurants in the greater Valley area, I was worried about conveyor belt sushi here. I mean, if they can't make it right in the kitchen, how is it gonna be on a roving belt?\n\nMy worries were for naught.  Despite the 30 minute wait on a Tuesday night at 7:45pm (yes, it was that crowded), and having trouble finding it (there is no sign from the street -- you HAVE to know where it is), it was all worth it.\n\nMy companions (all fish eaters but me) LOVED it. They said the fish was fresh, delicious, exciting etc. I loved the seaweed salad and edamame to start, and then went for two dishes of Inari, a place of veggie rolls, and then wound up ordering 3 orders (so a total of 12 individual) avocado rolls, because none were coming around.  All that, plus iced tea, cost me $16.  AMAZING.\n\nMy partner ate all sorts of rolls; her favorite was the I Love Salmon Roll and also the Caterpillar Roll, although she enjoyed the Rainbow Roll and Dragon Rolls as well.  Wasn't impressed with the Las Vegas Roll, and wished that they had more exciting, different, unique rolls (they had one; the Haru Sushi, which she did enjoy).  Her total, with iced tea? $18. Seriously. Oh, and we shared a place of cream puffs for dessert.\n\nThere were no plates more than $2. The cheesecake had two $2 plates, making it 4, but other than that, nothing, including special orders, was more than $2.  The avocado rolls I had were some of the best I've enjoyed (they were bursting full of avocado, instead of one small piece), and the Inari was delicious. Ginger on the table (as well as unagi sauce and soy sauce), quick to fill up iced tea. I was in heaven.\n\nI do wish they'd have more vegetarian rolls so I didn't have to order them. The whole time we were there, only one veggie roll went by - the one I ate.  No cucumber, avocado, daikon, etc unless you ordered them. I also wish Wasabi was on the table, instead of brought to you in a hunk; I didn't want to use it all at once, but I had to take it out of my dish to save for later and put...where?\n\nAlso, I loved the \""other\"" options, like juice, V8, Ramun (Japanese soda), pudding cups, fruit, cheesecake and more on the belt. Gave lots of options.  It did take forever to get our bill, but all that aside, we will most definitely be back."

0,"STAY AWAY FROM THIS PLACE!  LIARS, LIARS, LIARS!  BAIT and SWITCH!  After having a great gel manicure by Lynn the week before, I told my mom to call and make an appointment b/c they were offering 40% off all services due to Pro Nails by Lynn being a new business.  When mom called and spoke to Lynn she said they were no longer offering the 40% but were now offering a 15% off \""Back to School\"" special.  I then called 15 mins later to ask Lynn if she would still honor the 40% due to my mom being a referral from me.  She said no, and that she could only do 15% off.  So I scheduled an appointment for mom the next day at noon b/c Lynn was not available earlier that morning due to taking her children to the dentist.  I gave Lynn mom's name and that was it, appointment made. So the next day my mom showed up for her appointment and this is where the DISHONESTY begins!  Lynn tells my mom that the back to school special was only for students with student ID's. Which is funny b/c she never bothered to mention that on either phone call w/ both of us the day prior.  So mom calls me and I get on the phone with Lynn. I was very direct w/ her and said you'd better honor your word or mom will go elsewhere. She agreed to the 15%. I was disturbed by the fact she lied and denied having a conversation with me just the day before, but I got over it, and went about my day.  Mom called after her appt to tell me Lynn had pawned her off on another nail tech instead of doing it herself. I had specifically made the appointment with Lynn because she had done such a great job w/ my nails. LYNN KNEW FULL WELL THAT SHE WAS SUPPOSED TO DO MOM'S NAILS!  SHE WAS THE ONE THAT MADE THE APPT FOR NOON B/C SHE WASN'T AVAILABLE EARLIER DUE TO BEING AT THE DENTIST WITH HER KIDS!!!  So when mom started to describe what the other nail tech did(and DIDN'T do) with her nails, I immediately knew she had been screwed!  Then to top it all off, LYNN didn't even give my mom a full 15% off!  She overcharged her by $.45, which isn't a big deal in terms of the $, but it is the principal of the matter!  SO DISHONEST!!  DO YOURSELF A FAVOR AND GO ELSEWHERE!"
1,"I do love the food here.  Yin's is not much to look at from the outside of the building and I am not sure if I want to be in this neighborhood after dark but, oh, the food!  Hot, fresh and just the way I think it shoud taste every time.  The employees are nice and service fast.  A must try is the egg drop soup."
1,"I'm in love with this store.\n\nPrices are fairly steep, but you're getting what you pay for. The quality of the clothing is good. I have bought two dresses from the boutique (one at this location and another in San Francisco). I'm super satisfied with my purchases.\n\nWhen you're buying specialty dresses, you're gonna pay specialty prices. The shopping experience is great! The girls are very friendly and help you find the right accessories and sizes. \n\nThere are gorgeous shoes, swimsuits, dresses, coats, pants, and accessories to choose from. The store is exciting just to walk through!\n\nYou'll love anything you buy from here."
0,"Chef Kathy had to resort to mentioning \""libel\"" and then defining it for us in case we are not intelligent enough on Yelp to know what it means.  I'm well aware and she would be laughed out of a court of law  if she wanted to spend the money to sue someone for voicing an opinion and sharing an experience on a forum, if however, she was confident in her customer service she would not have even responded.  We live in  America last time I checked and can have an opinion and share it out loud, I'm not standing outside her business making comments,  and this website is meant for people to share opinions, I'm positive my one negative comment will not close her business doors but in these tough times when I see the mall food court had to close down she should change her attitude and be happy she is still in business and kind to her customers  Honestly, I really need not say more because anyone who reads her own comment in response to my comment can see  what I meant. I'm glad Yelp is a sounding board and a place for real people to get real information without it being censored and I think this is a great forum for hearing other's true experience and I have never had any other negative reviews on here other than that one because I truly do not enjoy saying negative things about anyone but felt strong in that case."

1,"A very classy Irish bar. Plenty of TVs and one projector screen for watching games. Good selection of about 15 European beers. Very quality bar food, I've had about half the menu and haven't been disappointed yet, but it's not going to blow you away by any stretch. The waitress staff is spotty with service, they seem to go in the back to the cooking area and stay awhile for no apparent reason. I would stick to sitting at the bar if possible. They have bands here on Thursday and Saturday and if you don't mind how loud they are, then it can be fun."
1,"I have nothing but good things to say about the staff.  Every time I walk in the doors I am greeted and everyone is helpful, friendly and knowledgeable about the products they carry.  They are quick with the repair that I needed and offered helpful tips that improved my positioning on the bike.  They will continue to be my local shop and receive my business in the future."
0,"Stay away!!!! Room was nasty, toilet wouldn't flush, stank, tub was rusted, we could barely get in any tv channels and it kept going out, no choice of smoking or non-smoking and absolutely disgusting and they wouldn't let us leave the parking garage with the parking pass bc nobody told us you must have your receipt which we threw away. Complete waste of time and $$. Go somewhere else."

0,"Disclaimer: I've only passed through this airport for connection flights and I've never had much of a lay over. \n\nIt's not as big as many of the other hubs like Detroit, Atlanta and Minneapolis. But it's still big enough to need a tram of some sort. I've not spotted a tram if there is one here. The moving sidewalks just don't cut it when your connecting flight is already boarding. Many of the moving sidewalks (and there are a lot of them) weren't working, as in out of service. Even an escalator was out of service. If you've ever wondered what it's like to tote a carry on luggage up stairs, I'll inform you that it's not very fun. \n\nThe bathroom had an attendant but the bathroom wasn't as clean as many of the other airport bathrooms that I've used. There weren't any toilet seat covers. Some airports even have the rotating plastic seat covers, so nothing at all is very \""behind in the time\"". \n\nThere was a food court and an area that had rocking chairs. That was a first time that I've noticed rocking chairs in an airport. I didn't use them, it was just another observation, plus I was trying to note something positive about this airport."

My car just happened to be super dirty and they are near my house."
0,"Stayed here during my first time in Vegas. Got a pretty good deal online. The room we got was part of the newly renovated section of the hotel. It was in Tower 2 facing New York New York and had a gorgeous view of the strip. It was spacious including the bathroom (no tub) and there was easy access to the elevator and the side of the parking lot where we parked. Going in and out was no problem. I just didn't like the overall ambience. It was very dark and gloomy (my pet peeves) and you immediately smell carpet cleaning solution as soon as you walk in. Plus, there are people by the entrance selling time-shares and they are targeting couples. Don't be fooled! My boyfriend and I were very annoyed by them. We learned not to walk in holding hands. The whole medieval theme seems to be half-a**ed. Now that I am more familiar with Vegas, I think I will try another hotel next time..."
1,"I was pleasantly surprised to see a number of positive reviews from the Yelp faithful for a sports bar/grill, so the wife and I decided to head over for some college football over Labor Day weekend.\n\nThe layout is great with a long bar and two big areas for seating.  One area is mostly high-top tables and is more bar-centric.  The other area is almost all large booths with plenty of space for 8+ folks per table.  \n\nThe TVs are EVERYWHERE and cover just about every seating angle.  It's definitely a sports bar that also has a big menu, not a restaurant that also shows sporting events.  Sound is turned up for most games so you had better be there for a game and not just to eat as there is no escaping the TVs and sound.\n\nThe good news is that if you are there to watch sports, there's plenty to like besides all the TVs.  There were over 15 beers on tap plus an equal number of bottled choices.  My wife said her mixed drink was well made and plenty strong - they also have a specialty drink list for those that like a little help selecting their beverage. \n\nThe menu was BIG and the food we ordered was very tasty.  My wife got the Rib Sampler off the appetizer list which consisted of four \""fall of the bone\"" pork ribs that were served very hot and were really good.  I got the Buffalo Chicken Salad which was well made, had good crisp chicken, hot buffalo sauce, and lots of greens.  If there was one critique of the food list, it was that it could be a bit repetitive across the categories (e.g. Buffalo chicken wrap, salad, burger, strips, etc.)\n\nThe staff was friendly and accomodating - service was quick and they accepted a coupon I had from localdines for $30 of food with no issues (something I recommend grabbing if you are headed here anytime soon).\n\nwe'll definitely be back for whatever the next \""big game\"" is - Blue 32 is a cut above the Zipps and Fox Sports Grills in Scottsdale and worth serious consideration for your next sports-fueled food fest might be."
0,"Our first meal in Vegas was here, with our group of 8. Nice ambiance, the staff was pleasant, and we loved to open kitchen concept. We started with the carpaccio. Completely underwhelmed. And the meal just got more expensive and more mediocre after that...the grilled salad was disliked and sent back by two out of three diners, with the third feeling like since he didn't hate it, he'd eat it. The steaks were rated by our table as anywhere between \""fine\"" and \""not great\"". I had the short ribs...and thought they were okay. But not great...and by the end of the night, we left disappointed. And by the next day, we've dubbed this place the dog of our stay. Bummer."

My hair is now decent after my 2nd haircut today, but the cuts from their razors on the back of my neck is another story.  I sure hope that blade was sterile.   If you want a traditional old fashioned haircut, I guess this is the place to go.  Not for me.  I also asked for advise from the 1st barber I approached to recommend the individual who could do such a cut, and he obviously steered me wrong.  Not everyone in there is as great as he made it out to be.  Absolutely a horrible haircut, my neck burns, waste of time and money.  Absolute garbage."
1,This is a Strip quality hotel that's smack in the middle of Downtown Las Vegas. This hotel has a little bit of everything and it does it very well. Fremont Street has that tank top and shorts kind of feel but when you walk into The Golden Nugget you kinda feel under dressed...That is unless you are going to their beautiful shark tank / slide / Pool / lounge area...They even have an okay night club that overlooks Fremont from a second floor deck called Gold Diggers. The hotels' prices a little high for Downtown's standards but you definitely get your moneys worth. If this hotel was on the strip they would easily charge twice the price. \nYou will not be disappointed with this hotel.

0,"My roommate called Windy City tonight to place a delivery order from his cell & Tina answered, she was extremely rude and nasty saying \""We don't deliver to you, your out of our 5 miles zone\"" Which is a complete crock because on April 8th at 8:19pm I placed an order for delivery with Nena V check number 126, Approval code for my debit card is 041923. Yes I have the receipt which everyone can on Windy City's Facebook Page. My roommate then called back and asked to speak with the manager because her attitude was so bad and the fact she lied to him about the delivery, he wanted to let someone know. Well when he called back and asked for the manager she proceeds to say \""Oh Jeff, well the manager is cooking he will call you back\"" He is from Chicago, He Loves the food here and even got me admit Chicago does better pizza and I'm from New York. but after this experience we both will NEVER go there again. We rather drive to the other side of town and go their location on Lake Mead. Also watch out for out for this locations apparent bad business practices because I just noticed on my bank statement they charged me $38.13. I did NOT give a $10 dollar tip!!!!!!   If you notice on the receipt I was already charged $3.00 for a tip!!!!"
0,"The food has gone downhill since they closed the Scottsdale location and got new owners or cooks or whomever. I had not eaten here in a long time because the last few times I had been in the pizza was not as good as it used to be. I also had found a better place closer to home. Well, I thought I would give them another try tonight since the reviews are still good. It had been a long, hectic week at work. I happen to be driving by and I just wanted to sit down with my new book and eat. This was a very strange and demeaning experience. I have never had anything like this ever happen to me before. It upset me so I was compelled to write this update.  \n\nThis restaurant is very small. Too small for how popular it seems to be. They have only five tables in the place and if you sit at two of them it is very awkward since you are right by the kitchen door ( And in the way) or under the TV. I apparently forgot about that tonight.  It is certainly not a place to bring a party of fifteen and then book a party of eight. \n\nI walked in and there was a very long table of about 20 up against the wall. They really did not fit in the restaurant at all. The kids with them were very noisy and not being disciplined of course by any adults. The other three small tables were filled with diners looking non too happy at the noise level and squished floor space. I should have left right then and there but I was in no rush. I noticed that two of the \""Two Top\"" tables were finishing up so I waited by the kitchen window to sit. Again, very awkward just standing there. I felt so in the way.  The server looked at me and said, \""Just give me just one minute. Here is a menu.\"" Well, I stood there for about fifteen minutes. \n\nA couple left shortly after that. I assumed the table would be cleared for me but it never happened. I stood by the window for five more minutes waiting. Finally, I sat down at one of the tables. A busser and a staff member walked by twice and no one cleared the table or acknowledged me. I started looking at the menu. After ten more minutes the waitress came back and said. \""So are you wanting to eat? I was flabbergasted. I am thinking to myself, \""What the heck?\"" \""Well, YES! I do want to eat since this is a restaurant, right? But I meekly look at her, smile, and say, \"" Of course.\"" Maybe she is having an off night with that crazy 20 top over on the wall. Needless to say I was very confused and starting to get frustrated. I wasn't sure how to answer or what she was trying to communicate. I assumed she forgot that she already asked me if I wanted take out or not. Not being a Harvard attorney I wanted to make sure to not go all postal on her.  \n\nWell, the waitress finally asks, \""Well, do you want to eat here?\"" I might note that she has made no effort to start clearing the dirty table either. So now I am very confused. Shall I eat here? What is that suppose to mean? Shall I eat here? Well heck no, maybe I will eat in the kitchen, bathroom, or on the floor? In the parking lot? I can only conclude they do not want my business. I am thinking to myself, \""Is this a joke? Am I on one of those reality TV shows? What is the problem here?\"" I have no idea what is going on.\n\nShe then looks at me and says, \""Well, SHE said there is a reservation at eight.\""( I still have no idea who \""SHE\"" is.) I looked at my watch which said 7:10pm. Again, super confused hungry gal here. Also, what does this have to do with me anyway? The server finally gets her act together to tell me they have a table of eight coming in with a reservation, not a reservation at 8pm. Wow, reservations at this place, Really? Okay, I still had no idea when or why she was telling me this since I was at a Two Top not an Eight Top. The only other tables in the place were Two Tops that all together did not add up to eight. A reservation of eight would not fit anywhere in this place, anytime soon.\n\nI finally looked at her, forcing her to communicate. \""So are you saying you do not want to serve me? Do you not have room for me?\"" I hate being a mind reader on a Friday night after working with 8 year old kids all day. To this question the server replies, \""No not at all. She says ( Who the heck is SHE?)  that we can bring you food. It has to be fast and you have to eat it fast. We need your table.\"" Now I get it! I can not reply though because my jaw has fallen to the floor in utter shock at her request. I walked out on the spot.  \n\nI was not sure how I felt about this. I totally understand having no room or a wait time. I even understand a reservation system since I eat out a lot. ( But shocked that such a divey place in the hood would take them) I can even understand they can not expand their space just for lil ole me. However, what I can not understand in any shape or form is why no one thought to tell me any of this before I wasted 30 minutes of my Friday night just standing there. Also, to tell a customer they need to rush their food intake, at an Italian place no less, is sinful!"
1,"I have to say...there are not many times that food is good enough to surpass not so good service. This is one of those times. \n\nI went here on a Friday night for a drink and a light dinner with my husband and daughter. When the server came over I asked if they have Margaritas...and she said yeah...what kind I asked?? UUUhhhh the red and the green one was the response...I was so shocked by this I could not even get angry...I laughed very hard on the inside. Anyway..I ordered the \""green\"" margarita on the rocks ($4.50) and it was not too bad. The husband had the happy hour beer special for $2 and got 2 coronas.\n\nTo eat the husband and I shared the 3 taco plate and added an extra taco. We got 2 carne asada and 2 barbacoa with rice and beans ($8.95). The tacos were soooo yummy...lots and lots of meat with a sprinkling of cilantro and onion ...and thats it...the way tacos should be. They were served on a homemade corn tortilla that was thick and delicious. The barbacoa was our favorite and I found myself taking very small bites to make it last as long as possible. The rice and beans were perfect also.\n\nMy daughter had already eaten dinner so she ordered the sopapillas. They were totally like grandma makes...and were served in a brown paper bag piled high and accompanied by the little bear honey to drizzle on their already sweet goodness.\n\nWhen we were done the husband decided he wanted to take home a taco with each of the different meats they offer ( I think are like 6 or more types of meat ) Which by the way when I asked what a certain kind of meat was that I had never heard of before to our server she told me to read the menu...thanks!! Anyway...sadly the were out of every meat except the two we already had...so we just got the 2 tacos 2 go. When the server brought them to us she was like...so are you done NOW? LOL...wow.\n\nI do not think she meant to rude....I just think she was not experienced. But hey...I will definetly go back and am looking forward to trying their other menu items.\n\nGo check this place out...and they serve Menudo all day Saturday and Sunday."
1,"This place used to be the old waterworld and they have completely redone the place. I believe they have installed about 8 new slides/attractions and they are by far the best water park out there. Plan on spending all day at the park as you wont want to leave! \n\nThere can be long lines at certain times of the day, especially when school is out and all the kids are there! The food on site is decent, but not great. Some areas of the park have cement and it can be hot to walk on, may want to bring water socks to wear while at that park."
1,"I used Creations in Cuisine to cater for my wedding reception and the food was fantastic, it was a few years ago but I can still remember the awesome ravioli dish we had and the chicken dish was very flavorful.  I also love their shrimp cocktail, the cocktail sauce had a nice kick to it.  I also went to a Christmas party that they catered and they had prime rib & some of the best mash potatoes I have ever had.  The owners are also very nice and sat with us and took their time to help us choose our dish items, their location is nice with a great display everything and you can see their whole operation.  They also have all the rental stuff for a complete dining experience.  I always recommend them and rave about how their head Chef was a 5 star from the Boulders Resort!"
0,"Not sure if I ever reviewed this place yet or not.  If it weren't for the shrimp cakes dim sum then this place would have no stars.  I have to say I will never come back to this place again for the horrible customer service.  I went there to try to place a to go order and the person at the cash register said they were still closed but it was just another 10 mins so we waited patiently outside the entrance.  A heard of people came out of nowhere and after we were already standing behind a person, which I was there before they got there.  I still waited behind.  After the person had his order taken the cashier rudely had said she would not take our order that we had to wait behind the long line of people.  And I told her you seen me I was here before all these people even showed up.  Wow I bet if I was an older couple I bet she would have took our order anyway.   That is just poor customer service and lacking hospitality.  I will make sure I let everyone and anyone know that these people or at least the cashier who opened up the shift today on a Sunday evening is more of a reason for a food aficionado like me be pissed enough to bring my business and loyalty else where.  Yep unprofessional and never will go there again...  I'm hoping they are not  directly connected to the gold coast since one of my best friends was previously an hr director there... its a shame!"
1,"New to the area, my husband and I have already hit the highest rated sushi places in Pittsburgh. And while many were good, this BY FAR is the very BEST we have had!\n\nNewly opened, the restaurant is a good space. The front room looks small, but there's another dining area in the back. It was quiet when we came--a Monday night before the dinner rush. We were seated, given water and menus, and had our order taken fairly quickly. Miso soup came out right away.\n\nWe ordered the spicy tuna roll, the yellow tail roll and the hibachi chicken entree. Both rolls came out together and let me say: the fish is incredibly fresh! The sushi was absolutely delicious. We were so happy with it, we wanted to order more rolls just to take home with us. Luckily we didn't, because we ate the entire hibachi chicken entree. Cleaned the plate, it was so good. The staff was friendly, and the owner came around and asked us, and all the other diners, how our dinner was.\n\nAt the end of the meal, the owner brought us our check and gave us each a Hello Kitty chocolate marshmallow. It might sound odd to mention it, but to us, it was a sign that the owner really cared about his customers. He wanted to make a lasting good impression. Well, he did. We plan on returning frequently."
1,"Coming from Seattle and being used to a completely different style of Chinese food, this place was acceptable.\n\nThe service was quick, they didn't mind the 3 of us sitting at a table for a while, and the food was ok.  It's one of the better places I've had Chinese food in Phoenix and would definitely go back.\n\nI had the Mongolian Beef and it was quite bland, but good nonetheless.  I'd definitely go here again."
1,"I just checked this bar out after moving to Mountain's Edge.  It's a small local bar with a nice clean environment.  Both bartenders I have met have been super cool, Dave and Eric (both Graveyard bartenders) are friendly and make you feel right at home.  I've hit 5 spots two nights in a row, so it's nice knowing their machines pay frequently...plus their food is pretty good!  Great local spot, will definitely be back again!"
1,"Look down at your nails. Go ahead do it. Now tell your hands you're sorry. Now tell your hands you'll make it up to them by taking them to 7 day spa and nails. \nI just got a manicure from this place. I'm being serious. My nails are still wet. i work at a salon and spa so I hardly go anywhere else to get services done, but our nail technician is always busy and I had to get in before a trip. So I went two doors down to get my nails did! \nI wasn't expecting much from the outside. It looks like your average hole in the wall nail place. But when I walked in I was pleasantly greeted and immediately taken. \nMy lady didn't really speak English too well, but she was nice enough and asked if I was OK. Very very nice. \nI found out that this location does waxing. I'm not a hundred percent that I would recommend coming here to receive a wax since I had a little trouble communicating with my lady. But the women who went back there came out with decent looking brows. So I could always be wrong. \nAll in all, my nails came out very good and the women worked well under the time crunch I had. I will most certainly be back for a pedicure and another mani. I had a good experience."
0,"overpriced, small portions. There's far better food for the same price range."
0,"We order out from there once in awhile at work, and since the remodel, they act like the customer does not matter. First they got the order wrong, and then charged double for a couple of the items. When we called them to notify of the charges, they stated that this was the correct price and the ones on the internet menu are wrong. For a matter of $5 that they refused to refund and dismissed the issues with our order, they have lost at least 10 customers from our place of work as I will order from another place instead. Very very disappointed as I loved this place when I first ate there. At my old job, I ate there once a week. No mas!"
0,"I am a resident/local of Las Vegas.  Family and friends come from all over to visit me.  The last time (4/26/14) I tried to bring folks here- we were guest listed-waited in line for an(930) hour to be put in another line by a promoter promising it would be faster- I kindly ask the gentleman group in front of me how long they have been waiting, he said for 2 hours.\nWhen I finally got attention from the front door guy, he was so very RUDE to me that the gentleman group before me said forget this and left.  You would think the jerk was smart enough to know that patrons of an establishment such as this are the reason he gets a paycheck or a raise.  So I took my hot girlfriends to Surrender with NO problem and had a BLAST!\nPrior to this time, I waited in line for again-over an hour.  Got in and it was almost empty at 1145 on a Saturday.  The reason to wait for over an hour instead of being inside spending on drinks is completely ridiculous to do as a business!  I get that they want people walking by seeing people in a line so they can assume this is the spot to be.\nNOT!!! The only thing in the Mirage I still go to is the BARE pool..no snobs at the door there.."
1,"What a fun place!  Fortunately I knew it was IN the Antiques Marketplace because I read all the reviews last night.  As soon as you walk into the Marketplace, you can smell the hot dogs cooking!  Walk towards the left, pass by aisles of \""antiques\"", and once you see all the Pittsburgh sports stuff and a few tables, you've found Pittsburgh Willies.\n\nRand and I had a seat while we were waiting for Lynn and Claire and met Randy the owner.  Very friendly and a gracious host.  Being from Chicago and growing up on Chicago style hot dogs, I was a little unsure about some of the weird combinations on the menu, so I played it safe and went with the 3 Legged Chili and Cheese - almost 1/2 lb of Big Willy sliced in 3 - over a split sesame bun and covered in chili with big pieces of beef and lots of cheese!  Yum!  The hot dog was good quality and the chili was better than I expected.  Had a side of potato salad that was pretty good also.  They have a refrigerator case for your drinks, cans of soda are only $1.  They also had glass bottles of Coke and Pepsi.\n\nOn Wed they have homemade potato and cheese pierogis and Randy said to call ahead if you're not coming until the evening because they almost always run out before they close at 7pm.  \n\nTake a stroll through the Antiques Marketplace after lunch.  They said it's the largest one in Arizona!"
0,Place was very plainly decorated. No receptionist. I sat for 30 minutes with no service and was only spoke to once. I ended up walking away without my brows done.
0,"The manager is extremely rude.  I couldn't look at a single painting without my boyfriend being called pathetic and me being asked probing questions about my occupation and collection.  After being led through an awkward, probing conversation, where the manager decided we had too little money for his time we were told to look around quickly and leave."
1,"The DawgFather Grill is just around the corner from my office, so it was only a matter of time until I decided to go check it out.\n\nWhen I first went there, the woman behind the corner surprisingly didn't seem all that enthused about the hot dogs, so I took her advice and got the philly cheesesteak sandwich. It was ok, but I didn't really think it was all that great. As such, I resolved to actually try a hot dog the next time I came.\n\nWhen I next visited, I ordered one of their big dawgs (1/4 lb angus beef) with all the toppings (ketchup, mustard, onions, relish, and shredded cheese). I also ordered a normal-sized version of one of their Jersey dawgs, which is deep fried and has only mustard on it.\n\nSummary: The Big Dawg was simply delicious, and perfectly matched my definition of a good hot dog. The Jersey Dawg was ok, but the normal-sized hotdog just seemed ridiculously thin in comparison to the Big Dawg... so do yourself a favor and only ever order the Big Dawg size.\n\nOne downside: If you are traveling south on Central, this place can be a bit of a pain to get to since you have to do a u-turn at the next intersection (just to get over the light rail). If you're going north on Central, however, it's super-easy to drop in real quick, grab a hotdog, and head on your merry way."
0,"This place does not deserve to be called pinks hot dogs. I would give it a -2 if it let me. \nIf you buy a hot dog and cook it yourself it would taste better. \nFor anyone that has been to the original pinks hot dogs in LA, do not eat here. You might just cry. \nPinks is known for their custom hot dog, this place uses the standard/plain hot dog you could probably find at Walmart."
1,"Tonight we went there. We ordered lentils soup, chicken tikka masala and chilli chicken with rice.\nThe soup was nice, with lots of vegetables. The tikka masala actually wasn't my taste. \nThe chilli chicken was the best! Really hot!!! Specially I liked the souce and the vegetables under it. \nWe tried their special bread, it was tasty, too.\nI have to say, I've never tried any authentic Indian restaurant, I was afraid of a bit about the spicy meals, but I liked it. :)\nThe guys were nice, helpful and we got our dishes quickly. \nThe place is recently renovated and it's clean, too.\nWe can pay by card, but it has fee.\nI'm pretty sure we will go back in the future."
1,I really love the Sweet Factory!  They have the yummiest original cocktails sure to satisfy your sweet tooth.  Me and my friend went here for Happy Hour and they have super killer deals.  We had the BBQ Chicken pizza and it was deelish!  Our serer was super sweet (no pun intended) and helpful with helping us choose drinks and food.
1,"Want to have an unforgettable dinner and taste the best food in vegas? This is the place you need to make a reservation in. \n\nLocated on the actual Eiffel Tower in the Paris hotel, this restaurant is an icon in the strip. You are taken in an elevator by a hostess and brought to the bar area of the restaurant where you check in for your table. \n\nIf you call to make reservations be sure to request the fountain view. At night during the weekends the Bellagio fountains play every 15 minutes and you get to experience this great view from your table as you dine. \n\nThe service is impeccable. Once you check in you will wait a few minutes and you can enjoy one of their signature drinks at the bar. \n\nThe setting is low lighting and the noise is average. It's very cozy once you're inside. Dress code is implemented and this is a restaurant where you want to go looking your best. \n\nWhen you are finally  sitting be sure to enjoy the spectacular view that the location offers. \n\nAll the waiters are very knowledgable of the menu and based on your cravings will recommend you a great plate. \n\nAfter placing your order they will come with a big tray of bread and you can chose which you'll like to eat from the variety that they'll bring. \n\nThis occasion I had the beef Wellington and wow!!!! Made to perfection. The outside pastry was crunchy and the filet came medium rare inside. The flavors of the food are out of this world and you never want your plate to be emptied. \n\nFor dessert we ordered the chocolate souffl\u00e9. It wasn't the best we've had but it was pretty good. It was our anniversary dinner and they surprised us with a complimentary chocolate mouse that was very good. \n\nOur second time in Vegas and we HAD to make reservations here again. We're looking forward to going back and again having our signature plates in the best restaurant this city has!"
0,"I found this monogramming place in Dilworth and, although I don't need anything monogrammed at the moment, I wanted to check it out for the future. You walk in and are basically on top of everything; there is a pathway cleared amongst all the items and 2 counters that forces you in and around the store even if you don't want to go. I was immediately looked at as if I were in the wrong place as I had nothing in my hands to be monogrammed, and was quickly and snottily asked if I was dropping anything off. I was stuck behind a gaggle of women debating which Kate Spade purse they wanted done as I desperately tried to get out but could hardly make my way around them. I may try again when I actually have the need for some monogramming, and I will try to overlook the pretentiousness of the employees and clientele."
1,"Having been to the top rated clubs of Vegas such as XS and Pure, I went in with mixed expectation from Rain Nightclub, thanx to Yelp, but Oh My Gawd, what a blast it was..To me Rain Nightclub is by far the best nightclub in Vegas and Palms is the best place to party with their 3 rocking clubs and one chillout lounge. We took the Limo ride to Rain and to our surprise it came with access to all the clubs in palms. Rain is huge, and believe me at one time looking from up above it looked like a Roman Arena with lotta dancing happening down there. Lotta room to dance. Mindbending Techno/House music played by the DJ standing right in front of you. Few excitements like fire popping out from the roof above add to the fun. Multiple levels above the dance floor. Lotta places to move around. Didnt buy any drink there as we had a nice preparty before entering. And when you feel tired of dancing there's always Ghost bar just few floors away to get the beautiful view of the stip. Highly recommended and would go there yet again."
1,"I've visited many CPK's throughout California and Hawaii and since it's a franchise type of restaurant, I wasn't thinking of reviewing it. However, due to the great service we received at the Vegas location, I decided to do a quick review.\nWe arrived about 20 minutes to closing and we were in a bit of a bind because we just walking around the strip and we were hungry. We were tired of buffet type food and wanted to get pizza and salad. We were afraid that we would be told that the restaurant would be closing soon and that only part of the menu would be available. Quite the opposite! We were given top level service. Our waitress was very good and was always around when we needed something.\n\nAs for the food, we had the Thai chicken pizza and the Chicken Caesar salad. My friends had pepperoni and cheese. The food was as good as it is at any of the other CPK's.\n\nGood food, excellent service had us very satisfied with our experience there. Best of all, the restrooms were very clean! (That's hard to come by nowadays).\n5 stars for the food, service, and the cleanliness of the restrooms. Good job CPK Las Vegas!"
1,"I would have given Avalon 5 stars, but they messed up on the bill and it was awkward.\n\nEverything else was great... really good...\n\nPlenty of parking... Decor is sleek..... Service was perfect, except for messing up the check.... Bus boy was always filling the water....The food was AMAZING.... It really was almost perfect.\n\nSo we ordered several sides and a couple main courses.\n\nThey start you out with bread, which seems homemade. They provide a cranberry butter... Awesome....\n\nThe sides were tasty, warm and we wanted more...\n\nThe entrees are a good size.... cooked perfectly.... filling... and looked amazing...\n\nI think we might go back when we are in Arizona again....\n\nI really wanted to give this place 5 stars, but it was awkward when they messed up the bill.. They did fix it.... but....."
1,Wonderful meal! It was absolutely delicious. Such a friendly wait staff and bar staff. It was a little taste of home! I would definitely recommend to everyone!
0,"if you i can give this negative rating, i will. bad customer service. dirty food. don't come here."
0,"I came here March 26 because I love Sushi. I was very disappointed in the service. We had a blonde woman server, Jenny, and she hardly came to our table. Soup was cold and I had to reach over to the next empty table to get soy sauce. Food was good, just hope you don't get Jenny."
0,"Worst service ever! Went here a few weeks ago about an hour and a halfway before they closed and got treated horribly ! I asked if we could get an appetizer and our writer replies with \""we'll what do you want? The kitchens closing soon\"" we got up and left right then. Also had a hair in my water. Never coming here again !!"
0,"The star rating is not what I want to give David's because I typically enjoy their food. However the only way I have found to eat David's is in the physical restaurant itself. \n\nI've ordered delivery from here a few times and it's never good. I just got cheese fries and a burger and I can't even eat the burger because the bun is so soggy and same kent the fries. Both are soggy, cold and not edible. \n\nI felt bad for the delivery guy so I still threw him a bad tip even though it took over a hour to get here when they told us 35 minutes.\n\nPretty bummed about David's right now"
0,"Don't bother stepping foot into this place if you value your time. Customer service leaves a lot to be desired, and I just finished waiting over two hours to get a small leak repaired. AVOID THIS STORE"
0,"went to Geno's for the first time at I have to say it will be my last.   We ordered the provolone cheese steak sandwich, gyro and fries. The meal cost around $20 so its pretty expensive for casual dining. The \""cheese \"" steak was the absolute worst I've ever had. The cheese was non exsistant barely even there, the roll was soggy and cheap quality and the meat if it was meat was closer to canned dog food then steak. The gyro is also horrible. The meat was thin and tasteless, the pita was store bought and generic. The fries are junk too. I have no idea how this place stays in business but. What I do know is its not getting anymore of mine. If you have taste buds then geno's is not the place to go to. 1 star is too high a rating."
0,"I only went because it was my moms birthday. She chose famous Dave's. Not sure why it's so popular, it's not good. It's not just this location. I've been to a few other locations and I'm never impressed. \nMy boyfriend ordered the burnt end sandwich because we know we don't care for their ribs. It was very dry and tough. Kids got a 2 meat plate with ribs and chicken fingers. They wouldn't eat the fingers because the said it tasted weird. Thinking they were just being picky I tried one. I'm not sure what all the put in the batter but something tasted kinda like perfume. It was a weird taste, couldn't be mad at them for not wanting to eat it. \nThe Cajun chicken sandwich I got was ok. It came with a sauce, lettuce, tomato and their devil pickles."
0,"This is the worst company ever. They have managed to make a wonderful experience a nightmare. No follow up. We call they say\"" oh we will get back to you\"" we promise. \nCustomer service is lacking big time. I have a pile of dirt in front of my garage for a month. They keep telling us someone is coming to pick it up. I know a friend of mine who has gotten an estimate and has not signed yet. I hope I can talk her out of using this company."
1,"This is now my favorite hotel in Vegas! I stayed here twice early last year and fell in love. This place is a fresh change from the older themed hotels and has some fabulous restaurants (see my other reviews of Scarpetta and Holstein's). We put the concierge to the test upon our arrival as one of my trips was on Valentine's Day and we arrived without dinner plans. The concierge successfully booked us tickets to Zumanity and reservations for Scarpetta without any problems and we had a fabulous evening. \n\nWhat about the rooms you ask? Awesome. We were upgraded to one of the rooms with a kitchen and balcony with a view of the strip. They even have corner rooms available with views of the Bellagio fountains. Definitely the trendiest new hotel on the strip in my opinion. \n\nThe only reason I'm not giving them five stars is because I think they still had some kinks to work out, but that's to be expected with a new property. I'll definitely be coming back to this property for many more visits."
0,We recently debated if you'd come back to a place for good food but bad service or bad food and great service. Answer found here - service doesn't win out over bad food. Too salty. Ckn tacos were limp greasy tortillas filled with mashed bland chicken - looked like baby food. Rice dreadful. Chimichanga the size of a small enchilada. Do people really wait in line in so phx for this?  Too many good alternatives to come here twice.  And we're usually pretty forgiving...
1,"LOVED our evening there! I went with a large group so I got to see a taste a few things. Everything was great, and they had a couple nice wines for us to discover. I suspect that the bill for our group was quite a lot but I would definitely go there again."
0,"Of the 3 scheduled appointments I have made to this banfield, they have been at minimum 30 minutes late each time (the longest being an hour).  Again, these were not walk-ins but scheduled appointments.  Once, I can understand, stuff happens.  But three times and you've got a systemic problem that needs addressing. \n\nI wish I could say that it's due to incredible bedside service. But I suspect that it's due to poor scheduling and staff utilization."
1,"PAUL, my hero, my barber.\n\nFor years and years, he has taken care of me with his consistent, immaculate fades.  Why would I ever need to go anywhere else?  Well, I guess when Paul goes on vacation, Max, Tony and Roman are always ready and have all the skills and tools necessary to deliver any kind of cut.\n\nWalk-ins only.  Comfortable and plentiful seating.  Can get REALLY busy at peak times, but worth the wait.  Sports, Spike, or A&E are always on the flatscreen TVs they have mounted over the mirrors."
0,"If you are from out of town, do not come here. The fact that a suggestion by a male clerk who initially said my insurance was a no go in his office then suggested that I call my insurance to make sure I will be covered left a bad taste in my mouth . I went to this place because of their 4+ rating on yelp. I left the office without being checked out. I know for a fact that my insurance should have been accepted because I call my provider after I left. I believe that's why they have insurance specialist working for them. Or do they?FYI if you are going to talk about someone's insurance statues. Make sure other people don't hear the conversations u are having with the patient or the other clerks comments about a patients insurance status. Very unprofessional ."
1,We attended the 4:00 showing and we were simply amazed! Lots and lots of audience participation. I do not agree with the reviews of him going through the motions - I read all those before and almost chose not to go but I am go glad I decided to go! You will leave just astonished and wanting to see more! Loved it! Highly reccommend the show :)
1,"Wow! one of the best italian restaurants I've been to in Vegas.\n\nFirst of all, I must say the service here is GREAT!  The servers made sure you had everything you needed.  Even though it was a busy night, the servers did not disappoint.\n\nThe food was delicious!  I really recommend the \""Scialatielli Ai Quattro Passi\"" pasta.  It's a thick pasta, kinda like really fat spaghetti with a bolognese red sauce.  The pasta was cooked al dente and the sauce was tossed and combined with the pasta perfectly.  The portions was huge and was definitely sharable.\n\nThe grilled pork chop and honey glazed belly was very good also.  They usually cook the pork chop to medium, which is a little rare for my taste.  I would ask for medium well or well.  This dish could be a tad sweet with the glaze and the apple marmalade.  But overall, the flavors combine nicely with the saltiness of the chop and the sweetness of the glaze.  The chop can be a on the fatty side so beware.\n\nThe \""Salsiccia & Broccoli\"" pizza was on the bland side.  The home made sausage had a mild flavor which didn't work too well with the pizza.  The Rapini/Broccoli was more bitter than I expected.  This was the only disappointment, though I'm sure the other pizzas have potential to be yummy.  \n\nIf you still have room for dessert, you must have the Tiramisu.  I usually don't like tiramisu made with lady fingers because it's usually dry.  But this was one of the better tiramisu's I've had.  It had the right amount of coffee flavor, richness from the cheese, and sweetness from the chocolate glaze.\n\nOverall, this was VERY pleasant meal and can't wait to come back."
1,"This is the absolute best burger joint I've ever been to in my entire life. The burgers aren't big like the burgers at fancy restaurants, but they're better this way. The buns are crispy on the inside. The patties are tender and crunchy on the outside. The ingredients are tasty and fresh. The chencho fries, my god, those chencho fries are immaculate. Just go already, you won't regret it."
0,"Beware physically challenged people! The policy of Caesars Palace is that if you are physically challenged and using a cane, a Walker , or a wheelchair, you will be allowed in by yourself, however if you are with somebody else they will have to pay an additional $20 to go through the handicap line with you. This can be very problematic, especially if you are a diabetic and have to eat at a certain time with medications and insulin. I can see this for presenting a problem in light of the expense of the meal. The additional $20 is ridiculous when you consider the cost of a meal itself . I guess Caesars is going to go broke if they don't charge that extra $20 . I guess most people wouldn't have much sympathy, seeing as \nthis means somebody would jump the line , but in most cases we would only have one additional person with us as a helper .\nI consider this highway robbery, and will not be spending my dollars at Caesars again!\nSure the food is great there, but there is so many other buffets in town of close or equal value and quality that do assist the handicapped that it is not worth they extra money and time."
0,"I was in the casino about 1 month ago. I will never go back!!  I wanted to play 21, there was two empty seats so I went over to one of them and the dealer told me someone was seating there so I went to the other one and the person next to that seat told me someone was seating there also. I was there with three other people who saw what was going on. The dealer saw I was not alone so she then said the seat was avelable.  I don't know what the dealer problem was but I will never be back the that casino. We were hoping with the the new ownership things would be better, I guss not.\n\nMary Eugenio"
1,The hotel rooms are big like where you can have a small party in the room. The beds are soft and comfy. Casino is cool. A good variety of restaurants. I enjoyed staying there.
0,"Good location right next to Walmart, it really wasn't that packed for a Sunday afternoon. We were seated quick and easy with no hassle. Our server Michael was really good; he knew a great deal of the menu and was responsible enough to make sure all our needs were meet and was really good with the kids. Our server was very lenient with us and our order; cheerful happy and professional. I had biscuits and gravy blueberry pancakes and a steak omelet; I know I'm a fatty!! Lol!!  We sat near the kitchen and staff was a bit loud and lots of plates and glasses rattling and banging around.Yet I sort of lost my appetite the place needs a serious remodel and cleaning. The booth back splash had coffee stains and crayon marking all over the wall which made me look around a bit more. The wall just above us was covered in a thick layer of dust like nobody cleaned these wall in months and the vent just above us was dirty as well covered in thick black mold. This is all pretty scary sitting with my food just above all this dust and mold. Place has potential but they need to clean up their act, better yet just clean up.  Our server MICHAEL WAS GOOD!! You can be extremely great somewhere else!!"
0,"THIS PLACE IS EXPENSIVE!!! omg, i definitely can't here in on my budget. thank goodness my uncle was paying. \n\ni felt like a fish outta water cuz we were the only asians in the restaurant. \n\nmy uncle ordered a bottle of wine, and my glass wasn't taken away and i wasn't even carded. and i was under 21 at the time. good for me though. \n\ni think i ordered the filet mignon. it just came out, ungarnished, on a plate. just a piece of meat on a white plate. ugliest presentation ever! couldn't even bother to put a lil parsley or something on it. it made it look very unappetizing. and the meat was nothing special."
1,"Le menu est vari\u00e9. Il y a des plats travaill\u00e9s comme l'osso-bucco, le foie de veau, les rognons, etc...\nJ'ai pris la table d'h\u00f4te avec la salade au balsamique. Simple et bon. Ensuite, j'ai pris les lasagnes \u00e0 la viande effiloch\u00e9e \u00e0 l'huile d'olive et parmesan. Tr\u00e8s bon mais j'aurais aim\u00e9 go\u00fbter un peu plus le parmesan. Le dessert : un g\u00e2teau au fromage (tr\u00e8s bien) mais j'ai pr\u00e9f\u00e9r\u00e9 le dessert de ma femme (une tarte au pomme avec de la cr\u00e8me glac\u00e9e semifredo et une sauce au caramel, genre de tarte tatin un peu)\nLe tiramisu de mon ami par contre n'en \u00e9tait pas un.

1,"We found Babbo on Yelp and decided to try it on Tuesday for spaghetti and meatballs @ $5.99.  The arugula and bean salad was delicious and the spaghetti was tasty. \n\nIt was a little noisy, but the server was pleasant and helpful. We will definitely come back."
1,"We go to Las Vegas every 3-4 months. For  an off Strip hotel, we usually stay at The Orleans.  We like this place, especially for a good local and friendly atmosphere. There is a good variety of restaurants and the drinks are inexpensive.  The room we stayed  is always good and clean, and the bed is very comfortable. My only suggestion is that you should ask for a room not too far from the elevator or you might have to walk a long way to your room. That's only because of the layout of the hotel."
0,"We usually board our dogs with our family veterinary practice.  Last week, we decided to give Pet Paradise a try.  We toured the facility beforehand and asked a lot of questions to make sure the environment was well suited for our babies.  We had them with Pet Paradise for five nights before receiving that dreaded phone call that there had been an accident.  \n\nSomehow (big question mark) an unaltered male dog was able to bite one of my dogs ears off.  Yes.  You read that correctly.  My dog is now missing a chunk of his ear.  The odd part is that it wasn't during play time.  All of the dogs were seemingly safe in their own confined areas.  How did this happen?  We were told it was a freak accident.  That doesn't make us feel better.  \n\nThey did the right thing by getting him emergency veterinary care and even footed the bill.  The manager had no problem charging us for the entire stay and didn't even offer us a discount even though we left the facility with one dog missing a chunk of his ear with several bite wounds on his head and other ear.\n\nNeedless to say, even though accidents happen, this one shouldn't have.  We will continue to use our local family veterinary facility for boarding in the future.  Less frills, but we bring them home the way we dropped them off."
0,"Thumbs down.  The service was good, but the food just wasn't up to par.  :("
1,"After scouring Yelp for places to take my craft beer lovin' girlfriend for her going away dinner, I ended finding Draft House and it was absolutely perfect. \n\nWe rolled in at about 8:15pm on a Saturday night and were seated immediately. This place is HUGE. Two levels with a couple of pool tables, darts, and shuffle board. The beer selection is ridonkulous. 96 beers and a full bar to quench every alcoholic's thirst. \n\nOur waitress was my least favorite part of the night. Immediately, you could tell that she didn't want to be there. She was unpleasant and not very friendly at all. She basically took our order and sauntered off.\n\nThe food however was amazingggg. My beau and I had the sliders (cheeseburger & cheesesteak) and both were fantastic. My girls had the grilled cheeses and a caprese salad, all very very good. \n\nOverall, Draft House is pretty dope. The drinks were good, the beer selection was obviously up to par. I look forward to coming back here with my beer guzzlin' peeps and shooting some pool soon!"
1,"I had to try this place from recommendations from a fellow co-worker.  the outside is very underestimating as the inside is on a whole other level. It is comfy, cozy, and the music is awesome. keeps a positive train of thought as you wait for your pizza. the wait was long but expected as they make the pizza right in front of you.. Literally they have a glass wall and you can watch them make the pizza. I had no problems waiting as the final product was ridiculous! ! we had the 18\"" with cheese, eggplant, caramelized onions, sauteed mushrooms, roasted garlic, pepperoni, and olives. along with their garlic rosemary knots. the pizza was great, the marinara sauce was very flavorful but not overpowering.  the mozzarella cheese tasted fresh, the toppings were very flavorful and did not disappoint at all! pizza was on another level from others ive tried in my opinion and is highly recommended. the garlic rosemary knots are awesome. the knots are a bit dense and tough but after all it is a knot lol! but I didnt mind as the garlic and rosemary was very intense and was a great surprise as the knots ive had around town fall way short on the flavor category, not these though! They are perfect and a must try with their pizza. oh I also ordered their cannoli and I am currently waiting to try them as I am stuffed!! we finished half the pizza and there was two of us and I am satisfied! ! if you like pizza and havent tried this place, put your usual pizza spot on hold for once and go here it will not dissapoint!!\n\nUpdate: so I had the cannoli!  It was good. It did however taste like a twist on what a canoli im used to taste like. It has the look. The shell is good and crispy, very dense shell. The filling to me tasted like a cream cheese/ cinnamon cream filling. It was good, just not what I expected. Try it out and let me know what you all think??"
0,"Stopped in yesterday for a quick lunch with the kids after a visit to the Science Center.  The service was TERRIBLE.  Worst experience as a mom ever!!  The waitress, Abriana, did not have customer service skills whatsoever.  Our orders came out incorrect, figures since she didn't even write them down.  After we informed her that the orders were wrong, she proceeded to tell us that we were wrong and this is what we ordered.  Kids have been waiting almost 35 minutes for the food now.  We had the manager come over.  He apologized for the error and waited on us the rest of the visit. Food was good, but the service was not up to par.  We would not go back."
1,"Armandos...our new go-to Mexican joint!!  The Muchacaka burrito and the Huevos Ranchero burrito were simply delicious!\n\nThe manager checked with me prior to leaving on a take away order to make sure everything was in order......excellent excellent customer service.\n\nI have read some of the negative reviews on Armando's and I am left scratching my head especially by the 1 star review on 4/1/2011......A very mindless and naive review....if your going to rip someones business then take the time to tell them what needs to be worked on.\n\nThe hot sauce is very tasty, very spicy and is fairly vinegary which was a refreshing change.  The flour tortillas are the kind that are a bit translucent from all that great lard used in the making of......"
0,My buddy and I tend to eat here on our Vegas outbound travel days.  We do this because it's a convenient stop on the way to the airport.  We don't do this because the food is great (it isn't) and we don't do this because the service is great (it isn't).  I think the food is meh and the prices are high for what they serve.  We need to find a better place to eat on the way to the airport.
1,It's so pretty in here. They have a good selection but everything is pricey. If you don't have a Fry's rewards card I suggest getting one. We used my aunt's number since we don't live in AZ. At least this way she'll get the fuel points and I got the discount.
1,I've always had good service here and was so thrilled when they opened since it meant I no longer had to drive to Maryland Parkway for some good ube macapuno cake. The quality is usually consistently good with the rare hiccup. I love that they have individual cake slices in a variety of flavors when I just want a little bit or I'm craving a selection.
1,"Why did I wait so long to stop by Laurel Market? Who knows, because this place is fantastic! \n\nConveniently located off of South Blvd., Laurel Market's menu is chock full of sandwiches of all types - for breakfast, lunch, veg heads, meat lovers, etc. Make sure you pay attention to their deli hours (7 am-3 pm, Mon-Sat) so you don't miss out on a delish breakfast burrito or deli sandwich. And, as others have noted, there are only a few tables out front to hang out and eat - so don't be surprised if you have to take your goods to go. \n\nI tried the CAST sandwich - freshly sliced turkey, green apple, cheddar, honey mustard & lettuce stuffed between two slices of sourdough (my choice of bread). It was super tasty, full of sinus-clearing honey mustard  and plenty of sandwich. With a bag of chips, a can of rootbeer, my big lunch amounted to $9.90. Suffice it to say, I made a meal and a half out of it. \n\nWhile you're there, check out the other goods - plenty of chips and accompaniments, massive \""Cowboy\"" cookies, beverages, a smattering of wine and beer, and more. The staff here are extremely sweet and want to make sure you get exactly what you're looking for. Plus - they offer catering! \n\nI'm absolutely looking forward to stopping by Laurel Market soon to try out more of their sandwich menu and perhaps score a famed breakfast burrito!"
1,"Lately I've been going to eat to places that have 4-5 stars and everyone raves about them!! And just like when someone tells me that a movie is the best ever!!!!  my expectations are very high, I watch it and more often that not, I'm disappointed. \n\nI'm glad to say that Capriotti's didn't disappointed me at all! I had a Capistrami and it was delicious! Also, it was the smaller size (9inches) and it was huge! Big enough to share, but being that I was very hungry and I don't like to save a sandwich with coleslaw for later....well, I ate it all!  \nI agree though with other reviews that mentioned the bread could be better. Luckily the great filling made up for the not as great bread.\n\nService was good and the guys behind the counter were very nice as well.\n\nThe price is fair since the sandwiches are huge. \n\nI'll definitely come back to try other sandwiches."
1,"After at least a half dozen manicures, a couple pedicures and an eyebrow wax at Serenity,  it is time to do an update. I am still happy with the manicures I get here and do not go anywhere else, however there are a few things that prevent my from bumping Serenity up to 5 star status.\n\nOne of the reasons I like Serenity as much as I do is because they offer gel manicures at rock bottom prices, and they are quality manicures that last a minimum of two weeks every time. However, as with many of the cheaper salons on town, customer service can be a little lacking here. Sometimes I am offered water, others times I am not. There have been times I have asked for additional services (usually an eyebrow wax) and it was forgotten because techs are in a hurry to move on to the next client. \n\nOn my last visit I made sure to remind the tech I wanted an eyebrow wax. I should have just let her forget. While the manicures here are on point the brow shaping is not. \n\nOne thing I do like a lot about Serenity is that every tech I have had has done the same, high quality job on my nails, and I have had a different tech almost every time I have gone in. I will continue to frequent Serenity every 2-3 weeks for my gel manicures and recommend that others in the area do as well. Just skip the waxing.\n\nEDIT: I now see Moon exclusively for my nails. She is awesome"
1,Super food and good ambiance.
1,"Rich did a great and thorough job with our home inspection.  Back in June of this year, he did a home inspection of the interior and exterior of the home. . The inspection report he prepared was very informative and simple to navigate.  Because of his inspection and report, we were able to resolve a few small issues before they became bigger issues."
1,"The food here was much better than I expected considering it was tucked away in TI. I ordered the seafood pho since it's harder to find normally. The noodles were a little thicker and chewier than usual which I liked a lot. At first I thought I got jipped with a few shrimp and pieces of imitation crab from what I saw floating on top, but there was a ton of seafood hidden underneath the noodles. Even though it's not the best value for $17, I was really satisfied."
1,"Have you ever had a vision of how you think something will be, and the reality isn't what you thought it would be? Well, I think that may have been a bit of my problem with The Parlor. After reading the reviews of this place on here (and I trust y'all!) I was very excited to visit the Parlor for my birthday dinner Thursday. \n\nSooo...\n\nThe good: the pizzas were amazing! We had the Yukon Gold and the seafood pizza and both were delicious. Maybe not as great as Pizzeria Bianco, but we also didn't have to wait 3 hours. We sat on the patio (yes, in July! it wasn't bad at all). Also, as some previous reviews have mentioned, they have PBR on draft....which made me giggle. \n\nThe \""meh\"" (I won't say anything was bad about this place, but just meh) The service was pretty slow, and the server not super friendly. She wasn't rude, but just sorta lackadaisical. The appetizer (meat and cheese plate) was really small for 4 people (and we asked if it would be enough) Seriously, we each got one piece of prosciutto, one square of pita, and some cheese. We also had the ginger martini, which the server recommended, and it was basically a shot in a martini glass for $11. \n\nOverall, I would go back, but it wouldn't be my first choice. However, it is a great addition to the downtown Phoenix/Biltmore circuit, and I definitely would have their pizza again!"
1,"Finally found the time to check this place out after hearing many good things about it.  Upon first glance, I wanted to get back in my car and speed away.  Interior is pretty basic and bare bone but the food!!!!!!  *JESUS*  Was amazing!  I love the amount of vegetables that came with the pho, great service, and a great price.  Might take the #1 spot on my pho spots in Charlotte list!"
0,"I wanted to like this place. It's close to my house, decent prices, really friendly, and they do a nice job. But, it doesn't seem to matter whether you make an appointment or not. They are always under staffed, even despite the fact that they are never that busy. I gave them several chances but after having to wait 30 or more minutes even though having an appointment 3 times, then actually attempting to send me to their Indian School location ( I had an appointment at the McDonald location) I decided it wasn't worth it. I won't be returning."
1,"I was looking to get my windows tinted and came across DC Auto on Yelp .After seeing their awesome ratings I decided to stop in one day to ask about the different films they offer. I was shown their Heatwall which demonstrates the different films they offer and allows you to feel how much heat comes through each kind of film. I made an appointment for a couple days later. \n\nWhen I came in for my appointment, they confirmed what kind of film I wanted and escorted me to their waiting area. I was so impressed with how nice it was. They have a fridge with sodas and waters, coffee, and snacks. There is magazines and a flat screen TV. They also offer Wifi and have a conference center. I was quoted 3 hours for my car but they had it done in 2. \n\nWhen my car was finished, David showed me my vehicle and it looked amazing. He went over their no fault warranty with me. I told him that I found them on Yelp and he made sure that I received the 10% Yelp discount. \n\nDon't waste your time with Groupon offers for other places to get mediocre service and tint. This place offers excellent customer service, a nice waiting area with amenities while you wait for your vehicle, and a product they take pride in and that you'll be completely satisfied with. \n\nThank you DC Auto for the fantastic service. I will be sure to bring my next car here and refer everyone I know here."
0,"Out of everything! And there was barely any food selection to begin with. I got a quesadilla. Sub par. Sammy Hagar wasn't even there. I doubt he's ever eaten the food there. I mean it's got Sammy Hagar's name on it, I expected better."
0,"Was one of my favorite places for breakfast.  However, my last two visits have been very disappointing.  The first time my breakfast took  a long time to receive and when it got there bacon was almost uncooked, hash browns were burnt, and eggs were dried up.  When I complained they said they had a new cook.  Next time I went (about 10 days later) a worse outcome.  Took 30 minutes to get (on a Friday at about 10:45) and the bacon arrived raw, eggs dry and cut up into tiny pieces, hash browns cold and toast burnt.  I told the server it was unacceptable and she offered to take it back.  I told her forget it and I left.  I don't know what happened but I won't be returning."
1,"Sure, the outdoor seating is quite pleasant when the climate agrees. Absolutely, the seitan tacos are a great substitution to a carnivore diet (this coming from a near meatatarian). Undoubtedly, their combination of brunch and mexican cuisines is tasty and filling. Remarkably, their salsas/sauces/guac are all fresh, delicious, and worth licking the bowl for the last bits.\n\nBut the real reason I'll go back? The booze.\n\nI know what you're thinking - that pseudo-alcoholic from the Midwest is at it again, overlooking what really makes a place great and just going straight for the bottle. But this place is for real. I enjoyed a bloody mary during a Sunday brunch that not only cured a hangover but almost paved the road for the start of a second hangover. My brunch mate slurped down a mojito of sorts that flavorful and strong, much to her delight. Despite the strength of said potions, they were still quite tasty. My only complaint is that I couldn't slog mine down fast enough to enjoy it ice cold in its entirety. I have also enjoyed some sort of spicy martini, another non-spicy martini, and something involving fruit and tequila - while I apologize for not remembering the specifics (see: sentence #1 of this paragraph), I will assure you that everything was enjoyable and strong enough to make a bull lose balance.\n\nThe only complaint I have about this place is that it seems slightly overpriced. I know it is the only decent place of its kind in the area, but their prices signify that they also know it and are using it to their advantage. Also, the vibe can border on the pretentious depending on the crowd, but I would say in general from my visits and peer-ins from the street that the crowd isn't much of a worry. \n\nOverall, and this kind of goes without saying, I'll be back. What can I say - some of us love the sauce, whichever variety it may be."
1,"i came here for lunch today after checking out from Aria and it was my first time, but it was so good. I wasn't even hungry but still managed to scarf down two tacos. The guy slicing our meat was super friendly and nice... that made me love the place even more. \n\nI asked my bf to get me foil so i could save my last taco for the car ride home. While I was attempting to wrap it, one of the lady's that worked there came by and helped me, but because I'm dumb I thought the shiny side of the foil was suppose to be covered... apparently I'm wrong! She took my tacos and had the guy wrap it for me. \n\nthat's what i call customer service, and it left me with a smile. i hope they read my review and know that I really appreciate great customer service. I never asked for help but she passed by and just helped me... like so motherly!!\n\ncome here, you won't regret it!! the workers all looked so happy and really nice. in LA a lot of taco establishments are kind of nerve wrecking to walk in especially some of the king taco's I've been to."
1,"This place is a great find! The lunch prices are very reasonable and such great quantity and quality (I am very picky with food and quality). They could use a better lettuce than iceberg but that is my only request to change. Apparently, they opened in 2010 and I have been missing out.... missing out no longer. Great food and nice owners and staff. Scandinavian food is on!"
0,Worst place ever. Sat there for 10 minutes with my 3 year old son and no one came to the table. 2 groups of people got helped who walked in after us. So worst service ever. Need to work on greeting people. The place wasn't even busy. I give this place a zero
1,"I have had several massages here in Phoenix, but hands down, this was by far the BEST.  An added bonus...it's completely reasonable price-wise!"
1,I have a Simplicity vacuum and took it Vac & Sew to get an estimate.  Mark greeted me and I explained I needed a tune up and he said a full estimate was free.  We agreed on a do not exceed price and it was completely refurbished for slightly more.  An excellent job for a fair and reasonable price.  I highly recommend this place for all vacuums.
1,"Definitely a fan of this unmarked, unpretentious downtown dive.  Exceptional menu and carefully crafted creations... my favorites?  Devil's Eggs w/ Caviar & Pancetta, CRISPY chicken skin and BACON JAM.  Amazing service and menu.  Hi-5 to this concept... can't wait till the balcony is open.  I'll be seeing you Carson."
0,"Mehhhh.\n\nMaybe it's my fault (ok, it's completely my fault) for ordering the heat-attack slice from hell. Pepperoni, ham, sausage and bacon layered between bread and a hearty helping of cheese topped with more bacon, but it was a bit too much. Difficult to eat and just tasted like salty grease. I've eaten a meatlovers before but this slice....I don't know....it just didn't taste good. Which is saying alot because bad pizza is still pizza. I'll have to go back and try one of their less meatier slices."
1,"Amazing!!!   Finally got in to check this place out!  The service was phenomenal (Server-Elizabeth), the ambiance is unparalleled especially for a Mexican restaurant, and the food was awesome!  Be sure to try the \""De La Tierra\"" for the table!   It's enough for 3-4 ppl or two very hungry people.  For drinks, try \""The Office!\"""
0,"Well...I wouldn't get the dragon lady roll again but the shumai were good, and the rainbow roll was good.  Too many mayo/cream cheese rolls on that menu. Not even busy on a Sunday night with the BCS game in town.  Nice atmosphere."
0,"We so wanted to love this place! \n\nIt was our only big dinner out on our quick trip to Vegas. I had enjoyed a lunch at Craft in Century City a year ago, and we are big fans of Top Chef. Too bad the quality that Tom C. expects on that show has been left to wither at Craftsteak. \n\nIt started with being seated next to a server station. Of course most everyone is since they put it right in the middle of each dining section. The back to the chair in which my dining partner was sitting was broken. It took standing up and physically trying a nearby empty chair to get any attention. \n\nIt also took us some time before we realized that we were being served by a \""team\"". Usually roles are clear when there are multiple servers. Here there was no head waiter, just two completely uncoordinated partners. One would ask if we wanted to be walked through the menu. We said, \""no thanks.\"" Then the other waiter swung by and launched into an in depth description without asking. When asked if I wanted to keep the wine list, I said, \""yes, thank you.\"" Then the other waiter came by and took it away without asking. More to the point, one of the two had no idea or ability to articulate what came with the shellfish sampler. It took asking three times to get to the fact that there was lobster, and another few questions to confirm that it was in a salad mixture of some sort. Icing on the cake: the busboy soaked us with his table rag while cleaning the table next to us. Gross. \n\nBottom line: this is not service worthy of the reputation or the price tag. \n\nThe food was a great big MEH. Here's the quick breakdown:\n\nWagyu tartare - delicious, but not the best I've had. Prefer the traditional French bistro/brasserie preparation.\nFried zucchini blossoms - terrible. Turned one of my favorite sides/apps into piles of greasy, deep fried breading. Blossoms practically unrecognizable. \nRibeye - very tasty, well cooked, right on the money.\nStrip - fine, but not remarkable.\nRisotto w/peas and shrooms - delicious, perfectly al dente and creamy.\nRamps & morels - ok, but uber salty.\nSnow peas - delicious! fresh and crispy.\nAu gratin - mediocre\n\nHad a Pinot Noir and a Cab by the glass. Both were overpriced, but good.\n\nFirst time I've left 15% gratuity in a long time. And I even backed out the tax before making my calculation. \n\nWe'd say that we hoped you'd clean up your act, but it is quite clear that you've sacrificed quality to maximize cashing in on celebrity and notoriety with this clip joint."
0,"I recently was contacted by the proprietors of Jimmy's of Chicago and here is the content of their response to my post. Fair and balanced reporting is what I'm all about so I'm giving them a voice. I have to say that their willingness to address the issue and ask for another chance at my business is admirable and we might just check them out again soon. I'll keep you all posted as to my experiences there. Here is their response in its entirety:\n\nDear Mr. Shields,\n\nI am sorry to hear that you did not enjoy your dinner here at our restaurant.  I wish you would have shared your concerns with us while you were here as it is of utmost importance to us that all of our guests have a wonderful experience.  We recieve many compliments on our veal dishes and especially on the lasagna.  In fact, the lasagna is one of our best sellers.  Obviously, people have different tastes and perhaps the items you chose are not made in the fashion to which you are accustomed.  We would love you to give us another chance as I think your experience would be much different.  If you are willing to do so, please introduce yourself to either me (Kerry) or my wife (Zalena). We have many regulars who come several times a week and we hope that you and your wife might become one of those.  If not, thank you for your past patronage.  \n\nSincerely,\n\nKerry and Zalena Kersting"
1,"LUX has the best coffee in town hands down. I've been to nearly all of the local coffee shops in Phoenix. I'm a complete addict. I work out of coffee shops and despite what some of these other folks say they observe I actually get more work done here than most other shops. I think the loudness and business of the place does it for me. Kind of like working out of the eXtreme Bean in Tempe.\n\nAny way, no other shop makes a white mocha (velvet) like Lux. Do yourself a favor and order a regular velvet mocha for here with their fresh homemade espresso whipped cream. Additionally, all of the pastries you see there are freshly baked in house too.\n\nSo good."
1,OK so you can't beat their 5 buck lunch specials. Now don't go in expecting awesome Greek food but it sure beats the hell out of subway for lunch. \n\nHappy hour is great the service has been awesome... You just gained a star THANKS!
0,"PSA: I don't eat red meat, so take this review for what you will.\n\nI was recently in Sin City for work and we had our department dinner at Burger Brasserie. We were a large group, so I feel slightly bad for giving criticism, but the service was painfully slow. Some of my coworkers were on their second drink while others hadn't even gotten their first, many of the food orders took a long time (possibly misplaced?), and our server never asked if we wanted additional drinks.\n\nBeyond the service, I found the food to be just blah. Once again, read someone else's review regarding their burgers, but as for their appetizer platter, french fries, shrimp Caesar salad, and tomato bisque soup, I was unimpressed. The appetizers were average (yet obviously cost double since it's Vegas) and my \""tomato bisque soup\"" had to have been marinara sauce. My coworker even said it tasted like the same sauce she got with her fries. The only positive note for the food was that their shrimp was surprisingly delicious.\n\nI don't often give negative reviews, but I just can't get on board with Burger Brasserie."
1,"On my first night in Montreal, I was much later than the rest of my party due to a long wait at the border. As such, they had eaten already and I had not. The concierge at my hotel that suggested that we try this place that was right around the corner to please all.  His comment, \""you won't be disappointed.\""  He was right.  \n\nFor a purportedly famous place, this wasn't half bad.  It's billed as a jazz and dinner club with live jazz music every night it's open.  First off, the place was small which gave it an intimate feel.  It was full but but not crowded and we didn't have to wait for a seat (of course we was there on a late evening on Thursday too).  Being the only one in my party who was eating, we sat at the bar which didn't have great views of the stage.  This didn't bother me because I don't go to SEE jazz, I go to HEAR jazz and the club has great acoustics.  The tables (with few exceptions) have good stage views.  Table space is at a premium, BTW.  The jazz was a blues-jazz type improv group and was great.  Regardless of whether you eat or not, it's a $5 cover charge for shows.\n\nAs for the food, the menu was mostly salads and barbeque chicken and pork ribs.  Now I am a vegetarian, but when the wait staff says their best dish is the chicken and pork ribs combo, by golly, I'll have the chicken and pork ribs combo.  And for someone who hasn't eaten meat in the last 15 years, it wasn't a bad way to fall off the wagon.  The pork was falling off the bone, the chicken was succulent and the portions were enough for two people.  The ribs are barbeque'd Memphis-style with a brown sugar and tomato based glaze and the chicken is grilled with the a less sweet barbeque sauce on the side.  The club's decor is funky and seedy: they have crystal chandeliers and old brass instruments on the wall with endless paintings.  The dress code: Montreal nice (chic dresses or skirts for the ladies, button down shirts and slacks for the men; no sneakers).  The prices were downside:  the entree was $25-30/plate, add on a drink ($7), the $5 cover charge and tax, and the bill was a hair over $45...for one person.  Not what I normally would have spent on one meal during a casual night out.\n\nWould I eat there again? No. Why? I'm just not that into meat.  Would I go again for the show?  Absolutely; even on the off nights, the jazz is white hot."

0,HELLO!\nIt is a PAWN SHOP\nNo different than any other PAWN SHOP\nJust maybe more expensive AND \nwith a LONG LINE OUTSIDE\nOnly go there if you love their show....
0,This place is closed...says there will be a family Italian place going in.
1,"My first experience of Comme Ca was New Year's Eve 2010.  From very attentive service to a wide variety of French bistro food this is a place for your must see list in Las Vegas.  Located in the new Cosmopolitan next to CityCenter and Bellagio, Comme Ca also overlooks the Strip with incredible view points.  \n\nTry the Turbo fish.  Was told by the waiter this fish is indigenous to the waters of Northern France and the way it's prepared at Comme Ca will make you want to come back for more.  Lobster salad to a variety of beets add to the amazing variety of dishes offered.\n\nFor those desert fans, the creme brulee was outstanding.\n\nOn our departure the Comme Ca manager asked about the service and food.  You don't get that level of attention very often is restaurants.  He was genuinely interested in our feedback and that experience was one more reason to make Comme Ca my restaurant of choice."
1,"This is definitely one of my newest faves for sweets in Vegas! Lovely selection of cakes, gelatos, sandwiches, pastries, and chocolates! They also have their own candles which all smelled so yummy!! We got an assortment of cakes for my friend's birthday (opera, chocolate decadence, tiramisu, strawberry Napoleon, chocolate caramel) and all were lovely :). The staff also gave me candles for free! Their gelato is great too, and for $7 you get an extremely generous serving on a large waffle cone- I would estimate about 2/3 of a pints worth of ice cream, probably a bit more! Still a bit pricey but totally worth it if you are an ice cream lover like me :). I brought home cloudless chocolate cookies and palmiers for the roommate and my SO, and even though they aren't sweets people, they said it was really good too! Next time, I may indulge and buy one of those heavenly smelling candles!"
0,"Hurry up and Leave!\n\nThis was our third visit to Hana because the food is excellent. God forbid you walk in at 8:40pm, 20 minutes until posted hours of closing time. Might as well post closing at 8:30pm as both service and quality decline closer to closing!!!\n\nFist two visits went extremely well and so why not try it a third, right?!?! NO! It was CLEAR by the hostesses reaction that we were not welcome at 840pm as she rolled her eyes and quickly walked away from us. Not a good first impression but we were confident in the food and decided to give it a go. We had a nice bottle of wine and were expecting a wonderful date night and the typical HANA experience... DENIED!\nWe were in and out in less than 40 minutes, $75 for two of us (without tip), not including our bottle of wine we shared one glass of. We found ourselves shoveling food in our faces as the servers were doing all of their side work surrounding us. Very uncomfortable dining experience and disappointing. \n\nI'm not one to post and especially not with a negative review and I WILL go back (before 8pm), but I do believe the owners and future guest should be aware of this situation. Last time I checked if your posted hours are until 9pm, you serve food until 9pm???? Right? Not everyone out by 9pm! Not to mention with your price point, guest are visiting your establishment to enjoy their dinning experience and not be rushed! \n\nWe ended up going to Sochu House for a couple other dishes as we did not get enough to eat and Lord knows my man needs his dessert. Hopefully, next visit will be earlier and better. Know that you have been warned, and enjoy Hana, but go early!!!!!"
1,"Serious cheese shop with the most knowledgable people who are so proud of their cheeses. I went there every day during my 4 night stay in Madison  - they made up this amazing cheese plate for me with hand picked cheeses, olives, crostini, nuts, berries - this store is so well merchandised with amazing gift items (more for me) and locally sourced gifts. I was actually giddy when I walked in the first time -and they are generous with samples. I am still in awe of this place. I believe this is the best cheese shop I have ever visited - and they made this great vegetarian sandwich for me, even though they offer many varieties of meats too. I feel like I should send them a thank you note for letting me experience such a place...really. Can't miss this place if you go to Madison. We were visiting for the Ironman WI race (husband raced, I ate cheese) and we have a really good cheese shop in Del Ray VA called Cheesetique but this one...wow...really amazing ownership."
1,Major Upgrade to this gym!
0,"Absolutely disgusting! I would not recommend for anyone to go. If you have any expectations at all of eating good tasting food, do not come here. Doesn't matter that it's outdated inside, the food is piping hot because it sits in those metal tins for lord knows how long. I don't even want to know when it was last freshly made. I ate a piece of sushi and there was some foul fish in there that I had to spit it out into a napkin (something I've never done before in a \""restaurant\"") and lost my appetite for the rest of my meal. Well, I guess my $12 went a long way! Never again."
0,"My son and I attended a birthday party here today, the people at wet n wild were late to greet our group. The party was @ 12pm and we all waited at the front of the park as they told us for a party attendant to arrive, it wasn't until 12:30 someone showed up and walked us to put table, our pizza was suppose to arrive at 1pm as did not come until 2pm, the crew was very inattentive. \n     Itself order a chicken Caesar salad, please save your money and do not order or eat this, the piece of chicken did not look like real chicken and I really don't think it was and the salad was old and soggy.\n      I must say the park itself with water slides, ect was a good time and my son and I greatly enjoyed it, but the staff and food could definitely have some improving, especially if your attending a birthday party that parent spent a lot of $$ for her child's special day and you guys did not make it special once so ever it's a real disappointment. And the good was an extreme disappointment considering the healthy option you did have tasted like yesterday's trash!"
1,"Any place that sells red liquorice is a proven winner in my eyes.  True to form, Experience (a somewhat bizarre name for a health foods shop) sells the chewy red stuff by the bucket load and I love it. \n\nDried fruits and other packets of health food are all here but admittedly I'm only drawn in by the liquorice treats. \n\nIn fact I've run out, I'm off to get some!"
1,"The real deal. Best chocolate croissants in Edinburgh, hands down. Especially if you can get them fresh out of the oven. Yummmm. Also, good coffee. My friend had the charcuterie plate once and it looked delish. Seating is a bit tight, but it doesn't even matter because if you can manage to get a table you don't mind."
0,"This place....ugh\n\nFirst... Their check in is 45 minutes before flight.  This isn't stated anywhere in their website etc. I got there 44 minutes before and wasn't allowed to check in.  There were about 5 other families behind me.  I've checked in 30 minutes prior to flight on other airlines. \n\nI paid the \""carry on\"" fees (It's cheaper to just check a bag btw) on line.  Since I \""missed my flight\"" I had to pay the luggage fees a second time, the fees don't apply to airfare rebooked.  SO...if you think you're saving money flying with these clowns,  you're not if the carry on/checked bag fees are taken into consideration. \n\nThe best part of this fiasco was when the agent asked the guy next to me who was bitching about Frontier charging him luggage fees twice, \"" do I look like Frontier Airlines to you? \""  Bonus points for being extra rude lady. \n\nDo yourselves a favor and pay the 50$ higher fee elsewhere."
0,"I gave this place a second chance after my first horrific experience.  I wish I could say it got better.  I bought an Americano again - and it only became palatable after I watered it down heavily when I got back to the office.  Undiluted, the coffee just tasted burnt.  The service was slightly better, but that wasn't a challenge considering how bad it was on my first visit.  For the price, I expect better coffee and better service, not just the cachet of an indie coffee house."
0,"Bleh. Has a weird  smell in the casino and definitely looks old. The \""plain jane\"" interior doesn't quite go with the unique exterior theme of pirates and booty. No one was ever in the cafe-restaurant-lounge-bar that they advertised so much (Kahunaville). Location-wise it is okay, but there's no hotel connected to it (like Aria-Cosmo or Bellagio-Caesars)...unless you count the tram to Mirage but meh.\n\nThe hotel rooms were also pretty meh. We had no inner shower curtain liner thing so our bathroom was very wet. Towels are small and rough. Not enough lighting unless you turned on every lamp and switch in the room, and even then, it was awkward. Mirrors/closet doors were also angled badly and very little outlets for charging phones. I really don't like this place, but maybe the suites will be better."
0,"I am not impressed with their food, Taco Bell is far better."
1,"Good deals, decent produce and friendly employees. They could use a couple more self checkout lanes sometimes but it's usually not too bad. What else could you want?"
0,Small. Looked like ice walking. Got there 15 min after opened. Already packed. No real ice SKATING more like ice walking. Don't bother.
0,use to be a max and erma's and if that bar wasn't low enough it now misses the mark
0,"Sad to say Mac's is no longer in our rotational favorites. We appreciate prompt service, but the food is coming out lightning fast with lots of issues. The meat is dry and lukewarm. Mac&cheese is more eggy than cheesy. Brisket was tough and the Texas toast wasn't grilled ,plus wet from sauce on plates. The wings and salads are still tasty. The once delicious bread pudding is also a victim of low quality ingredients. Service was also lacking where we felt  like we were an inconvenience. Hate to run you down for refills/check.  We hope things return to days past  or will definitely not be back."
0,"I took my friend to the Mercy Gilbert Emergency Room and I was very surprised at how callously she was treated.  She was in severe pain and was placed in a bed about 10 feet from the nurse's station.  \n\nWhile she lay suffering, the nurses were loudly discussing their weekend plans without any regard for her.  \""I'm going out with Josh tonight!\""  \""I've been checking flights for my trip.\""  \n\nWhen I requested a cup of water for my friend, they told me no and instructed me to get back behind the curtain.\n\nThis went on for an hour and these nurses couldn't have cared any less.  \n\nI was further shocked when the hospital's Director of Customer Experience told me that the hospital is known for pain management.  I almost laughed out loud.\n\nIf you have the choice to go to a different ER, do it."
1,"Good food, decent beer, terrible bar service. Girl with short blond hair behind bar was awful. I'm sure this places gets better with time. I'd come back!"
0,"We were here for lunch and there were NOBODY there, except us. I guess everybody shows up at night for shabu shabu. We ordered 2 bibimbap and they were pretty tasty. I think it is their paste or something. Also, they don't give out a lot of side dishes."
0,"Liars! They sold a \""get it now\""group on so my husband bought it specifically for Labor Day on it-it stated it was only valid for September 2nd for lunch. We purchase two beers, six wings, a burrito, and beef tacos. The total came to $80. They would not accept the group on. They said they were trying to block out that group on for two weeks, but it just had been post one week earlier. So we had to pay all that money for two lousy beers and some pretty generic food. Save your money, their are a lot better places on the strip, with much better food, that is reasonably priced."
1,"Make a reservation! This place is deservedly popular. Everything has quite a kick to it, but they will strip certain menu items of the spices (e.g. Salmon) upon request. \n\nTables are close together and I always end up talking to the coolest people about the food they're eating. \n\nUsually a great experience. Last night our waitress was cold and pushy, which detracted from the typically positive dining experience. Otherwise, I highly recommend Mesa Grill."
1,"Ahh Ellefsen, what to make of you? I am surprised to be the first to talk about this local Villeray/Rosemont joint! It used to be a rather sleazy dive, was promptly bought and has become the only competitor to everyone's favorite furniture store for Scandinavian food. Slight modification: Ellefsen is Norwegian(-style) rather than swedish.\n\nThe decor is lovely:pastel tones and wooden surfaces, the menu is written on blackboards (isn't that the new hip thing of the moment or what?). It's a a bit european-clich\u00e9 but i'm totally buying it anyway. Their specialty is the smorrebrod (with dashed o's), a typically Scandinavian open-sandwich on rye bread, or rather a slice of bread, if you're a \""glass-half-empty\"" kind of person. Their slection is astounding: squash, salmon, caviar, quails (?!!!). Ellefsen brings together chic cuisine in a caf\u00e9 setting! I've had some excellent Elk bavette. Last time I went, they even offered horse bavette! Chanterelles also seem a staple of the menu. If you'd like to stay a bit closer to Quebec, try one of their poutines (one with meatballs, the other with cod). Their main dishes are all delicious, although the chef seems to like salt, alot, everywhere, on everything.\n\nTheir breakfast earned the european-parents-seal-of-approval: strong black coffee! The muffins and croissants are obviously fresh of the morning, and to die for (take note of the unusual flavours: orange-grapefruit muffins! YUM!). My own favorite is the Ellefsen fruit plate (it's huge! with sour yoghurt and muesli) with a glass of freshly-squeezed juice. Sadly, no desserts! :(\n\nWhile I love the food, I'm still unsure of my opinion of Ellefsen. While i was snapping pictures for this review, an older lady randomly asked me: \""Is it strictly for students?\"". And you'd think it's hipster central! Berets, leggings and white laptops galore! The free WIFI is extremely attractive I admit. I've also seen families, but only rarely encounter middle-aged people. Hmmmm. Alright, I'll say it: I'm bugged by the service: sometimes I'll come and the waitress will be at my table ready for my order, other times none of them will budge and after an epic wait, I'll go to the counter and then when I automatically go to the counter they seem surprised.. What to do for a smorrebrod!! Another thing I've picked up on is a discreet but steady rise in prices..\nRegardless, I love the food, I love the setting and I am back, relentlessly.."
1,"Ok so we finally got a chance to check Tao a club everyone raves about, and yeah it sorta lives up to its rep. We went 2 saturdays ago and the place was PACKED no Im telling u....PACKED!\nSo we roll up and it looked like an hour long wait but we got in right away, no guest list, no lines or anything due to the fact that the girls we were with just had to do was be flirty w/the bouncers and BAM we were in!!!\nSo we get in and this is how it goes:\nPROS:\n1) Decent DJ\n2) Drinks are good\n3) Go Go dancers are HOT!\n4) Lotta eye candy\n5) Club is nice really done up & big\n\nCons:\n1) if ur ugly or have no pull expect to wait for like an hour\n2) the main dance floor is INSANELY packed, I mean like scary u might get trampled PACKED.\n3) Drinks are pricey, but hey its vegas what do u expect.\n\nSo over all yeah the place is good times but I still prefer the Hollywood scene theres no place like home, yall should check it, hope this helps."
1,"Pretty good food frites were off the grid and the service was ok. Not the best, but not the worst either. ( I guess maybe because there were a lot of customers but then again it wasn t full.)Also, there weren t that many choices of meals you could pick.  Bottom line, I will recommend this restaurant. I was very sasitfied in general."
0,"I have been here twice and my first experience was pretty pleasant although I kind of felt like I was being watched closely by the security guard, like I was going to steal something. It made me feel very uncomfortable and if I was ever going to steal any thing from that store it would have been the nail polish which was located at the register. There really is nothing in here I couldn't live without but I did find a really cute cardigan for my nephew. The employees were pleasant while they were checking me out but the whole time the security guard stood by the register watching but not watching (if that makes sense). Really ackward!\n\nMy second visit (same day but later) was to exchange the cardigan I bought for my nephew for a bigger size. There was the same security guard standing around and only one worker who told me she was a new employee. I let her know I just needed to exchange the cardigan for a bigger size and she told me that she couldn't do exchanges or returns and I would have to wait for the store manager to get back from her lunch. I asked how long and she said about 15 more minutes. So I went back out to my car and sat for 20 minutes just so I could exchange this cardigan! I was upset that I had to wait so long just to do an exchange when I bought the cardigan earlier in the morning. Although the store manager was polite when doing the exchange, she never apoligized for making me wait around for 20 minutes.\n\nHow can you leave an employee on their own when they do not know or have any authority to do exchanges or returns?!\n\nIt will be awhile before I ever go back to this store if ever."
0,"Service started out good,  then went downhill.  Nails were messed up and had to have her go back and fix them. Every two weeks when I came in to get a fill I was charged more and more.  Kind of ridiculous."
0,"We visited the Dillon's located in the Wildlife World Zoo. The zoo was not overly busy this day. We waited 20 minutes to be seated which was one with us, we expected a little wait. When we were seated, our server was very nice and professional, but after she took our order it took about 45 minutes to get our food. As annoying as this was, it was actually a big inconvenience because we had an antsy 5 year old and a 4 month old with us. When we finally got our food it was not bad but not great, and definitely not worth the wait. On a positive note, we only paid about $50 for 3 adult entrees, 1 child's meal, and 3 beers."
0,"Nice friendly....but is that to hid something.\n\nWent in at about 9Pm on Saturday June 8th to get a smog on my vehicle.  I was told that it did not pass smog, but the person behind the counter could not tell me what the code meant why I did not pass smog, but if I wanted to bring it back for $94.00 I could bring it back tomorrow and they could put it on their machine and tell me what was wrong with it. I went home and contacted a friend who said the code on my failed smog was for a break light switch.....what the hell does my brakes have to do with my emissions. So Sunday we went to the car was at Charleston and Torrey Pines that also does smog....GUESS WHAT.....my vehicle passed smog without a hitch,  Do not go to Sun Valley Automotive,,,,,if you do and you don't pass get a second opinion. I wonder what they would have said if I let them put it on their machine.   Nice waiting room, but I guess they have to make money somewhere to pay for it"
0,"The worst customer service ever by the front desk manager and reservation agent.   I went to check in, the manager told me that I was suppose to be there a few days before.  I told him that he was wrong and he went into the back room and a reservation agent came out.   The agent tells me that he remembered speaking with me about this reservation.   I almost died right on the spot, I ask him, you really remembered speaking to me out of all the people you speak too?  He said yes, I ask him what day did I call in, he said a few days ago.  I ask again, what day, he told me Sunday.   I started laughing because I was on a plane all day coming back to California from Hawaii.  There was no way I could have spoken to him as the plane didn't have any phones on board.   They ended up charging the 2 extra days on my bill, but then I spoke to the VIP manager and he got it removed.   I will never ever stay at this hotel again!  NEVER!!!!!!!!!"
0,"I don't know what's happening to this place. But I don't like it. The aquarium is boring. And it STINKS to high heaven. Some spots smelled so bad I could barely stand it. Up by the lights in the ceiling, cobwebs. The stingray tank smelled awful. The other area where you could pet sea life stunk. I've been to other aquariums with these features and never experienced this.\n\nSome of the habitats for the animals are SAD. The giraffes....there are no trees for them. They have barely any space. This place is crazy expensive to get into. What are they spending our money on?!\n\nI will make the long drive and go to the Phoenix Zoo next time. This place is sad and I won't be shocked if it's found out this place is being misrun. No more of my money you shall get, subpar and sad zoo!"
1,"This is just such a unique sandwich shop! In my opinion, exactly what Pittsburgh needs.  A Must try.\n\nStaff: warm, welcoming, and very helpful\n\nFood: I've tried two of the veggie-friendly sandwiches, and both were AWESOME. The hummus sandwich was salty and delicious. The collard greens (seasonal) was warm, and comforting. Friends have tried the duck, thin man, and chicken and really loved them.\n\nBefore you go- make sure you have an open mind. I saw a family come in, wrinkle their noses and leave. REALLY? They totally missed out! If you don't know what something is on them menu, just ask! They will probably let you have a taste. And the seltzer drinks are a must!!"
1,"A   v  e  r  y   tasty burger!\n\nYes, at the chuck box I expected very little but got a different friday lunch experience, thats for sure. Yes, it is odd that one shouts ones order over a line of waiting patrons to the loud chef in the kitchen - but that just add to the experience.\n \nWeird - a bit\nUnorthodox - absolutely\nWrong - not at all\n\nThen after joining the crowd of hungry, waiting customers I start to checking out the place. Red hot fire that the burgers all are braised over makes it kinda genuine in a way. A bar in the centre with all condiments and fixings, is up for grabs once the correct burger has been fetched and paid for. \n\nAs I stated initially, I got myself a very tasty burger and a small serving of very tasty onion rings. It was Friday, so I'm allowed to.\n\nI even liked the crates that substitutes for chairs and makes sure that as long as you are here, you are here to eat. There was a few things that could been improved, (and the ill manner isn't one of them) but overall I really enjoyed the chuck box and I will come back. Oh yes, I will come back."
1,"The wife and I were on vacation in Vegas for 5 days, we were getting tired of the same old casino food, and wanted a change. A friend recommended La Comida before we even left San Diego.\nI asked the wife if she would like to try the restaurant, and off we went. That was the best damn food choice we made, we went back two more times before we came back to SD. Jonny was our bartender, very friendly and attentive to our drink needs. Every drink we ordered was made and mixed to perfection, I was impressed, and that is not easily done since I am in the food and drink industry.\n Now about the food, first time we ordered we played it safe, (we are a long way from home if you know what I mean) we had the carne asada salad and the carnitas tacos, lets just say \""WOW!!!\"" the flavors were amazing and worked very well together' the meats were tender and moist and every bite was better then the last. about that time the manager (Rafael) came over to check on us, I said everything was awesome. he asked what we had and then suggested next time be more adventurous, and asked if next time we come in if he could order for us. I told him tomorrow he would have that opportunity. the next evening we were back, greeted by a very friendly hostess and Rafael, who asked if we like pork and chicken. We were seated in about 30 sec. drink orders taken, chips and salsa on the table. don't get me started on the chips... (3 bowls).  soon after that our food arrived, WTF??? I never got a menu, Rafael said he ordered for us. we had the Puerco Ahumado and Chicken Al Horno. This was truly Mexican food at it's best. I could not believe the flavors that these dishes had. Everything was above excellent, all the staff awesome, the chefs are amazing and talented. Thank you La Comida for being part of our awesome vacation. We will be back again and again."
0,"Seriously.  Go across the street to the Palazzo or Venetian.\n\nI stayed at the Palazzo for one night and wanted to try the Wynn because of the reputation, but it pales in comparison.\n\nThe rooms are much smaller, the decor is outdated, the lobby not as open and welcoming.\n\nI got my room refunded and skipped back over to the Palazzo."
1,"I was recently in Vegas for a wedding and the groom's parents generously treated the wedding party and family members to a reception here.  The weather was PERFECT and we were up on the rooftop deck for the night.   The patio was nice with an ample amount of chairs and tables for sitting and mingling.  On the opposite side of the bar is a stage where bands can play.\n\nI stuck with beer for the whole weekend and here, they served Negro Modelo in the bottle (along with other beers, of course).   I only had a wedge of the Mexican pizza appetizer and it was damn good.  I highly recommend ordering that.\n\nThe servers were great.  Very friendly and attentive (and attractive, but duh...it is Vegas).  Based on the ambiance and service, this place is awesome and I would come back here again."
1,Went there and tried the food and it was good. Kinda pricey but the food is good.
0,The chips and salsa are the best thing here that I have tried. Their tortillas are like the ones you buy at the store and their beans taste like Rosarita canned beans. This is probably a good place to go for drinks and appetizers but not so much for a meal. The staff was very friendly. Ill probably go back just for the convenience.
1,Love this place! Super inexpensive. Even the food is inexpensive. Great shopping experience. Only down fall is you have to put the furniture together. Which requires an MIT degree hahahah!!!

0,"This was the first Vegas club/lounge I went to... and boy, was it a forgettable one. \n\nFirstly, the venue is packed with guys... with an occasional woman here and there, however, since there is no dance area really, the herds of men shower the bar area while the few women stand on the outside of the watering hole that are the main bars. The Guy-girl ratio was a good 15-1... not my type of venue. Coyote Ugly also draws in an older crowd (which is okay, but not for someone who just turned 21). The music was not very good and our entertainment consisted of bar tenders dancing on bar tops and encouraging middle-aged women to do something \""crazy\"" like dancing on a bar top. Conversely, the herds of men watch and watch and watch for something crazy to happen... and nothing ever does. \n\nI don't see how this place could be satisfying for men or women. The only niche I see for Coyote Ugly is drawing in a middle-aged crowd seeking to get away from the pretentious Vegas scene and be in a venue where you will not really be bothered. Unless that is your scene, expect to be bored out of your mind."

0,"After doing researcher on their wed site, I was excited about gathering a group of moms to play at their open gym. I called to get more information about a specific  event and was told they no longer have that event. However, they did still hold an open gym during that time.  So a girlfriend and I arrived at noon and were told very rudely that we were 30 mins early. There was no classes going on at the time and the little kids area was empty. I told them I had just called and was told 12 pm, and even mentioned the event that they no longer have. The front desk staff did not care and told us that we would have to wait. I asked about the event that was on their wed site and was told that I was wrong, even though I had checked before going that day and it was still on there. The second time going, was not any better and they were still extremely rude and very confrontational. This was my third time going and once again the staff was rude, disorganized and did not care about my business. The open gym is a bit pricey and is only a hour and a half, in which they always open the doors late and then want you to stretch for the first 10 minutes. I have a 22 month old son, so he could care less about sitting and stretching. Then they kick you out  10 minutes before its over, and have you walk across the parking lot for a free snack(small bag of goldfish). The option to stay and play for the last 10 minutes is not available and every staff member(all teenagers) told me at one time or another that open gym was now over.  I would not mind the price or the length of time, if the stuff was friendly!! :("
0,"Came here to get pizza to go & while I waited had some wine and the cheese platter. The platter was massive and well presented however the cheeses were boring. The service was disappointing, the girls were very nice but didn't really know how to manage their time so I spent a lot of time waiting for my server.. Anyway I got my pizza and walked home, I opened the box to discover a good looking pie, which made me smile but when I went to grab a slice, I noticed my server didn't bother to slice it properly or even at all (even though I saw her slicing other pizzas!)\n\nLuckily, I do have a pizza cutter so it worked out. The pizza was good, crispy crust, light toppings. \n\nAll in all it was not what I expected. Give it a try, but I won't be going back.\n\nHappy New Year my darlings !"

0,"This was my third Cirque show and I had high expectations for this show. As soon as you walk into the theater you get excited and just know this show is going to be great. After about 10 mins I was bored out of mind. The story was a little hard to follow and if youre expecting lots of flying, juggling, the normal Cirque stuff, this is not the show to see. If you get free tickets like I did, go ahead and see it, but I wouldve asked for a refund if I had paid."
1,"I dunno... saw one of the best shows of my life there.  It is big.  It has trees inside.  It has Chihuly... minus two.  \n\nI don't know, though.  I just don't like it.  The floor is a wreck of different ideas running into each other like trains.  I am sure it serves its purpose.\n\nAs a guest, you can hardly move through the lobby... the place is treated like Disneyland, and the lobby and casino and floors are filled by gawkers without any semblance of predictability as to their exhausted stupour filled stagger.\n\nBut \""O\""!\n\n\""O\""!\n\nWow."
0,"I am out of appeals. There was the initial investigation, appeal #1, and then appeal #2. I have two letters from the post office stating you were not available for comment when they contacted you. They are also adamant that they delivered the package to closet candy boutique. ALL I HAVE TO SAY IS MAKE SURE YOU ADD THE SIGNATURE REQUIRED FOR YOUR RETURNS They can say they never received my return all day long, but if I would have added the signature part I would have been fine. The signature part is not required for items under $200, but I highly recommend it when dealing with CCB.\n\nThanks for mentioning my recent order.... I was very disappointed with the blk/wh chevron maxi I purchased. I put it on and it was tight at the bottom like a mermaid costume. I took one normal step and it ripped up the side. I knew better then to return it for poor quality, so I took it to the cleaners and paid them to add slits to it. Don't worry I will NEVER be ordering from you guys again because it is crazy to keep patronizing a business that treats their paying customers so badly. I will stick to the merchants that I know are honest.\n\nI am out $173.00 and to add insult to injury you keep acting like I am lying!!! I wish there was a place on here to upload the letters from the post office for all to see!!"
0,Maybe it's because I'm an old fogey but the frenetic music they pumped into the dining room just ruined the whole dinner.

1,"The stout is my favorite here... great place for happy hour. Cheap beer and the mini pizzas are half off. The pizookie alone should get 5 stars. My only complaint? Too many choices. You would think that is a good thing... well its not. I get so overwhelmed with choices I end up getting the same thing every time. Food prices are a bit high. They could certainly tone down the portions a bit, nobody should ever finish an entire serving here... its always way too much food."
0,Cadre sympa et bonne musique.  La cuisine a \u00e9t\u00e9 juste correcte \u00e0 mon go\u00fbt. Je n'ai pas aim\u00e9 la sauce avec mon tataki et la personne qui nous a servi manquait cruellement de professionnalisme et de tact. Dommage je serai bien revenu si je n'avais pas \u00e9t\u00e9 decue
0,The AYCE is great and the price is better but after multiple let downs I don't think I will ever return. The service here is atrocious! Be sure to bring your patience to dinner if you choose to visit this establishment. If you can't stand going through the drive thru more than once to get your order right then I would strongly advise you to steer clear of this place. Ultimately you'll end up leaving without half the items you ordered.
0,Ok...the chair for my pedicure didn't slide back enough ...I have long legs and my knees were in my chest. A typical pedi is about 45 minutes...not here...she was almost done 20 minutes in. Just a disappointment when I look forward to the 45 minutes.\nThe place was clean and plesant...just wanted more!  Great if you don't have a lot of time...but not if you want to relax.
1,"Wow.  The shakes and zucchini fries were absolutely amazing!\n\nUnfortunately my date and I were a bit underwhelmed by the burgers.  I got the Breakfast Burger and she got the Turkey Burger.  Good, but not excellent.\n\nWe look forward to returning, even for just the shakes and zucchini fries!\n\nEnjoy!"
1,"Tried:\n\nThe Full Montagu (10/10) - meat was super moist and veggies were very fresh. This was my favorite sandwich here.\n\nThe Original (8/10) - really good, but coulda used more horseradish. I highly recommend this if ur a meat kinda person, love philly cheesesteaks, and enjoy horseradish.\n\nTuna Melt (7/10) - this was really good, but i wish they woulda put some veggies in it.  it's literally tuna, cream sauce, cheese, and bread.  it's delicious, but i'm probably NOT gonna order it again if the Full Montagu is still around."
1,"Haben die Ostertage genutzt, um uns das Schoko anzusehen und uns hier das 6-g\u00e4ngige Schokoladenmen\u00fc \""Deluxe\"" zu g\u00f6nnen.\n\n\n Sehr positiver Einstieg: die Reservierung klappte recht kurzfrist und man fand direkt vor dem Restaurant problemlos einen Parkplatz.\n\n\n Die R\u00e4umlichkeiten pr\u00e4sentierten sich stilvoll eingerichtet, freundlich und luftig.

0,"Cheaper than cox and for obvious reasons!!!! Century link is horrible, first off I waited almost 2 weeks for them to come out and hook up my service. The technician that came out was actually super nice, knew what he was doing, great customer service. I signed up for  cable, phone, and internet with them. besides the face that my bill changed each month,  and I noticed I was getting charged for using *69 (which I had added the *69 feature) and when I called to inquire about that and why my bill was dramatically different. The rep I spoke with told me that I did in fact have the feature however I never called to activate it so I had been charged each time I had used it, and then she gave me several reasons to why my billing was always another amount each month. I then requested for them to cancel my service and pick up their equipment  and I called cox and had them connect my services again yet I continued to get bills from century link, each time I called ( about 4 times total) to have them cancel my service they said ok and someone would pick up the equipment, 5 months later I am now getting calls and letters from collections and I still have the equipment sitting in my apartment waiting to be picked up. I even told them I work in the office where I live so they can call me or stop by the office to pick it up if I am not home. This company is a joke cox may not be the best company but century link is the WORST!!!!"
1,"Wassup Annie and Regina!\n\nSo about  Mundo... It was good, but not crazy great. I would need to come back to give it a second try. \n\nWell for this try, we had the Queso Flameado which is like cheese fondue served corn tortilla. The cheese combo was really good, along with the other ingredients they put in it. Came with 3 tortillas.  \nThen for entrees we had Carnitas and Seabass. The carnitas was flavorful and sweet, reminded me of coca-cola braised pork. The portion was rather big which was great but again was served with 3 tortillas (note to the restaurant, please give at least 4 tortillas with the apps and entrees) The Seabass was wrapped in parchment and seasoned with spices. Cooked well but not my favorite because I'm not used to the spices. I'm more of a truest with fish - they need to be simply prepared so I can taste the fish.  \n\nFor dessert we had flan and it was really good but I wasn't a fan of the strawberries and fruit syrup with the caramel sauce. \n\nAbout the service, the server was nice but seemed a bit casual compared to the fine dining ambiance. I would have preferred a more professional and informed server. Maybe that's the style of the restaurant but it didn't fit. \n\nAgain, I need to come back and plan to because they have quite a bit of selection of beef entrees that looked good."
1,Sabrina/Mr. Antenna came out and her and her husband Alexander did a fantastic job. I was reluctant to get rid of Cox but the OTA channels were actually more than I was getting with Cox. Of course I lost some channels but it turns out I never watched most of them anyway. The antenna works great with my two Tivos and the quality of the OTA channels is BETTER - no pixelation like with cable.  Wish I had cut the cord sooner.
1,"I have seen all of the Vegas Cirque Du Soleil shows and this is my favorite one.  I love that there are speakers in the headrests - that extra base and surround sound environment really makes you feel more aware of what is going on in the show.  I love when the speakers pick up the shooting arrows.  It sounds so awesome - like they are zooming by your ears.  The music is also really cool - lots of drums and even a heavy metal electric guitar song.\n\nThe stage feels like a futuristic Matrix or Mad Max environment.  This is a saga about a royal brother and sister that get separated when marauding tribesmen kill their parents during a summer festival.  There is a distinct Asian theme to this cirque.  The tribes people are tattooed like Hawaiians or the Yakuza, there is a Kabuki looking evil lord, and lots of Chinese style acrobatics.  The boy is guarded by the main family warrior who is this yoked shirtless hottie cakes with dreadlocks and a spear.  The girl is guarded by their overweight big breasted nanny and some clowns.  \n\nThe stage is a 360 degree revolving platform that moves horizontally and vertically.  The floor at several points is the wall.  There is this one scene where they are at the beach and then the beach turns into the wall and a zillion pounds of sand slides off of it along with one of the clowns who drops about 30 feet down.  There is another scene where the stage is supposed to be a mountain and the girl and her entourage is trying to climb to the top to escape the evil peeps.  As they are climbing up the wall there are evil people shooting arrows at them from the audience which in turn makes pegs pop out of the wall to simulate arrows sticking out of the wall.  The climbers swing in really pretty circles around the pegs.  The girl gets to the top and is sheltered by these Mongolian looking people.  It is now winter.  \n\nMeanwhile the boy and his stud warrior guardian hang out and make really cool shadow puppets.  They subsequently get caught by the tribesmen and get put in wheel shaped cages.  In the process there are a couple of other scenes including this one where guys are running and jumping rope on the outside of these hamster wheels that are revolving like a Ferris wheel about 30 feet in the air.  That may be the best acrobatics scene in the whole show.  While in captivity, the boy falls in love with the tribes' princess, who looks a little butch.  She releases him so that he can find his sister and then she does a cool baton twirling dance.  \n\nThe sister also falls in love with some dude in that sheer Britney Spears outfit with the little diamonds all over it and a red thong and they flirt with each other while flying around the stage from one of those hanging sheets.  Visually it is really pretty, but the dude looks like he might be a little light in the loafers with his long flowing hair and rhinestone outfit.\n\nI don't know how the brother and the sister reunite, but they do and they regroup and go to war against the evil Kabuki lord with the help of the tribes' princess' troops.  I forgot to mention that somewhere along the way the boy rescues the princess' dad from being captured by Kabuki face.  The bad people that tried to capture the boy and the girl are now on their side.  They go to war; the stage is again a wall and of course they win, get their kingdom back and the boy and the girl get married and all of the costumes are really pretty. \n\nSome other cool scenes include a boat on the stormy waters, an insect inspired rain forest act with swinging acrobats, and a flying contraption made to look like a bird that is operated by 5 people.  This is a must see theater production.  It was so worth the $340 we spent on tics"
1,"Great place to go for a quality car wash.\n\nIt's located on the east side and even though the appearance at first could change your mind. Don't be afraid to give this place a chance!\n\nYou drive up to the side and there's workers ready to help you for whatever you want to get done to your car. They have a big menu posted and you get to choose what service you want. I personally choose the $17.99 value wash which includes vacuuming, polishing, waxing and washing. You head inside afterwards to pay in which the cashier gives you a card with a stamp that will verify the workers outside if you paid or not. The wait time depends on what time you go and if no one is ahead of you. I went recently and had no one there.. Then suddenly 3 minutes afterwards 6 people walked in! I probably waited a total of 10-15 minutes for my car.\n\nSome people may think $17.99 is expensive for a car wash. That itself is true, but this does not only include a car wash but vacuuming, polishing and waxing. I think that itself is well worth the $17.99 - plus my friend who introduced me to this place informed me that they do a guarantee re-wash if within a certain amount of days we get rainy weather. You might want to check up on that though."
0,"Don't worry be happy. \nThe poor waitress seemed so depressed or moody better yet said. \nI didn't want to ask for anything, I didn't want her to go all psycho ninja on my ass.\nI didn't receive 1 smile from this lady. The whole time I was there I just wanted to leave.\n\nOn with the food. I had a Caldo de albondiga, honestly though it tasted like it was from a can. It wasn't all that great. Even I could make this soup better. \nThe cheesy salsa was bomb.com  It was a spicy salsa with cheese melted inside.\n\n$2.00 for a canned soda because they don't have fountain drinks. \n\nSpeedy service is a fact at this joint\n\nSolicitors are welcome\n\nBeer is served cold\n\nOverall this place is clean\n\nFor now this places doesn't meet the standards for Mexican, perhaps Salvadorian.\nI wouldn't recommend this places at all."
0,"Overpriced, confusing hodgepodge. Typical Vegas restaurant with no identity. Even waiters were laughing at the selection in the Dim Sum cart. We asked if anything had chicken. The waiter stuck out his tongue and laughed, \""Chicken feet!\"".  The food was ordinary. But the surrounding architecture is something to figure out as you try to figure out why you ate here. Very few real Thai dishes on menu."
1,"Mirage Nail & Spa was suggested to me over 2 years ago and I have been going back ever since.  \nMy \""go to\"" girl is Heidi.  She does the absolute best job on my gel manicures, pedicures and eyebrow waxing.  Pedicures last for months and my gel manicure always stays on for at least 3 weeks.  I constantly receive compliments on my nails.  She always remembers my name whenever I come in, which really makes you feel welcome.  She goes the extra mile and really takes her time.  I don't mind spending an afternoon at the nail spa, because I make time for it.  I think if you are in a hurry, you should let your manicurist know so they can try and work in your time constraints.\nI also enjoy getting my eyelashes done there.  They do eyelash extensions for a very reasonable price.  They last 2-3 weeks and look very nice.  I usually get them done for special occasions.  If they start to come out before the 2 week period, they will fix them for you.  I would ask for Van or Mimi to do your eyelashes.  They both do a great job.\nAlso, a bit of advice for people that don't like to wait to get service... make an appointment.  Yes, this place is busy.  Evenings and weekends are the craziest.  They are very popular, evidence of how great they are.  I've gone on a Friday evening and it's packed.  Even with an appointment, I had to wait 20 minutes.  I didn't mind though, because I would never go anywhere else.  They had to turn away people that just walked in.  Walk-Ins are welcome, but it's not guaranteed you'll get service.  Monday through Wednesday is usually a pretty good time to go.\nAnyway, if you are looking for a \""Grade A\"" place to get your nail and waxing services done, I really think you should give Mirage Nail & Spa a try.  :O)"
1,"We had been looking for a casual place to grab a quick bite because we had been traveling all day and were cranky. We didn't want a chain that we could get back home and were intrigued when we saw the other reviews on yelp about this place. Overall, it was a great meal. You can build your own pizzas and salads- and not subway quality ingredients either. The sweet balsamic dressing is incredible so definitely give that a try if you get a salad. The crust is very thin so if that's not your thing then this place isn't for you. But the pizzas cook quickly in their pizza oven and are awesome!! The staff was very friendly as well! Very casual and delicious."
0,"Desperate for food was more like it...after walking from Monte Carlo all the way to the Venetian till 2am our party was starving.\nI was reluctant to have chinese food here in Vegas since Toronto by far till this day has the best Chinese food.\n\nService was a 2/5, our server seemed a bit snobbish, and was not at all a people-person.  Perhaps its the the \""AM\"" time which was getting to him.  However the female manager who came by to serve our food was very pleasant, and indeed a cutie with a twinkle in her winkle lol.....\n\nI had the night market fried rice 4/5: sliced beef tossed in thai chilli, basil, bean sprouts, and diced tomatos was yumm!! perfect balance of flavors, however the beef slices could have been smaller.  Each slice was half a mouthful lol...\n\nBBQ Pork & Duck Noodle Soup 2/5: Barely any duck, and a few slices of bbq pork, the presentation was great, but honestly not worth it.\n\nFu Chow Fried Rice 3/5: presentation, taste, and portion was bang on! lots of shrimp, chicken, mushroom, calamari, and scallion gravy...worth it!!\n\nOverall the quality of the dishes were below my expectations.  This restaurant almost seemed like a waste of space that lacked the taste. Sorry Venetian"
1,"Went last summer to see the show. Show was sold out and fans were well behaved. She did interact with some fans who sat up front. Show is incredible. This show isn't offered from those timeshares or even half off tickets. If you're a fan, go see her. It's expensive but well worth it."
0,"go to another one, lines are super long, we were like 10 deep during lunchtime & only 2 cashiers. one of which was dealing with an exchange. then the other lady, figured she needed to go help someone, and left her register. I wanted to kick her.\n\nasked another employee where something was, without acknowledging me, smiling, nor looking up he told me where it was like I was bothering him....\n\nthere's a reason this one is the lowest rated out of the others in town. I was praying for a customer survey on  my receipt."
1,"I ate here for the first time today, I had some carne asada and carnitas tacos.  They were probably the best tacos I've ever had.  The rice and beans on the side were also really good.  Cheap prices and great friendly service.  I have a feeling I will become a regular at this place!  Can't wait to try the rest of the menu."
1,"I've used this hotel for years through work and have always had a positive experience.  Free WiFi, great front desk staff, big rooms and easy access to the great city of Madison. \n  I tend to be very hard on hotels but this one always leaves me satisfied."
0,Ambience was great but food was very mediocre. The noodles tasted good. I didn't like the Manchurian. Food was very spicy.
1,"The whole place reeks of elegance.\n\nSomething about this place is different. Not sure what it is but it's almost palpable. The whole place has a very distinct odor. \n\nI like it here. It's comfortable. The rooms are nice and big. So far I have not had to pay for a room, special thanks to the casino host for the rooms.\n\nThe show, Blue Man Group was fun. The restaurants are great. I especially love the Tao, Delmonico Steakhouse and there's nothing like having noodles at 3am at Noodle Asia.\n\nShopping here is not only wonderful but also fun.\n\nI have good luck here."
1,"We were in town for my college roommate's 25th birthday! \n\nThis was the best decision we made!!\n\n3 clubs, no cover, no line, party bus, free shots, cheap drinks (at the meet up spot), and fun meeting random people in Vegas!\n\nWe met up at a hotel bar/club (forgot which one) and you got a free drink then $5 drinks after. We saw a woman passing out $1 drink wristbands too so you could get pretty buzzed for cheap!\n\nOur schedule was 1Oak, Hyde, Pure. You stay at each club for about 1.5-2 hrs. As the night progresses, the party bus gets poppin and drinks are still flowing and everyone (for the most part) is pretty cool. There were like 50-75 people with our group so we had like 2-3 huge party busses. There is plenty of room for everyone. Honestly, you could go alone and still have a good time!\n\nWe each paid $45. We missed the Groupon deal but called and got a code from customer service. There's always a deal somewhere - One on here!! I think the original price is $85. \n\nThe hosts and hostesses are great! So much fun! I even got a free drink from 1Oak because of one of the hostesses! Loved them!\nI would recommend this to any and everyone going to Vegas! Glad we found it!!"
0,"I really try and support local hardware retailers (granted this isn't local, but it's not \""big box\"") as I worked at a small chain back in school.  However I cringe when I have to go here, the staff hasn't been too friendly to me.\n\nI ordered something online and for the longest time the tracking simply said the item had been shipped, meanwhile I ordered something via Home Depot after ACE and it came before!  It seemed like the error was the store received the product but never scanned it in, thus I thought it was still in transit.\n\nThe past 2 times I've gone there, 15-20 min before closing, the employees are huddled at the front of the store and immediately ask me what I'm looking (in not the nicest tone) for because they close soon.  It just seems very pushy, as I'll go to Home Depot or Lowes 5 min before closing and I don't get asked.\n\nI most likely would have bought more items if I didn't feel like they wanted to shut up shop early for the night.  I'll continue to go here for items on my way home, but not for my main hardware needs."
1,Best all you can eat sushi I have had in Las Vegas. Great assortment of specialty rolls. The chefs made great suggestions based on what I like. I'll go back again.
1,"I am certain that the Wynn has jostle potential to disappoint and frankly, the staff has an attitude that suggests that I am luck to be served by them.  That said, I have love love loved my two stays here.\n\nRooms are beautiful.\n\nService is attentive, albeit smug.\n\nThe property is well thought out.\n\nI could go without the Steve Wynn infomercial on the large LCD plasma, but. He does have a great vision.\n\nI'd happy stay again..."
0,"Actually, my rating is zero stars but yelp has a one-star minimum.\n\n-- Horrible service.  Think server making crude comments and jokes.\n\n-- Mediocre food.  Go to Ruth's Chris or Morton's.  Really.\n\n-- Roadhouse atmosphere.  Obnoxious guests disturbing everyone around them.  Management taking no effective action.  Guests trying to start a fight.  Management taking no effective action.\n\nI could go into the whole story about the worst dining experience I've ever had but the three points above sum things up in a nutshell."
1,I've been here twice with my girlfriend and her family. I absolutely love the ambience and the d\u00e9cor. Very Downtown posh! The Mac & Cheese is to die for...I crave it on a daily basis and have yet to find anything close to it. The Switch House salad is absolutely delicious...very well balanced between sweet and savory. Spicy Bleu Burger is amazing. The Beef is cooked perfectly and the tangy wing sauce with the bleu cheese crumbles is the perfect combination. \n\nThey also have THE best cosmos. I suggest the Blueberry Cosmo. I seriously walk out of this place drunk everytime!
1,"Excellent!!! Came here for dinner on New Year's Eve, and had the beef cheek. Food was excellent, and service quite attentive, for such a busy night."
1,"After reading all of the reviews on Yelp on how amazingly delicious this place was, I decided to try it. \n\n First of all, it was good...but not to the point that every one else is making it seem here. I think with all of the hype, I was expecting little pieces of heaven in every bite!\n\n I ordered the bean and cheese chimi enchilada style. I can say that the enchilada sauce was really yummy! I wish i could have finished it all but it was HUGE!! it is a good lunch spot but definitely order ahead because the wait is pretty long. If it is convenient I would probably come again but wouldn't go out of my way to eat here."
0,"I'm assuming this is the location inside the Quad (formerly Imperial Palace)\n\nWe went for breakfast on a friday morning so it was pretty crowded but we got seated within 15minutes. \nThe waiter was very informative, almost to the point of being insulting so that rubbed me the wrong way. \n\nhe asked if we had been there before and then explained about the large portion sizes and stuff and then left us to figure out what we wanted.\nand left us.... and left us... and left us\nand finally came back to take our order\n\ni wanted eggs, bacon and pancakes (i'm boring) \nand he asked what i wanted in my pancake (berries, walnuts, etc)\ni said \""nothing, just a plain buttermilk pancake\""\nhe said (with a disgusted look on his face) \""uh, this isnt IHOP, these arent ordinary pancakes.\""\ni assured him that i just wanted a plain pancake and he shoo'd me off and walked away.\n\nthe portions were big but they werent anything to write home about\n\nthe guy killed it for us though. wont be going back."
0,This place is horrible. I waited more than 30 minutes to the supervisor say me they can't help....
0,"I am saddened that I have to write this review. I usually love this restaurant, but tonight it was disastrous. Our actual waiter came by our table all of 2 times and refilled our drinks maybe twice. The rest of our service relied on what appeared to be a manager and a completely different waiter. We waited about 20 minutes after our drink order before the waiter came to get our actual order. The appetizer my fianc\u00e9e ordered took 15 minutes to get to the table and 5 minutes later out came the food delivered by a different person. What is the point of an appetizer if your main course comes directly after it. We never got a new basket of biscuits.  I won't say that I will never return because this one time, but an apology would have been nice after waiting 45 minutes for our actual meal. Step up the game Red Lobster."
0,"It's a buffet, so preparing for masses can only leave so much care.  The truth is if you are coming here for anything other than quantity you will probably be disappointed.  They have most of the main stations, American, seafood, Mexican, Italian, seafood and desserts.  The service is great, but the best feature is the view.  You can see all of the river and even sit out side on a nice day."
0,"Bleh a knock off version of Fat Tuesdays. I love Fat Tuesdays, but we were here so I needed a drink. $21 for a foot long?! it was really icy too.... Eh thankfully I had a Fat Tuesday the day after because this place was not crackin."
0,"I know this place gets good reviews from some cigar smokers, but this pipe smoker was thoroughly unimpressed with their tiny collection of opened plastic bags filled with dried out tobacco of indeterminate age.  The employees on duty said they knew nothing about pipe smoking and had little idea of what kind of tobacco was even in those big bags. The room in which the tobacco was kept was in total disarray, as if undergoing a major reconstruction. It was a real disappointment.   I hope they've improved things."
1,"I rented a couple Penske trucks through KCM. Chris was very very helpful and you can tell, Chris is most interested in customer satisfaction. If I would have the need to rent a truck again, I certainly will use KCM's Penske truck rental services and Chris.\nKCM has a parking lot full of Penske trucks. You will not find a better truck rental facility."
0,"Food was not good!  I wish I had read some of the reviews before taking my friends there.  We went in for breakfast with 2 other couples based on Guy Fieri's review.  Each of us ordered something different and were very disappointed. The eggs were extra small and over cooked, hash browns were mushy, omelets were burnt on the edges, ham steak was tough and the red eye gravy was about one teaspoonful on the plate. The corned beef hash wasn't any better than Libby's out of the can.  We don't plan to eat here again.  I guess when you know Guy Fieri is coming in you make the food look better and probably taste better.\nToo bad!"
0,"Dude totally took his time getting to my car and when he did, he finished eating his food and browsing on his phone for 20 min. I said hello as he finally exited his truck, but he wasn't friendly back. He crawled up into my car smelling of food and sweat taking an hour to make 1 key and charged me around $170. Terrible service. I gave 2 stars because the job was completed and the lady on the phone who started the service was great!"
0,"Wow, could Enterprise make its business model any more excruciating for the customer? The whole experience of renting a car from this Enterprise was something akin to interacting for an extended period of time with children dressed up in suits, playing business. Okay, maybe not children, but imagine that annoying kid on your high school debate team who talked incessantly about his plans to attend Georgetown law school even though he was only 16. That was my Enterprise representative. He actually reached across the counter to shake my hand, asked me probing questions about the nature of my trip and made sexist remarks about the fact that I was traveling for work. \n\nAnyway, Enterprise appears to mistakenly believe that its customers will welcome scripted faux-friendly chitchat with its silly employees, an excessive amount of paperwork and being forced to combat pressure to buy various insurance policies and upgrade, even when it's obviously unnecessary. UGH. \n\nAll that said, the little Nissan or whatever they gave me was fine for a few little trips around town and I had no hassles returning the car."
0,"This is my second Texas de Brazil location. The Aruba location was absolutely delicious, so I had to visit this location with the boyfriend when we were in Las Vegas since they don't have any locations near us. I was so estatic to introduce him to eat here but unfortunately our dining experience wasn't that great. Most of their meats were heavily salted that our meal mostly consisted of drinking tons of water. Overall, tonight's dinner was the worst dinner we ever had, especially for their pricing and that we couldn't eat our money's worth. Definitely won't be coming back to this location. 1 star for staff friendliness."
1,Best Pizza I've had so far in my 29 years of existence! lol.. it has moved over to MGM grand for those that don't know
1,"I may be lactose intolerant but that has not stopped me from binging on gelato.\n\nGelato 64 is located in the Lee Lee's Plaza on the NE corner of Dobson and Warner. I'll tell you now...it's no Arlecchino, but the quality of the gelato is better than the one just down the road from this place. \n\nThe shop is brand-spanking new, almost clinical-looking, with it's white walls, streamlined lighting, and minimal furnishings (mostly Ikea-looking).The interior is simply non-descript, almost too bland and boring-looking. But perhaps there was a reasoning behind the seemingly sterilized, minimalist environment...ah, yes, of course. The element that seems to give the room character and subtle vibrancy is the gelato.\n\nThe flavor selection is pretty impressive...almost Baskin Robbins-esque, with its 31 flavors (or maybe more!). The consistency of the gelato is excellent, very creamy and it doesn't leave you with a gritty feeling in your mouth. As far as flavors go, I think the fruitier ones win over the chocolate, or cream-based flavors. For example, their rum raisin just lacked the \""punch\"" of rum, and their cherry vanilla really was just vanilla with chunks of frozen cherry. If you were only served one chunk of cherry, then expect to be eating vanilla gelato the rest of the time.\n\nIn contrast, their mango and raspberry, for example, had just the right tartness that made you pucker with delight. The fruity flavors were true to taste and were magnificent when combined. \n\nI say, go for the fruit flavors!\n\nThe staff members were very friendly and courteous, and were very generous in giving you sample tastings. You gotta appreciate that!"
1,Surprisingly great food for what has a reputation as a bar.  Someone in the kitchen knows what they are doing.
0,"I hate to give any Pita Jungle 1 star, I loooooooooove pita jungle!  But this place deserves it. \n\nI went here last Saturday with my sister and a friend. \n\nOur waitress was quick to take our drink order. At that time we placed an order for some hummus to snack on while we waited as they were super busy. Our drinks were delivered, but no hummus...we figure it will be out any moment....10 minutes go by and some other person comes to our table with our lunch order sans hummus...The waitress shows up and we ask if we could still have the hummus we ordered, she acted as if we just asked her to do something out side of her job description. Then my sister and I dig into our food, we both ordered the same exact thing and we both asked for chicken in our salads, neither of our salads had chicken. When we brought this to our waitresses attention she got all mad and huffed and puffed and we just told her to make sure we didn't get charged for the chicken as we didn't receive it. \n\nShe really sucked. Every time she came to our table she acted like a big bitch. \n\nThe waitress that was waiting on the section next to us was dressed in an outfit that was so ridiculous. Tank top, cowboy boots and shorts that were SO SHORT you could seriously almost see her lady parts. \n\nThis is not an over exaggeration, I don't even own bathing suits that short. This chick could have hit up the beach for a tan and not gotten any tan lines, that's how short these shorts were. She was barley covered and I was thankful she was not our waitress as I didn't want any rouge hairs in my meal. I can not believe that the PJ allows their wait staff to dress however they want with out any set reasonable guidelines. \n\nTHe food was awesome, the experience...not so much."
1,"Every time me and my husband come to Las Vegas, we make sure we stay at least one night! UGH!! I love this place! thanks to my bff we found this place..the people are nice, they got the good slots and the rooms are great, good views....we stayed there last night and we didn't want to leave! Ill be back boo!"
1,"My favorite neighborhood bar. I used th hang there every Tuesday... wait, does that make me sound bad? LOL  Great laid-back atmosphere, cool people to play pool with, bartenders and staff have been there a long time and are awesome. Now I go there on Saturday nights for The Shop (Hip Hop party with Al Page) A great place to hang on Saturday nite and hear some great music."
0,"Ok, I tried this place not once or twice but 3 times and it just is terrible.\nI can't believe with all the different varieties of stuff they offer that the sandwich has so little in it.\nWe went with coupons each time and even with a free sandwich it just isn't worth it.\nThe staff are not the friendliest. They made us feel like we were inconveniencing them by being there.\nOn the 3rd visit I found hair in my sandwich and after showing it to the worker he said I had already taken a bite so he would not re-make it. It does say right on their cup that if you aren't satisfied to take it back up to them and they will re-make it but surely they did not which is false advertisement.\n I did send a e-mail through the website stating what happened on the 3rd visit and did 2 days later did get a e-mail from the store manager saying they hoped I would give it another try.  \nWe will never give it another try we gave it 3 honest tries and never ever again. \nI can get a sandwich that tastes fresher and is filled with way more meat and toppings from Subway for $5.\nI do like the concept of the brown bags and marking in what you want with a sharpie but that is about it.\nThey do have a stamp card for every sub you buy and offer double stamps on a certain day but I threw mine in the trash as I didn't even see it worth it to give away.\nI do not recommend trying this place In-N-Out burger is not too far just go there!"
1,"Get their 3 tacos deal with a drink for $4.99.\nThey have happy hour on Tuesdays after 2pm.\n\nThis place has friendly service.. very friendly, imo :).\nPotato's not bad. I like their fish and beef tacos."
0,"We stayed a few nights at The M resort last weekend which by the way was an amazing experience in its own! (Review to follow) And after a long day in the pool we decided to have a late dinner at the Hash House. The service was great very attentive waiter very nice service. We decided to eat in the patio since this was a Saturday they had the live concert out side so we got to eat and watch the show at the same time which was cool. The portions were HUGE!!! I could not believe it one burger could have feed 2 of us for sure! My father got the Burger which he said was pretty damm good, my mother got something smothered in gravy which she also was OK, my husband got the pancakes which were ginormous but not that great in taste and I got the chicken sand-which which lacked flavor and was just dry and nasty. The only thing that was pretty damm good but I know is a heart-attack on a plate was loaded mash potatoes. All in all this place was just OK for me nothing special and the portions are quite ridiculous. If I was back at The M resort I probably wouldn't go back to this spot. The buffet food was 100 times better then this place for sure!"
0,"The concierge at the Green Valley Ranch recommended this place...Wasn't impressed, came for dinner on a Wednesday night. Super crowded and it was 9 pm. Got more of a diner-like atmosphere rather than a fine dining establishment.  A (get'em in get 'em out, gotta turn these tables as soon as we can) vibe. \n\nWhen we made the reservations asked for a table at the window at 8:30 to watch the fountain show, when we arrived we were told it was going to be another 15 minutes for \""that\"" table wasn't ready. It's okay, no big deal just seat us somewhere else. Which he did immediately.\nHost was very pleasant, warm and friendly. \n\nSat down had a partial view of the fountain, but didn't feel like we had any privacy. Too close of quarters with the couples next to us.\n\nServer was devoid of any personality, maybe she just was having a bad day. But so was the Sommelier. Looked unhappy to be there.  The guy pouring our water was more outgoing and friendly and had a smile on his face than those 2 ever did.\n\nWe took a pass on the apps, since nothing looked too appealing, I had the Mama Egi's ravioli, it was good, sauce was better.  \n\nMy partner had the sea bass, thought it was going to be Chilean Sea Bass but when it arrived, it wasn't, and sent it back. It looked like 2 pieces of fried perch on top of a bunch of beans with escarole. I HATE sending food back and tried to avoid it, but ordered the salmon instead, much better choice. \nNot a place I would recommend. Way too overrated.\n\n3:Food\n2:Service"
1,So I was here w/ a few friends watching the C's/Lakers game a few weeks ago and I'm drinking a 1/2 yard of Pabst.  Well..we're about pretty much done w/ our 1st round of beers and looking to order some food when I accidentally tipped my pretty much empty 1/2 yard glass over shattering it on the table.  4 staff people hurry to the table like there's a virus on the loose and clean everything up in 45 seconds...AND THEN they offer us a free round on them because they're worried about glass in the beers.  \n\nWait..didn't I break the glass??  Weren't our beers pretty much done??  How are we getting rewarded for this??  Ummmm..ok..SURE!!!\n\nSo 5 stars for the service!!  I guess if you're hard up for cash and want a free round that you could intentionally break a glass there....
0,"My cousin, husband and I came to this place because the Main Street Station buffet had a super long line.  Bad idea.  The service was terrible.  The waitress took forever and did not give a rat's a** that she did.  We all ordered the Choice Cut Ribeye Steak.  Huge mistake!  I got the teriyaki style and my cousin and husband got the cowboy broiled steaks.  You could definitely tell these were cheap steaks.  I mean seriously cheap like found dead on the road or something.  Terrible, terrible tasting!  And what teriyaki sauce??  I mean can't they just get it from the jar?  Ugh seriously one of the worst steaks we have ever tasted.  The baked potatao was bleh and the green beans were soft and mushy.  I guess I should have known when I seen the sour cream come in a packet.  I gave this place one star for the beer.  I got the High Roller Gold which was pretty good."
1,"5 stars and a 40% tip. It was that good.\n\nSmith & Wollensky was the decided restaurant for dinner for a friend's bachelorette party before a night out of club crawling. I mentioned to the host that we needed to be somewhere by 9:30pm. He completely respected my wishes to keep this a secret from the Bachelorette and guaranteed me that we could be out by 9pm. As we left, the host was also helpful in helping us grab a taxicab. \n\nBOTTOM LINE IS: The service was absolutely phenomenal. Every wait staff was very friendly, our bill was split with no questions asked, the waiter offered to take a group picture of us, politely reminded us that we should order soon so we get out of their in time, water was filled regularly, as well as being checked up on regularly, AND we received free shots for the party. \n\nThe ribeyes were cooked perfectly - succulent and juicy. The truffle mac & cheese was to die for. The rosemary bread provided at the table was a great start to the meal."
0,"We shopped at Furniture Row a few months ago, looking for a new couch and king sized bed and frame. We found everything we really liked there, and were happy to purchase at the prices given.\n\nOur couch arrived on schedule, but our bed only arrived with the frame, which was odd because we were told they would all arrive together. We were then told our mattress had to be 'made' because they 'ran out'. It took another 3 weeks before the king sized mattress actually arrived. I do love the mattress and frame, however, so I am giving this review higher than a one.\n\nOnto the couch. The couch came in and was great, until we learned it had stuffing instead of pillows inside, meaning we couldn't really ever remove the stuffing to wash the removable cases. Seems pointless to have a zipper if you won't ever use it. Then about 4 months into use, the cushions started bunching up and being wrinkly. We went back to the Furniture Row to ask if there was something that could be done, three times...\n\nOn every occasion, a sales person lied to our face by saying they would contact their 'regional manager' and he would get back to us, but there was probably nothing they could do. He has not contacted us yet in over a month.\n\nShort version: My bed is really nice, my couch is less than stellar, and their logistics and customer service are amazingly bad. Would not suggest using this company if you expect to ever need customer service help."
1,"This place was my savior when my washing machine packed in between Christmas and New Year. A time of year when repairs do not happen quickly because everyone is too busy eating, drinking and being merry. And quite rightly so! \n\nSo I hurried in here with a bag full of washing and the nice lady took it off me and told me to come back the next day. When I went back everything was cleaned and folded perfectly. It was like having my mum do my laundry again! I used the launderette a couple of times afterward, and occasionally when I come back from a trip and can't be chewed washing and drying a suitcase of clothes. Every time the clothes come back clean (which is the main thing I guess!) and nicely folded. It is nice to have folded laundry now and again! \n\nThis place always has bags and bags full of nicely folded laundry, so I guess it is pretty popular and I can see why."
0,"Save your money, and don't go here.\nThis place is so stuck up!\nWe went in there, and walked the entire store, and NOT A SINGLE person acknowledged us. The sales people were NOT busy, chit chatting with each other about outside of work topics.\n\nNo thanks."
1,"I am from Harrisburg, PA, about an hour or so drive from Philly.  This is the absolute closest I have tasted to an actual Philadelphia cheese steak.  My husband and I love this place.  The guys I work with also now love this place.  The workers are friendly and glad you came in.   The steak sandwich - perfect, the bun is great, mine is always steak, muchrooms and cheese.  My husband perfers the works the largest they have.  The fries are great, just as everyone else has said.  I would definately recommend this place to everyone.  Oh, that's right I already have, remember I mentioned my work.  We cant eat here enough."
0,"We suffered a very sorry meal at this allegedly highly rated restaurant.  The butternut squash tasted like almond paste.  My husband's crab claws arrived at the table, hardly cracked.  After serving us, the waiter disappeared and my husband had to get up from the table to ask for a claw cracker.  The waiter returned quickly enough, full of apology.  Apparently, this establishment expects their patrons to dig the crab out of the legs with a dinner fork and knife.  While the waiter was well-versed on the selection of fish available, when he was asked the size of the stone crab claws, he replied \""a half pound\"".   The standard answer at restaurants whose specialty is stone crabs is \""small, medium or large\""......FAIL.   The owner would be well-advised to clean the carpeting and find an air freshener that doesn't smell like stale socks.   On the upside, the view of the city is incomparable.  Wish the food and service was close."
0,"Food can be iffy some times. \nI usually order piccatta, and the one and only time I had their veal, it was very tough. \n\nFood is over priced, the atmosphere is the only thing going for this place.\n\nStaff needs to be upgraded and trained all around.\nIn personality, service, and knowledge. \n\nWent to the bar and asked for a mojito. Bartender said she \""couldn't\"" make it. When the manager (I believe his name is Mike or something... blonde.... light complexion.) came around and asked how we were doing, I had brought up the bartender not having the supplies to make drinks... Like a full bar should. He challenged me, by letting me know that they have fresh mint and it is capable.\n\nWell, I got my 'mojito'. \nMakes me wonder if the bartender was telling me she couldn't make it because of the mint.... or that she COULDN'T make it...... because...... gag.\n\nLast June, I set up a birthday of about 16 for my husband's birthday. I made a reservation at least a week in advance. Waiter / busser would throw the bag of bread on the table, and then hide. They could barely be found. Had to beg for refills.\n\n\nWe have had one great waiter in the 3 years we have been eating there, and that is only because I took my pregnant self and spoke to the manager and complained hardcore. He told me to make a reservation with him, he comp'd our meal, and I'm sure that is why we were treated so nice."
1,"Great atmosphere! Love the fact the owner utilizes his security to quiet down those obnoxious loud table talkers!! Drinks are good & not watered down! The cocktails & domestic beers are a bit pricey, but it wouldn't keep me from going back!"
1,"Went here while bodyguarding a client. I'm a spoiled man who has all the dirty work done for him before the shrimp comes out but here, I was forced into a corner to eat here and on top of that, they ordered for me. Really wasn't into heads and legs on shrimp before I walked in the door but let me tell you that my opinion had soon changed. The food was amazing, spicy, and hands on. The shrimp bag and sausage was THEE best combo I've had in a while. Had some fried shrimp also and it was good. Wonderful waitresses although I couldn't keep my eyes off of one in perticular, and this waitress made me try crawfish which wasn't bad either. Great experience. Great environment. Great food. Great time. Will always eat here in Vegas especially if I catch this waitress working"
1,I had an outdoor water leak. Called them to schedule appointment with a very friendly lady. They showed up when they said they would handled and fixed the problem quickly and professionally. They then sent a nice thank you card along with a Starbucks gift card in the mail with was a very nice touch. Nice to deal with a well run classy business!
1,"This is my go to store. Customer Service is great but some times, the food is expired. They have great deals all the time and you no longer have to worry about having to sign up for a card, the discount is given no matter what."
1,"I'm afraid I have to lower Canaletto a peg.  It may have just been mainly what I ate this time.  Homemade light Minestrone Di Verdura Soup was good; Insalata Cesarina with a light Caesar Dressing was excellent; and crusty Italian bread and rolls were really good with butter.  Roasted Potatoes were very good, as well.  But what was supposed to be the piece de resistance--a whole salt-encrusted Branzino--was just a very moist but rather bland fish.  And, once it was deboned, it reduced down to a smaller edible portion than I expected.  Plus, I still wound up with 4 bones in my mouth on different bites.\n\nService was otherwise excellent; the ambiance on the patio of The Venetian's St. Mark's Square with electronic violins playing nearby was very nice; and Crespelle Di Mele was once again an excellent dessert, with Colombina al Cioccolato very good as well, as a second sweet ending for my party of four.\n\nBut next time I will return to mussels and pasta!"
0,"We walked in and the place was empty except for one other couple. The hostess/waitress was vacuuming and then mopping the entire place while we were there. They close in an hour. Could it wait until your customers are gone? Finally, the waitress/hostess/ poor woman cleaning was sick as a dog! She was coughing while she vacuumed, coughing while she mopped and coughing while she brought out our food! She should not be serving food to customers let alone working! She was very sweet and we felt bad for the review but she should be in bed. Food was fine but if it comes with a cold..... Yuck!"
0,"Okay, I was super excited about this place when I finally realized what it was while we were in the drive-through.  I wasn't excited however about their complicated menu.  I did the build your own combo thing and I just wanted a single patty cheeseburger with bacon on it.  I got the cheese curds as a side because... well how could I not.  Fried cheese.  After pulling past the pay window we waited for a good 7-10 minutes for our food.  That was irritating.  I like the whole made-to-order thing, but Jack In the Box manages to do it faster.  I gobbled up all my cheese curds within moments.  Ya, they were really good.  There was a mix of white and yellow cheese in there.  The flavor of them was just delicious.  Unfortunately, my burger was all sorts of wrong.  I opened the wrapping to find a ridiculously misshapen double cheeseburger inside.  I wanted one less patty and some bacon.   I guess that was too much to ask.  Anyway, it looked unappetizing based off of the strangely shaped patties and the fact that it was so greasy I couldn't get my hands to grip it without crap falling out the other end.  I probably wouldn't go back unless I was just getting a snack.  The cheese curds are great, but that's about it."
0,"I will NEVER go to this salon again to get any service.  I have been a customer of this nail salon for over a year.  Last week I called to schedule an appointment.  After waiting 20 minutes with feet soaking & water now cold-I asked how much longer it would be.  The lady beside me said she would be doing my pedi & it would only be a few more minutes.  I understand a delay, but what's the point of making an appt. if you wait that long?  Once she began my pedicure she seemed to be rushing.  I have 3 places on my feet where she rubbed with the pumice so hard that she burned skin off like an abrasion.  This was on Sat, today is Monday & it still hurts & has not healed.  I will find a new salon.  Wish I knew the ladies name & I would post this!!!  I told her it was hurting so she stopped rubbing so damn hard.  After she painted my toes, she put antiseptic on the worst burn-that only made it burn more!!!  Terrible service...unsatisfied"
1,LOVE this place! I've been here several times and will return. Very friendly staff. The place is spotless. I talked to the owner and he was extremely friendly and knowledgable. I got a massage and chiropractic adjustment (the owner is a chiropractor). A++.
1,"This really is the best place to bring your car in AZ!! I drive from North North North Scottsdale just so I can work with Ray! I have a Suburban with a 100K miles. Ray has let's know what to do to keep the car in top working condition. He lets you know what \""can\"" be done on the car and what \""needs\"" to be done. All of which is at a fair price. If you are in search for a mechanic you can trust and build a long term relationship with - you just found your shop!"
0,Horrible... just kill me now. Food/service was horrible. Too much oil in their food.  I got sick from here. =/
1,"Love the food and love the atmosphere(M location is my fav.)  During our last visit, admittedly on a Saturday, the service was less than stellar.  Not usually an issue, but something to consider if visiting on the weekend.  Otherwise what is not to like!"
0,"I wasn't impressed at all with this place. There are WAY better sushis than that in Montreal! I don't get how they don't even have specialized cocktails, yet they serve Pina Coladas...Wine selection is large but very clich\u00e9, nothing special there. We asked the waitress for some food recommendations and she indicated the \""most popular\"" rolls. How about you know your stuff and know exactly what to recommend?\n \nThe sushis had a nice presentation but that's pretty much it. Completely tasteless. And some little annoying details, like Kikkoman soy sauce on the table? What kind of non-fast food restaurant puts cheap Kikkoman soy sauce on the table? At least hide it in some little jar or something.\n \nWe were sitting by the mezzanine and the decor was dull. There was no music...on a Friday night. We had a bad experience overall, will not return. At that price range ($18 a roll), you can and you should get better. I have no problem spending on amazing food but I hate getting screwed."
1,"Let's start at the reservation.  Considering that I had made one about 4 hours before I wanted to arrive and was sucessful at making one ONLINE? That was pretty impressive.  Everything about it was very smooth and gave me no problems, even for a party of 7.\n\nMy friends ordered the French Onion Soup as an appetizer, but I got to try some of it.  It was pretty good, not gonna lie.  I had a very nice texture to it and was definitely still warm while we ate it through.  It was a delicious blend of salty onions, but not too much of anything.\n\nMy friends and I ordered a variety of steaks, all of which were pretty good.  I ordered the Bernaise one, which was pretty good and probably why I gave it the 4 stars.  The meat was medium-cooked as I had ordered it, but my friend who had ordered medium-rare was a little too cooked for it to be considered close to rare.  But other than that the quality of the meat was pretty good, and the difference sauces for the steaks seemed to go well with all of them, although I did wish that my Bernaise sauce was a little stronger and had a little more kick to it.  \n\nService was pretty good; they kept coming back to check up on us, however they were a little pushy on trying to get us to order more, like a bottle of wine, which we did anyways.  I won't comment on the wine because I haven't had much experience with wine, but I thought it tasted fine and pretty good with my steak.\n\nSo, overall\n4-4.5 stars\npretty good quality steak\nexcellent service (reservations included)\nseemed to have a good wine selection"
0,"This is the worst service EVER! It's Saturday and I walked in as the 3rd person to be helped and I've been here over a hour. The salesman has been talking with 1 customer for over 45min and they just left and didn't buy anything he just gave them info, horrible salesman and then he left for break when there are now 10 people waiting. The employees have no sense of urgency and don't know what they're talking about.  I have a business account but changed my personal account to Verizon, thank god.  As soon as my last contract is up I will be done with them.  Beware of Sprint, worst customer service in the industry."
0,"I'm not sure why I thought going to ihop in the first place was a good idea. I went at lunch time, on a weekday because I was craving some pancakes. The place was mostly empty, but they still couldn't be bothered to have good service. I was sat at a table and waited, and waited.. finally after I stared down a waitress was I finally able to place an order. My food came and it was alright, not sure how anyone could mess up pancakes. I didn't see my waitress again until she brought the check. No \""how does your food taste?\"" or \""can I get you anything else?\"" Actually yes, I really wanted a glass of water but I couldn't get one until the check finally came. Avoid this place."
1,"We went last weekend and had a ton of fun.  There were about 5 or 6 trucks and all sounded great. Apparently they rotate the trucks every week, so you can go and get something different each time. \n\nWe got a chicken and rice stew from a Caribbean/African truck and it was excellent. They also had gingerbeer which was so amazing!!!\n\nWe will definitely return."
0,Careful ask for receipt before ordering bottle service. Was quoted 2500 for 4 bottles. They bait and switched and ended up 12k . We walked out careful unethical business. We also had the text with promoter with the quoted price.
0,"Sorry, this was way too expensive for what you got. Our waitress was also a bit misleading when we asked her about the size of the tacos(we asked because we'd been to a place the day before that served happy meal size tacos for way too much.)-she said they were big and filling. I'm now wondering if she said that tongue in cheek cause they were tiny and looked like appetizers. \n\nAnd what's the deal with rice and beans that everybody spoons off from a communal plate, for chrissakes gimme my own plate and make it look appetizing instead of a goopy mess in the middle of everyone. \n\nMy friend got a no frills burrito for $14(nothing else) and a $8 margarita , and also felt ripped off.\n\nI gave it two stars because the hostesses were fun to talk to and the 2 mini seabass tacos I had ($13 with nothing else) were actually amazing. Still wouldn't go back or really recommend the place. Too bad the prices and portions were a joke."
1,Best to visit in August\n\nSix Flags is to California as La Ronde is to Montreal. So if you want to actually spend most of your enjoying the rides get there before noon. \n\nBest Rides:\nVampire\nLe Monster\nGoliath\n\nThe food is overpriced and okay tasting but what do you expect. It's a theme park. You come for the rides not the food.
1,BEST turkey sandwich I have ever had...
0,"This review is in reference to the Minute Clinic that is located inside the CVS Pharmacy. Checked in and waited. We were number 1 in the que.The assumed Nurse at 20min to closing, stuck her head out the door, and in a unpleasant tone told us she could not see us tonight. I shared we had checked in more than thirty minutes before the Closeing time.  To that her reply was .. \""I don't know why the computer let you check in\""... what was sad about the situation was her deminor... There was no sympathy to our situation my daughter has been throwing up all day. She couldn't even take the time out to give us options of other places we could possibly go. All we got was a curt non caring attitude. I can understand if you're having a bad day or you worked a long day, but at least be sympathetic to people situations.  I doubt I'll be returning to this place."
1,"Support your local businesses! With that said, this little pizza shop is close to home. The owner knows me by order. He always greets with kindness and offers me something for free cause hes nice. I've ordered quite a bit from here. Can't go wrong with wings. Chicken Fingers are huge. This one of those places that has awesome ranch! no serious! I usually get a personal pie with an order of wings with fries and it's less then $15. With Pizza Hut and Dominos near by...you just can't get that there. And they taste better than the chains. Go there! For real!"
0,"Oh, I've been meaning to update my review. I totally forgot that for every item we purchased that night, we were charged an extra $.25. Now, by no means am I a cheap individual, but here is where I take issue:\n\n1. The food is already WAY overpriced\n2. Nowhere on their menu (at least the take out menu), does it indicate you will be charged an additional $.25 per item\n3. The individual who rang in my order also never mentioned anything about a $.25 surcharge.\n\nThe only thing I can surmise is that I was being charged a \""to go\"" fee.  I have serious problems with places that do this to their customers. I had a problem with a place like this in Chicago who tried to pull this stunt, but at least they wrote \""to go charge\"" on the bill. The fault was in how they handled the situation after I voiced my displeasure with this wack attempt to sneak a few more coins from my pocket. However, Bunky's just sneaks it in, and if you ask me, that's just bunk."
1,"The ambience in The Chandelier Lounge is crazy amazing.  We got a drink in the middle level, which really gives the whole feeling as if you were inside a giant, crystal chandelier.  Gorgeous decor & design, and great service.  Particularly one cocktailer named Nicole - she was awesome.\n\nExpect your typical, Las Vegas strip, overpriced cocktails, and expect to stand.  But definitely stop by for a drink or two - it really is a beautiful bar."
0,"I use to think this place was really good. My mind changed however once I got a sandwich with bad meat. I'm sure it was a mistake but it should be better looked at. I also have had friends who have worked there and noticed bad meat and the manager said they still had to use it. So I'm not sure if it's just the location or if all jimmy johns are like that. I will say though, their bread is really good"
1,"Smoke smoke smoke!  Needed a place to snag a couple of sticks while I was out with the guy's in the family.  Decent booze selection and LV prices in the humidor, but they did have a reasonable variety.  Would probably stop by again if I'm feeling the need."
1,"SO much fun! I went here last weekend and had a total blast. The staff and crowd are beyond friendly. If you're looking for cheap well made drinks, and a great environment check it out! There is a cover, which doubled as a drink voucher so no big deal. The Drag show on Friday's rocks!! Worth stopping by."
1,Dr. Linder is an outstanding dermatologist. She is thorough and personable.  But I do have a serious problem with the individuals who answer the phone for appointments and the work at the front desk.  They act like they are doing you a favor and I'm never sure if they are truly giving me the first available opening for an appointment.  \n\nOnce I tried to purchase a product but I couldn't remember the exact name of the product. I asked the woman at the front desk to look up my file to see if it was listed. She said that I had never purchased the product from the office.  I knew I had.  I went home found the empty container and took it back.  Low and behold when I showed her the container she was able to find that I had indeed purchased it.  I'm not sure if they are consciously being difficult or just don't care about the quality or lack of customer service. I wish Dr. Linder would take the time to make sure that the individuals who greet her patients and answer the phone behaved as professionally as she does.
0,"Incompetent service? Check! Overworked employees while other employees stand around? Check! Giving you a screwed up order? Check! If you love having your time wasted, then by all means frequent this location as much as possible! If you want good, competent service and accurate orders, visit the many other JJ's in the area.\n\nAfter attempting to send a complaint through JJ's main website, I received an error message (more time wasted!) and my complaint couldn't go through. How convenient for an error message to pop up when filing a complaint!\n\nJJ's food is OK....I consider them ok sandwiches for when your too lazy/busy to drive out and grab lunch (even though they seriously skimp on ingredients!)...I can seriously live without it and will do just that. My office usually orders delivery from them about 3-4 times a month but I told them if they want JJ's in the future, to go order it themselves as I'm done with them. Too many other sandwich places out there to waste my time with JJ's."
1,This is one of the best NY style deli's I have been to! The sandwiches are ginormous and delicious. They definitely don't skimp on the meat! I would recommend this place even to the pickiest New Yorkers. They also have a breakfast that is bomb dot com!
1,There's lots of good things to say about this cafe.\n\n1) Small but lots of seating. Cozy.\n2) Wonderful espresso\n3) Nice baristas\n4) Very convenient location\n5) Prices are competitive\n\nReminds me of cafes that I used to visit a lot when I lived in a smaller city.  I defintely recommend!
1,"My boyfriend and I came here for one of my 21st birthday dinners (we were in Vegas celebrating).\n\nWhen we first entered, there were naked girls with painted flower petals on their boobies sitting in separate bathtubs full of rose petals near the entrance. That was an interesting start! We sat in the lounge and waited for the hostess to take us to our table. It was VERY crowded and noisy with attractive people everywhere. \n\nWe walked past the GIANT buddah near the wall and were seated at one of the many tables. I don't remember most of what we had for dinner by now, but it was cutely presented. I remember some pretty good sushi, seafood, and steak...\n\nMy favorite is the also GIANT fortune cookie filled with chocolate and vanilla mousse topped with tons of tropical fruits."
1,"These are seriously the best workout clothes EVER! They last forever and they fit amazingly in all the right places.  Only workout garb that doesn't bunch, tug, or ride up anywhere.  Free hemming even after you've taken your stuff home. Even my husband now wears it and LOVES it. That is a feat!"
1,"Best place to go, uptown, for all of your eye care needs. Great docs and staff. \nHighly recommend."
1,"My husband and I had great seats (3rd row from the front) and we were able to see all of the performers up close.  KA is set up a little bit differently than all of the other Cirque De Soleil shows, this one had an actual story line.  Each seat has built in speakers so that you can hear the music.  The shadow puppets were a nice touch since that is not something I would have expected but it was done beautifully.  Not everything happens on stage, the performers also use the two sides of the theater for certain scenes.  I really enjoyed this show."
0,"Went here 08/1/2013 place was shut down by the county and the notice said \""Imminent Hazard\"".\n\nit appears they had refrigeration issues but still chose to stay open. Think about that. Sushi with out proper refrigeration? (Vomits). Never again, if you come here after knowing this you deserve a stomach virus.  They obviously don't care."
1,"I've now been to Pizza Rock twice. First things first, why not 5 stars? Basically because I've been here twice and I have never been told that locals receive 20% off their bill. What the heck Pizza Rock? I don't typically go around asking, Hey can I get a local discount? But. When I've been here twice and sung its praises to people - and yet, I've been able to get 20% off but haven't? Arg. That ruffles my feathers.\n\nOn to what is GOOD. Happy hour is awesome. Personal pizzas, apps, well drinks, and cocktails all on the cheap. My friends and I came here during HH and split all three of the personal pizzas and shared the meatballs. Okay. I'm no meatball expert but I think these are delicious. Meaty, not bready, and the sauce it comes with compliments very well. I also like that these meatballs are simple. I've had way too many meatballs that have way too much going on with them. Another reason I like them: you can cut them down the middle with your fork and they fall away in two pieces, not a bunch of lumpy, gross meat pieces. Quality. I think.\n\nOther than HH.... I came here with my hubby on a Saturday night. Luckily they have plenty of 2-top tables so we were seated quickly. Service was quick and to the point. Our server neither impressed me or upset me so I'll give a neutral rating for service.\n\nWhat we ordered... The New Yorker 23. It was the one pizza on the menu I figured my picky (and rather plain-Jane) husband would enjoy. The New Yorker comes with: Sliced Mozzarella, Tomato Sauce, Sliced House Link Sausage, Garlic, Pepperoni, Ricotta. I asked for the link sausages to be removed and replaced with mushrooms. They were happy to oblige. Under the menu it says, \""Winner, Best Traditional, Las Vegas\"". I'm not sure what that means.\n\nOverall thoughts on the pizza... I enjoyed it. I love the thin crust style. The mix of cheese and sauce was perfect. Pepperoni... Okay. The Ricotta cheese was an awesome addition, creamy and slightly sweet offsetting the heartiness of the pepperoni and garlic. The flavors were that of a \""normal\"" pizza, but with a refinement. I think this was a perfect way to satisfy my more adventurous side and my husband's more traditional side.\n\nFinal decision: Mine and my husband's dinner was a bit pricey. Although delicious, I would rather go back for the happy hour. HH is your best bet here. And ya, go ahead and throw in the fact you're a local. You'll probably get a discount, unlike me. I'd also be interested in just heading up to the take out window to take a slice to go.\n\nOther things I want to go back for:\n\nTheir Margherita (only 73 made per day)\nClam and Garlic Pizza\nLa Regina (The Gold Cup Winner)\nQuail Egg White Rose Potato Guanciale Pizza\nCal Italia (again, this comes as one of the Personal Pizzas on HH menu and is a FoodNetwork winner)\nThe Chorizo Mussels (App)\nAnd I would come back again for the meatballs.\n\nLooks, like I'll be making a few return trips. The great thing is, I am so happy there is a good, inventive pizza place so close to where I live now."
1,"My favorite car rental place !\n\nPROS:\n\n1. Easy location to find.\n2. Large facility offering all rental car companies to choose from.\n3. Short lines.\n4. Easy check in and payments.\n5. Many cars to choose from.\n6. I absolutely love how they just let you walk into the rental car parking lot and choose any car you want. So you get the opportunity to look at a few different cars before you choose one.\n7. Every car has the key inside, so just pick one and drive out!\n8. Easy car rental return. Simply park the car back into the lot, give them the keys and just leave!\n9. Workers here are friendly and happy!\n\n\nCONS:\n\n1. Building layout might get a little confusing."
0,"Poor customer service...  Staff members are rude.   There was miscommunication with a voucher my guests and I had and what the server clarified at the beginning.  It was a different story when my guests and I got the bill.  The rude gestures came from a male also working at the restaurant (was at the front counter most of the time), when he started insulting my guests stating, \""can you not read?\"" and other inappropriate remarks.       \n\nI enjoyed the food I had (#4) and I was looking for catering options for an event in Charlotte.  I asked if an exception could be made since we were wanting to be returning customers, the male worker said he'd ask the manager... turns out the manager was only on the phone and was a very quick phone call.     \n\nDecided to go to this location since it was closer than the Dilworth chain. (rude gentleman worker said that both locations are owned by same person.  is this true?) \n\nI will definitely not be coming back or doing any business with this restaurant again.  I do not recommend dining in at Pio Pio."
0,"This is an awful insurance company. They lure you into signing with them, they are very kind at getting your credit card number and making you a costumer, but when they call you to collect a remaining balance larger than what the insurance company is able to pay and you contact them hoping that they have an answer, it was a mistake on their part or something of the sort- they leave you hanging and say you should have read everything carefully and called if you had questions. In an insurance company as limited as this one, they should make the effort to reach out to their costumers and one on one inform them of their benefits as well as of their responsibilities as a patient so that when you receive a call from a collection company about lab work that was done to you requested by your doctor who is well aware of your insurance policy, you don't feel like you have been scammed; or better yet you never receive a collectors call because you are well informed of your plan. What is the point of paying for insurance month to month to be left with a bill that is higher than what your insurance will cover? If you didn't have insurance, the doctor and the lab would be very cautious as to express to you the total in numbers of the work you are getting done, prior to getting it done- or simply would avoid performing such work because you don't have the right insurance or money. It's an absolute scam from all parts of the healthcare system and it really is unfortunate that the only liable person is the patient who was played by all parts. Health Plan of Nevada is a scam along with physicians and laboratories who play the game."
0,The hot and sour fish cost $24.99 not $7.45 light the guy say. Service is really bad.
0,"I get it. She wasn't going to sing much (she didn't sing at all), but I would have at least appreciated some effort from Britney, you know, since she had all the energy saved by not singing. The dancers worked harder than she did (they also looked more interested in being there than she did). Disappointed to spend any amount of money to see someone flail their arms for 90 minutes and get carried around by their dancers. Hey Britney, take your own advice, you better work, bitch."
0,"Ok, I have a few hours to kill between work and class so I stop by Babe's Sports Grill off Shea and Scottsdale Rd. For a beer and quick snack while watching the Magic/Knicks game\n\nFirst imprssion...kinda dive, and old looking, but since this is a new place I guess that's what management wanted. Michelle, my upbeat server,  told me it was $2 Tuesday and ran off the specials. I asked for a 4 Peaks...we don't serve that. Ok, how 'bout a Killian's....nope. Sam Adams??? Sorry. Holy crap! What kind of sports bar is this?\n\nMichelle, my perky and buxsom server, did her best to encourage me to try some other drafts, but I reluctantly went with (shudder) Fat Tire. on Michelle's advice that tacos were $2, I ordered 3...2 pork and one fish along with \""tha hottest sauce you have back there\"". A few minutes later, there they were. I dipped my finger into the sauce and tasted, you guessed it, wing sauce...and not the ultra nuclearmeltdown verioun either. Most Hispanics could feed this in place of mother.s milk and even a few gringos would probaly say...wtf? Anyway, yes there was heat, but hey we're in AZ, Dorothy.\n\nThe tacos themselves were ok. The fish was moist and had pretty good flavor. Then I took a bite of the pork. Now, I'm a chef and I couldn't wrap my head around that surprising taste. So I took another bite. Waiaminuite...could it be? Awwww, Hell no! Thatis bbq sauce or something! On a pork taco??? \n\nI'm done . Go to the men's room and am greeted by the police mug shots of famous athletes wh ran afoul of the law.geez, great touch. Check please."
0,"Okay, here is the only review you need.  I have been going to this buffet for more than a decade, possibly since its inception when the cost was $16.99, and also hold platinum membership at the Rio.  At that time the lobster and crab legs alone made this place for worth the cost. Then the cost went to $19.99, $24.99, 29.99, and $34.99.  All the while the quality increased at least in proportion with the cost. They added clams, an entire sushi bar, and always had high quality, fresh seafood no matter the preparation.  So, I recently visited once again in March 2008 to find that the buffet was under construction. I was disappointed since this is one of the reasons for my travel to the Rio. However I understood it was probably going to be a nice upgrade so anticipated a subsequent visit. I traveled to this RIo, stayed in an upgrade suite, and went to the buffet that night of arrival. Good night! MAJOR DOWNGRADE. Sushi bar cut in half as to selection, and freshness gone. Lobster - absolute disappointment! They were as small as crawdads and my company mentioned that they were in fact crawdads, and NO I did not mix them up with the crawdad section. Crab legs? Smaller than average and dirt and grime all over the shells, like they were just caught out of filthy infested waters. They upgraded the furniture like some sort of modern city joint - not the nice homely place it was. So to sum this up the buffet is worth $24.99 - not a dime more! Poor quality and lower than average. Better food at Todai, or Onami - franchise type seafood buffets. Side note - rooms poor quality, so overall perhaps this was recessionary effect."
1,Frontier Ace Hardware is one of my favorite stores in AJ! I don't buy much hardware but the times I have been in found the employees to be friendly & helpful. Wish the prices were a bit lower & wonder if they will price match the larger hardware stores? If they would I would gladly shop there more.
1,"I love Gullifty's!!! Its a really excellent place to get some dinner or dessert with your friends before a night out or just to spend some time catching up. \n\nFriday and Saturday nights can have a little bit of a wait, so be prepared for that. The desserts are way better than some of the reviewers here give them credit for and they have a really excellent wide variety to choose from. \n\nPrivate lot in the back as well as street park all require coins for the meter (pain!) but, when i'm back in pittsburgh about once a year, a stop to gullifty's is always on my to-do list!"
1,"Simple Menu. Great Food. Burrito, Burrito Bowl, Tacos, or Salad- four meats or vegetarian- ranging from $5.50 -$6.10. Needed something fast before we were picking up our new furniture at nearby Lawrence's; this fit the bill. We came here once before, but my husband didn't like it. This time he liked it!\n\nChoose the meat- chicken, steak, barbacoa (naturally raised beef), carnitas (pork) or vegetarian. Choose the burrito, burrrito bowl, tacos or salad. I really liked my chicken salad. Romaine greens, topped with medium roasted chili-corn salsa, mild- pico de gallo, chipotle chicken, peppers & onions, corn, and shredded cheese and the side of chipotle-honey vinaigrette. There was so much flavor from both salsas and the peppers & onions, that I really didn't put too much additional salad dressing. (You can get it with sour cream and avocado but I thought it was fine.) It was soooo good- I finished it. My husband got the carnitas burrito- he called it a two fister- it's huge, I would probably only eat half. He really enjoyed it. (He got steak the first time, but it was dry so he didn't like it.)\n\nI recently reviewed Baja Fresh as possibly being my favorite Mexican chain restaurant, but I think that I like Chipotle better. There is a kids menu ranging from $2.95-$3.95- quesadillas, taco, or taco kit (they build it- really neat!). Also, maragaritas & beer available ($2.75- $3.50). Sides are chips & salsa, guacamole ($1.50). Free refills on soda. The inside, which is industrial feeling, reminds me of Hash House A Go Go. The staff is fast and friendly, and the inside is very clean."
1,"A wonderland of food.  I normally do not like buffet food, because I wind up getting one plate, and I'm done.  At this place, I got seconds and thirds, and it even had a good selection for my vegetarian friends."

0,"HORRIBLE! \n\nNo Wonder Sears as a company is failing. My husband needed new tires on his 08 Acura TL and we decided to go here since it was close and heard in the past it was good to go with Sears for tires. \n\nWell, this experience was a poor, poor one. Hubby had picked out the exact tires that he wanted on-line and we went in the store to purchase/order them. We went in on a Sunday around noon-ish and there was no one around when we walked in. (no sales ppl or customers) So we waited. Probably about 10 min or so until a sales associate came out to help. \n\nThis guy was rude and didn't really know what he was doing. He got an attitude with us because we were trying to ask a couple of questions about the tires. Hubby gave him the print out of the tires he had picked out on-line so it would be easy to look up and order.  We were there for about 30 min. ordering the tires. In the meantime, other customers came in and waited. No other sales associate can out to help. So I felt sorry for everyone that had to wait around for us to finish up. \n\nNext, when we finally got them ordered, the total came out to be around $400 MORE than what was totaled online. Beware that the total online is a few hundred bucks short of what they actually cost. \n\nAfter all of that, hubby scheduled an appointment the next day to get his tires installed which was fast. (this is the only positive part of this process). Hubby went in the next morning around 8 am and didn't leave until 3 PM!!!!! He was there for 7 HOURS. This was also due to them installing the WRONG TIRES!!! \n\nMy hubby is very patient and I can not believe how well he handled it. \n\nI will never ever go here again! I hope this is a warning to anyone looking to get new tires here. \n\n\nP.S. 1 month later, my car needed new tires and I went to Discount Tire on W. Flamingo and I was in and out in under 1 hour and they cost the EXACT same amount that was quoted online!"

1,"I joined the crew last night for the HH organized by the fabulous Christina P. Although it was my first visit and I generally like to sample a place a few times before reviewing, there were so many of us there that I felt that I had gotten a pretty well-rounded experience and had enough information to provide input. \n\nPhoenix is known for its host of strip mall restaurants, but few can actually transport you to another place. The restaurant interior is a mix of kitschy Italian and moderately nice mainstream. The main patio is actually about the same size as the restaurant interior and is flanked by two cute NYC street scenes (think universal studios city scene) with each window telling a different story and the Statue of Liberty holding court. Very quaint! The back of the patio is taken up by a complete bar. The fire pit that others have mentioned is situated in the middle. The patio is clearly the place to be at this venue!\n\nService was spot on, which was unexpected for such a large group. I have to echo Georgie S., the bartender seemed to single handedly (with the exception of bussing support) kept our brood quenched and fed with no errors. He asked each guests name upon their initial order and remembered them throughout the remainder of the evening. No simple feet, if you consider that we had at least 20 people in our party and he was also serving the numerous other guests that shared our al fresco setting.\n\nThe manager Matt, came out to thank us for coming by and informed us that there is a separate patio in the back to accommodate private parties/functions. What a divine setting for almost any family or business gathering!\n\nIn addition to the ambience and service, there is the food... Oddly one of the best things of the evening was the free appetizer provided to each table, which consists of bread and a parmesan/pesto dipping sauce that is so infused with garlic that its sweet fragrance swirls in the air. Now as Bacon B. points out, this will stay with you (i.e.: if you are on a date, you should both eat some) but it is seriously out of this world! I also really enjoyed the bruschetta, which is a classic take on the dish in every aspect except size. More often than not you will receive four or six small slices of toast with some tomatoes and basil carefully assembled on top, but not here... instead you will be served a small flatbread mounded with fresh hand cut tomatoes, chiffonades of basil and more of that dreamy garlic.\n\nI was also able to sample two of the new pizza offerings. The Roberto's (ironically offered up by the fabulous Robert M.), which was set off by a sprinkling of pepperocinis offering just a little kick, and the White pizza which had more of those rich garlic undertones. Although I enjoyed the toppings on each of the pizzas, I was left wanting more from the crust. Both were uniform in size and shape and a little on the tough / dense side, which made me wonder if they were not made in house. That said, it was not enough to detract from the overall experience and I will definitely be back in the near future."
1,"BIG fan of this all-suite hotel at the better end of the Las Vegas strip. Let me count the ways:\n\nThe rooms - Since it's also the property of The Venetian Hotel & Casino, the suites are similar in design with 2 queen beds, a sunken den with it's own LCD screen, pull-out sofa bed and wrap around couch, double-door entrance to the restroom with LCD screen TV  above the mirror, 2 sinks and toilet area with its own door & phone. Very spacious suite. I've seen the bigger suites which have a double door entrance, full bar and separate bedroom and living area. Very nice... These rooms are quite updated from the rooms at The Venetian. They use a darker marble and the suite, in general, looks a little more modern and refined. \n\nThe pool - Love the Palazzo pool. Even when staying at the Venetian we find our way to the Palazzo pool. The pool areas of both of these hotels are connected so you can shuttle back and forth. Kids pool, big wading pool, smaller side pools and jacuzzi area. Cafe right at the entrance allows you to order sandwiches and salads to eat nearby. There's a full bar for drinks and there's the Azure pool party if you want to hear music and avoid the craziness at Tao Beach in the summertime. Pool attendants are helpful in securing you a lounge chair and towels.\n\nGrand Lux Cafe - This place is open 24-7. There's a Grand Lux also in the Venetian but it closes around midnight. So if you've ever been in Vegas and are hungry for a decent meal after the club, it's such a luxury to have a restaurant with the consistency of Grand Lux in your hotel. My daytime meal of choice is the kids meal of hand-battered chicken strips. Always hits the spot. And it's by no means a kids sized portion. Good stuff. There's a take-out counter so it's very convenient for ordering food and drinks.\n\nThe club - Lavo is always a good time. A roman bathhouse themed nightclub. Sound is great, lights are dope and it's a lot smaller than Tao so it's usually not as crazy. DJ Skratchy is our favorite DJ there. He definitely keeps the crowd movin. And if you wanna have a chill drink, Lavo lounge downstairs has an outdoor patio over looking the Strip and directly across from TI and its pirate show. Always a great option.\n\nValet parking - Never a long wait. Pickup is underground (with misters to keep you cool) so you're not exposed to the Vegas heat as much in the summertime. There's also an air conditioned waiting room if it gets too hot. \n\nAlways a good time staying here, as a whole... Never disappoints. Thank you Palazzo."
1,"Damn. If we truly are what we eat, I'm in trouble.\n\nAnyone that reads my reviews knows I hold Matt's Big Breakfast at the top tier of breakfast places. Every time I go to Matt's I get friendly service and PERFECT breakfast...and they are the only place in the Valley that get's the 5 stars for breakfast (at least in my book). \n\nThat being said, we have been to Oink Cafe a few times and are impressed. \n\nThis is a bacon place. They have about 8 different kinds of bacon, and all are really yummy. \n\nThe Omelettes are pretty damned good, I have to say. The Country Potatoe's are really good, as well. The egg and meat (think bacon) dishes are very good. \n\nSo, if you can't make it to Matt's, come here. They're on to something, and it's very, very good."
0,"Happy hour drinks were overpriced and under poured, the service on the patio was super slow and unprofessional, and the appetizers were bland.\n\nThe lone bright spot was the walleye appetizer. I would go back for that but will most definitely sit at the bar for quicker service."
0,"Overpriced!  I was very surprised at the expensive buffet price.  Around $80 for three of us on a Wednesday night.  Same price for a weekday night as a Friday or Saturday. It was late and we were hungry, and couldn't decide on what we wanted so we gave it a go.  Terrible! Let's start with the salad. It was a little wilted and browning on the edges. (not terrible if you cover with dressing and cheese)\nThere was a cold turkey or chicken (can't remember) dish near the salads that was pretty tender and good. Next stop my favorite Crab Legs! They were terrible! Decent sized, I guess. But they tasted as if they had been slightly opened and submerged in water for several days.  Soggy and tasteless. I've never had soggy crab legs. It was disgusting. Even drowning in butter didn't help this mess. \n\nPrime Rib was ok. No real complaints there. \nHowever, I was really disappointed that they didn't have Banana Cream Pie, that's like a buffet staple. Instead I had a fruit torte and a carrot cup cake.  Both were pretty good. The dessert station definitely looked the best.\n\nThey do have a $10 add on for all you can drink. If you eat here, I think you should go for the all you can drink, because maybe being drunk will help the food taste better.  Also, the soda was terrible. It seemed like the carbonation was out, but they changed it and it was still not good. They also wouldn't give us bottled water \""because we weren't Diamond Plus  members\""  Ridiculous!"
0,"I give this joint two stars, mainly for service.  Staff wasn't overly friendly, but they were attentive and efficient.  Zero stars for food.  Chips were ok, but only one of the three salsas they brought was tasty.  It seemed like they were trying to be original with their unique salsas, but something just went wrong and they weren't good.  I had the Baja fish tacos, which were the worst I've ever had.  The fish was ok, but bland.  The tortillas were pasty, like they were undercooked.  The rice could have been Rice-a-Roni, but it wasn't even that good.  The beans were the one thing I ate most of.  My friend had fajitas, and the meat was tough.  They brought her tortillas wrapped up in a cloth napkin, that kept them warm for about two minutes.  All that combined with weird lighting, which gave the place a cool atmosphere but made the food look even less appetizing (a green light right above the table?) just made the entire experience bad.  I won't try this place again."
0,"So after a long Vegas night of gambling and a magic show, and convincing the old man not to empty out our savings we head out of the MGM to the car.  I wanted to sober up my guy a little and convince him why not spending the rest of our money at ANOTHER casino was a good thing so I turned to Yelp to help me in my quest.  Mad Onion came up.  It was inside the Hooters casino so I figured at least the pretty girls will distract him from the poker cards, but, alas, there wasn't any!  Where did they all go?\n\nWe went inside the Mad Onion and were seated after 5 minutes (it was dead, so I don't know why we had to wait).  We started out with the shrimp cocktail and onion soup.  The shrimp cocktail was good, but the onion soup wasn't.  It had barely any soup, in fact, it was just soggy bread and cheese.  He ordered the pork chops and I ordered the Cajun Prime Rib.  Pork Chops weren't cooked all the way.  The HUGE portion of mashed potatoes for the side wasn't bad, but they didn't give us any gravy for them.  The cajun prime rib was way over seasoned and salty.  I kept wondering where our waiter was, too (I needed more water to wash down the salty food).  I think we wasted around $80 here.\n\nAfter we were done, we had to wait forever for valet (it was dead, people!).  I don't plan on coming here again."

1,Great pizza this one is better than the other one in Pasadena wish this one was in California.
0,"It's ok food. A little better than your normal Chinese but that's all. Service was fast. Portions are normal sized for a Chinese. It's pricey, 70 bucks for 3 but it's normal prices for Vegas. Definitely overpriced."
1,"Very nice decoration and food was good too. Try the coconut sake, it's very silky"
1,Still good eats to be had here!!!!
0,"There wasn't much to like about this place except the location is  RIGHT AT the light rail. The music was annoying (live \""bad\"" band), the drinks expensive and sour. I like a margarita served in glass, not plastic. I felt like I should have been poolside or at a sporting event. Didn't try the food and won't be back to see what that's about."
1,"Came here this past Friday for my friend's bachelorette party. We love Tao that's why we wanted to kick off the trip there. Music was great as always. The crowd was awesome, everyone is all from out of town so we're all just trying to have a good time. No lines and open bar and table. It was great! :)"
1,"I was only here for a bit, so I read the reviews and took them in to consideration. A lot of complaints about the location. I happen to love it. Although, I'm also not wearing a shirt as a dress, fk me pumps, and a gucci purse. And I don't like boys with popped collars and sunglasses.. at 11pm. I like being secluded. If you want to be seen then go party by the stadium, hang out on the patio, and bob your head like an idiot. There are girls that like that. It's ambiance that you have to appreciate here. So don't expect to hear \""hey brahh, grab me a jello shooter!\"" If that sounds like something you would like to hear, then really- why even bother? Lots of parking, awesome patio area, super chill, classy (but not booshie), lots of space. \n\nI specifically went in looking for a location for my \""wedding afterparty\"" And it totally fit the bill. Nayo is Doc's daughter and she showed us around. She was so nice and took the unprepared time to talk to us and make us comfortable. We checked out the swing dancing competition that was totally awesome. I wish we had more time to pull up a chair because the jazz band was tearin it up. But we had to catch a movie. \n\nI'm going to give this a 4 star for now simply because I haven't had enough experience to go for the full 5. But we'll be back this week for a drink. I hope this is the place we choose. And I wish my guys were wearing pinstripes and suspenders.. but it's way too late for me to switch up the wedding attire. All in all, I totally loved it. Will be back to review more later..."
1,"All I want to say about this place is.....\n\nThe pizza was finger lickin' good.\nThe Salad was awesome.\nThe House dressing was very, very good.\n\nI want MORE!!!"
1,"I began attending and registered when I moved here in 2010. Overall, this is a good parish, BUT the masses are held at Centennial High School as the church does not have a building and in the process of raising funds. Although this can be frustrating at times, Fr. Bob and Fr. Steve are amazing and the music is nice.\n\nOne of the best things about this parish is the diversity. There are a number of younger families, singles, and middle aged whereas a lot of parishes have a more \""mature\"" population. \n\nThe only negative about the parish is due to being held at CHS, a lot of people do not take mass as serious as they should--ringing cell phones, attire, etc. Other than that, great parish!"
0,"I'm not sure if I'm just NOW figuring out that Laval doesn't have great food but seriously, I've been so disappointed by the food in Laval as of late. Last Saturday a friend and I were trying to think of where to go for a late dinner. Les 3 Brasseurs was a perfect middle meeting point for us so we quickly decided to go there. It was meant to be classic pub style food so you can't really go wrong right?\n\nI arrived first and asked for a table and I was taken to a high perched table in the middle of the room that was just uncomfortable. We had to ask to be moved into one of the MANY booths that were available but NOT cleaned yet. We changed tables, helped the hostess clean our table and she still didn't wipe it down. Strike one.\n\nThe waiter comes around and asks if we are ready to order drinks. We weren't. We said to come back in a few minutes and he took that too literal. His few minutes ended up being about 20 minutes later. So we are now sitting at a semi cleaned table with no food, no drinks, and not even a glass of water.  As we FINALLY get to place our drink orders we ask about what the waiter would recommend and this is where they earned some points back. The waiter was brutally honest. He was like \""I wouldn't eat this...Oh I love this...\"" His suggestions actually made me change my mind about what I wanted to eat.\n\nSo our drinks arrive and then it takes the waiter another 45 minutes to ask for our food orders. The delay is WAY too long and the place isn't busy enough for this to be understandable or tolerable. Once we get our food we only get ONE set of utensils. \n\nI ordered the chicken tender wrap with fries and I was less than impressed. I can understand why it'd take forever to bring the food to the table, I'd be embarassed. \n\nFrench Fries - McCain store bought frozen fries\nChicken Tenders - Store bought frozen tenders\nBBQ Sauce - store bought BBQ sauce.\n\nSo basically all the kitchen staff had to do for this was throw the fries and tenders in the oil, open a package of Tortillas, chop some lettuce and tomatoes throw them on the tortilla and then wait for the chicken to finish frying and roll it all up with some BBQ sauce. I could make better at home...and I should have. \n\nMy friend had a flammekueche which is basically a super flat bread pizza and he said the food was good. I would have tried it but it had peppers and mushrooms on it and those two ingredients revolt me. \n\nAs for the drinks. I think that their beer cocktails were pretty good. I had The Latino and that was pretty awesome. I should have ordered a smaller one since I drink slow and the beer got warm really quick.\n\nThe only reason this is getting a 2 star review is because the waiter at the end of the night redeemed himself by making some jokes. He had me laughing as I was leaving but it wasn't really enough to make me ever go back to Les 3 Brasseurs again."
0,The only positive I can think of is that the rooms are generally very cheap.  You smell a wierd funk when you walk in.  The food choices are slim and bland.  The bars are dated and severely under staffed. Overall a bad place to stay or hang out in a city with so many other options.
1,"I love their hot chocolate, so thick and rich ... their chocolate crepes are yummy too. You may have to wait to get in sometimes. If really busy, the service can be not amazing. The bathroom are not always clean especially if they are more busy. Overall, this place is a chocolate heaven and a very unique experience :)"
1,"I found this nail salon on yelp and decided to check it based on reviews and because it was close to my hotel. I made an appointment for first thing in the morning, since other Yelpers advised it gets busy. Im glad I didn't walk in, busy it did get!  They have an assortment of gel color/glitter samples, and it was hard to choose. Kenny did my gels and was thorough and quick. I think my nails look great and was worth the price I paid. Now lets see how long the gels last."
0,"I am writing this review based on two dining experiences for dinner about three weeks apart.  \n\nI will start off by saying that I am a HUGE fan of Giada and frequently use her recipes and cooking styles in my own every day cooking.  I consider myself to be a great home cook and have been told by many at my dinner table that I am a great cook.  Thank you, Giada (and some other Food Network Stars) for the years of training from the other end of the tv.\n\nEXPERIENCE #1\nThe first was on 10/24/14 and we were there to celebrate my mother's birthday.  We were a table of three.  I made reservations for this dinner months in advance and stated it was my mother's 70th birthday and on the day of I needed to downsize the reservation due to half of our party not arriving to Las Vegas until later due to flight delays.  We arrived 15 minutes early for our reservation and were seated about 10 minutes after our time.  I felt as if we were being punished for changing the number in our party because as we were walked through the restaurant there were MANY (at least 5) four top tables available and we were seated at the table directly next to the entrance/exit to the kitchen.  We spent our entire time hearing the servers and runners yell \""corner\"" as they darted in and out of the kitchen.  One of those yells didn't work out as a collision occurred and plates went flying and crashing to the ground.\n\nOur server was excellent, he was completely educated about the menu and very attentive to our questions and needs.  He checked in with us almost immediately after each course was delivered to our table.  I wish he could be my server every time I dine out!  \n\nThe food was very good with all of the courses devoured.  One issue with the food was it was inconsistent between two orders of the exact same dish, the Lemon Spaghetti.  Two of us ordered it and each tasted different (one had a good amount of sauce and the other had hardly any sauce and flavor on the pasta).\n\nOverall experience for this visit would be four stars.\n\nEXPERIENCE #2\nThe second visit was on 11/16/14.  We were a party of 8 seated at what looked like the only big table in the center of the dining room.  Being seated there was incredible because we could get the full impact of the ambiance of the restaurant.\n\nWe were greeted promptly by our server and food service assistant (not sure about the title).  Shortly after, we ordered drinks and then ordered our food a short while after that.  Bread was brought (which by the way is AMAZING) and we were enjoying our experience.\n\nOur food was brought out in courses.  The appetizer course was fantastic.  Next came the pasta and main courses, all brought at the same time.  The sides were brought out about 5 minutes later except my side which was brought out another 5 minutes after that.  Of the pasta and main course dishes, 5 out the 8 were great (especially the risotto which was ordered by two of our group).  Unfortunately, three of the dishes were not good.  We had to send back the lamb because the meat was spongy and two of our group ordered the Bucatini pasta (one of the two vegetarian options that are not a side dish or pizza) and it was completely flavorless.  After one guest sent back the lamb, the server was no where to be found and never checked in on the rest of our meals until 30 minutes later when plates were being cleared.  The two that had the Bucatini talked to the server and sent back their pasta.  The server asked if there was something else that he could prepare and my friend, a vegetarian, asked what was on the menu (other than the Rigatoni with mushrooms which he is allergic to) that he could have.  The server made a very snarky comment...\""I already reviewed the whole menu with you\"".\n\nThe manager never came over to talk to us about the problems with our meal.  The food service assistant never brought the additional bread that we asked for and when we asked again, his response...\""oh, sorry\"" and nothing further.\n\nI have to say that for a restaurant that categorizes themselves as fine dining and for the VERY EXPENSIVE price points, this type of service and the lack of caring that three of the five entree/pasta dishes had to be sent back is completely unacceptable.  When I shared my experience with my friends who are locals in LV, they told me that the buzz around town with the locals is that the restaurant is just average at best.\n\nOverall experience for the second visit would be 1/2 of a star, which is being generous.\n\nI am truly unsure if I will ever return to Giada's restaurant on one of my many trips to Vegas."
1,"This is my new place for sushi in the Valley.  Went for lunch on Tuesday and the place was busy but service was very prompt.  We ordered 3 different sushi rolls and a salad.  The portions were so large we took plenty home.  The ingredients were fresh and very flavorful.  Had the eel, spicy crab, and Mexican caliente rolls and all of them were absolutely DELISH!!!  If you're a sushi lover, you will not be disappointed!"
0,"I haven't eaten at this restaurant, but I can rate their poor service and their lack of integrity.  I purchased their Groupon for the 7-course taster menu.  Perhaps they sold too many of these because they have had no availability for people to come in and redeem their Groupons.  \n\nI called 4 times over the course of 3 months with numerous dates and times that I was available to come in, and each time they had no availability.  On the last call, after informing me that there was still no availability, the manager informed me that the deal would expire at the end of the month and that there was only one time slot left on a weeknight that I could take to redeem the Groupon.    \n\nHe was rude and made no apologies, and no concessions when I protested that it was unfair to no longer accept the Groupon deal.  I found his manner of addressing me completely offensive.  \n\nI accepted the last available slot, and I am going to eat there since I have already paid for the meal.  Hopefully their busy schedule is evidence that their food is at least worth it, but I doubt it will be worth the trouble it has taken to get inside the door.  At the very least, I heartily discourage purchasing any Groupon that they post in the future."
1,"I work in Oakland, so this is my home away from home in the morning! I love this particular Crazy Mocha for so many reasons: the location, the morning barista, and let's not forget the coffee and tea! I also love that they have partnered with LoyalTree, a rewards program for those with smartphones. The only drink I've had that I didn't like was the chai latte. It tasted like how a spiced candle smells! Other than that, every latte I've had has been excellent! With very little seating, this location can get a little crazy in the afternoon, but it's always quiet and cozy in the morning."
0,"Went here late the other night to get a bite to eat...I thought this place was open 24hours...I was wrong, got kicked out at 3am...not quite kicked out but the manager kept hinting that we would have to go soon.\n\nWould not suggest eating here...the service was OK, except the waitress got my order wrong. In general the restaurant was clean.\n\nI got the turkey club sandwich...it was quite stale, and did not taste very good, the seasoned fries were OK my date for the evening got a salad...what else is new right...anyhow she ate it all so it must have been OK.\n\nI have experienced better not very impressed with this location."
0,"I bet the food is great. It's too bad we didn't get to that point. My friend an I arrived a few minutes before meeting our other friend so we sat at the bar because we were kinda in a hurry. We saved her a seat and expected her any minute. Now, as far as I've ever been told about dining customs, is that the bar, whether it be one that actually serves booze or what, is open seating and can't be reserved and the host can't make you give it up. Two other girls walked in and wanted a booth but the host told them to sit at the bar instead. We told the girls we were saving this one seat for our friend and the host came over and rudely said, \""YOU ARE NOT SAVING THIS SEAT!\"" As our friend walks in. The other girls were like hey, it's all good, we wanted a booth anyways and he MADE US sit here. Rude as FFFFFFFFF. We were confused. But hey, Jobot is just a block away and I suggest you try their chorizo biscuits and gravy because it's AMAZING."
1,"Can't really say anything about the place that hasn't already been said--great service, cool, relaxed atmosphere, best bar food I've ever had, killer fries, Kiltlifter's great, 8th Street Ale's pretty good, blah, blah, blah. . . it's all true.\n\nActually I take that back--try the stuffed chicken if it's on the menu. (it's a special) It's effing awesome.  This place truly does have the best bar food. Anywhere."
0,"Short one night trip to Vegas the day after Thanksgiving and was welcomed by a sea of Asian fobs (who apparently don't believe in Thanksgiving). After giving up on Bacchanal (3 HOUR WAIT!!!!), we ventured to Ichiza. \n\nPut my name down for a party of 6 and was told that it would be over an hour. Decide to just tough it out...10 minutes later, my friend goes in to check on our position and is told that the wait is now 30 minutes. ???\nAfter waiting for about 40 minutes, the owner comes out and asks us if we can finish dining within an hour. We oblige, mainly just to grab a seat.\n\nOnce seated, we promptly order everything we can think of, in hopes of finishing within the agreed upon time. \n\nWasabi octopus.....\""Sorry, we are run all out.\""\nOkra natto....\""Are you sure you want? It has natto in it.\"" (Me: \""Yes, I understand this\"")\nAnkimo....\""I am sorry. No more.\""\nUni in ponzu sauce....\""I'm sorry, we are all out tonight.\""\n\nAfter scrapping together an order, we wait once again. 15 minutes pass before the first dishes come out. Some were decent, most were par for the course. Nearing our one hour limit, we are waiting for our bowls of ramen. We inquire and are told, \""we are out of miso broth, only shoyu ramen left. Do you still want?\""\n\nMe: \""Yes.\""\nWould have been nice to be asked this a little earlier.\n\nAnother 10 minutes....and they bring 1 out of 3 ramens ordered. \n\nWe finish. \nPromptly given the bill by the owner.\n\nAverage yakitori. Below average service."
1,"Ah T.C. Eggington's...I wish your brunch lines weren't such a feat of strength. If you're going on the weekend, be prepared to wait. \n\nThis is a cute spot in a nondescript shopping center that is home to a Boot Barn and a few of your typical commercial center shops. You'll know where T.C. is by the line of people anxiously waiting to get their bacon and egg on in various stages of \""ohmygodhowlonghavewebeenwaiting.\""\n\nThe menu is a fun mix of omelettes, egg creations, pancakes, waffles and lunch. Honestly, I've only glanced once at the lunch menu because I mean well..it's an egg place. I came for the eggs.\n\nThey have really good housemade jams that are on the table and ready to be slathered on their homemade english muffins which will put those store bought kind to shame. They come slightly buttered and are just a little crisp around the edges. They're very light and not spongey like the ones that come in a plastic bag at the market.\n\nMy favorite omelette is the o'pear grenache a mixture of pears, sliced almonds and Havarti. I know, who puts pears in an omelette? But it's one of those weirdly delicious flavor combinations that you would never put together yourself. \n\nThe beverages are solid-I've enjoyed every cup of coffee and juice that I've had here and they now offer adult beverages which is a rich reward for what is often a long wait.\n\nThe service is friendly and attentive, even during the busiest hours and the wait staff wears old timey button down and khaki numbers that really just have to be seen to be believed (and understood). I think crazy socks are part of the uniform too because I've never seen an average pair in the times that I've dined there and believe me, I've looked.\n\nDespite the wait this is a consistently good brunch option that I will continue to wait for!"
1,"I have been here a few times for oil changes and have always been satisfied. This time Pete the manager really exceeded my expectations! I bought 2 tires and they hooked me up with an oil change, they beat Big O's quote for just tires by $200! For the same tire!!!  I highly recommend this Tire Pro's location!"
1,"There was a line out the door, and upon watching the other patrons waiting for a table holding their BYO wares,  I dispatched myself to get a bottle of beer for the appetizers and a bottle of wine for the mains.  Fortunately there was a place nearby.\n\nThe food did not disappoint.  It was certainly home made and turned out to be great.  I was short on imagination so we did not stray from the typical order of Dolmas, Artichokes, Calimari for starters and then Lamb for mains.  My friends got the Shisk-Kabob which they swear were the best they have had.\n\nIf you are in Montreal please go, it will not dissapoint."
1,"Heard raves from friends\nchecked it out 2pm ish with bf & bro\nOrdered 3 different ramens:\nPork Tonkatsu, Beef Miso, Beef Spicy \n\nVery helpful, friendly counter guy\nNice chill soothing decor\nVery yummy ramen with perfect doness/chewiness\nBig bowl with lots of ramen but\nI could definitely eat a bit more meat for $7+ bucks\nEspecially for all the growing/starving ASU kids nearby\n(Tempe is not Japan where cost of living is higher\n and if they wanna thrive in a college area)\n\nMy fav was the tonkatsu soup base.\nNot open Sundays, not sure why not..\nCould see this as a late nite after bar hangout/eatery\nIf it stays open later like 11pm/midnite\nYeah Im a night owl\n\nWe all liked Republic Ramen and will be back!"
0,"They would not honor their advertised special offer! \n\nThe appetizer combination, especially the bruschetta was excellent.  \n\nThe veal dish was too salty. The pizza was served about 10 minutes after the veal. (not what good restaurants do)  It was good, but average wood fired type pizza.   \n\nFriendly staff"
1,Been here off and on but never for this long. I've been working here today for 5 hours so far because I was nearby when they opened. I had a drip coffee and loved it. So tasty and made cup by cup. Then a black mango tea that was the perfect aroma and need nothing. Later in the morning a friend came in and purchased a cappuccino. OMG it was the prettiest thing I've seen so I had to buy one. I have NEVER had a better one in my life. I am serious. Come here. Drink here. I love their iPad cash register & art. Late Sunday mornings the wifi gets a little clogged from the number of people but it's a cool joint. \n\nPS. I know Jeff M. had issues with their customer service but the two ladies working today rock.
0,"DO NOT. I repeat. DO NOT take your vehicle to this sun devil auto. Horrible atmosphere all they want are your keys to your car and the money afterwards for the pathetic job of \""mechanic work\"" save your time, money and patience and take it else where"

1,Super great deli with tasty sandwiches and soups. The Blazing Buffalo is my favorite.
1,"I like this place. I went with a group social group to this place. The atmosphere is great, [for a non-restauarant] and the food is good.. They have a decent selection of beer. The service wasn't horrible. Although, it looked like they were a bit stretched for serving a large group. \n\nIf you're on a date, you should go here. The insulation of \""upper class\""ness [being a wine place] is nice, dim lighting, and the atmosphere is cozy. \n\nCONS: They have 2 TVs in this place. If I'm in a place for socializing I rather not have TVs on."
0,"Thank you for deleting my review because it shines the light on how terrible this hospital is, Luckily - I have it saved so I can paste it as many times as I'd like, and have shared with everyone I know to avoid this horrific establishment: \n\n\nAbsolute Garbage. Worst hospital I've ever witnessed in action.\n\nMy father fell and fractured his hip.\n\nDay 1:\nthey withold my father from eating as they say hes going to have surgery that day\nwe keep asking, nurses have no idea when he's having surgery\nlunch rolls around, dinner rolls around, still no food and still no surgery (He has low blood sugar, diabetes, and is 74)\nat night they say they realize it wouldn't be able to happen that day, tell him and ask if he wants dinner (which took another hour to be delivered to him).\nMy mom took off work, which cut into her schedule and really screwed us over.\n\nDay 2: surgery scheduled for 3 pm.\nmom gets off work early, we get here at 2 and wait. (Granted I have school, she took off more time for work, and my dad's going without food again)\n\n3 doctor rolls on in, states some genius had a hole in their glove and contaminated all the work equipment which would take an hour to fix. 4 pm rolls around. 5 pm rolls around. 6 pm rolls around. We ask every hour what in hell is going on, still receive no information - at 6, we finally learn that an emergency case came in and they used the room which they had prepped for my dad, and said it would be another 20 minutes.\n6:30 rolls around. they come in tell us another 20 minutes.\n7:15 rolls around. my dad is raging, and we're trying to calm him down but he hasn't eaten all day and is in a lot of pain - I don't blame him for being pissed at this horrendous system they call a hospital.\n7:30 rolls around and they finally get him in, but I forgot to mention the nurses who all gathered his information all went home (boy lucky them) so we got some potato head genius's who roll in asking all the same questions, which just makes this situation feel even more smooth.\nAll in all, this is the biggest joke of a hospital experience I've witnessed.\nIf I was there for the first day, I would have had him transferred to another hospital.\nSurprised my mother didn't. If I was there the first day, I would have probably exploded at the staff about how incompetent they were.\n\nwould not recommend anyone with a sick or injured family member to come here. we came here because it was closer, but next time will definitely tell ambulance or whoever to take the injured person out of their way to banner baywood or banner desert.\n\nPROS:\n- friendly nurse staff\n-clean environment\n-good hospital food\n\nCONS:\n-terrible communcation skills (Between staff and staff-to-patient)\n-horrible bedside manner in shift transition (potato heads waltz in asking redudant questions with a cheeky smile on their face when we've waitied for days and are irate beyond belief. how about some communication if you don't feel like getting yelled at).\n-awful time management and design scheme, how about we make patients wait for days when they have conditions that could put their life in danger if they don't eat.\n\nI would give this place a 0 for their service, and a negative score for trying to hide my review. Disgusting."
1,"My favorite place in Phoenix to grab a Perfect Pint. I think Guinness in an Irish pub just tastes better. And at Rosie's its even better thanks to the lively pub. My friends and I go come here whenever possible, its always a great time with great friends, great drink, and at a great place. Rosie's is that place where you always bump into someone you know. It makes this city seem just a little bit smaller. If you get there early enough for dinner, try the fish and chips, it's pretty tasty. But really, Guinness is a meal unto itself. Just grab a booth, sit back, and enjoy the night."
0,"It was my sister's bachelorette party and I bought us all tickets to go to this Prince Tribute show. The show was good. It brought back alot of memories for me and my sisters and the music was a blast. \n\nThe only messed up thing about this show was the back up dancer. SHE WILL HATE YOU IF YOU ARE PRETTIER THAN HER! I'm not trying to talk crap, just the truth. My little sister is gorgeous. Once the show was over, the dancer immediately starting talking ish to my little sister saying how my sister was hating on her when my little sister was dancing and cheering her on the whole time when she was on stage! She totally killed the mood. Even the \""Prince\"" person said that my sister was pretty and boy oh boy, the dancer did not like that!\nShe pretty much ruined what was supposed to be a good time! So thanks biotch!\n\nSo the actual \""show\"" was good. The performance was good, but the cast (the dancer and prince)were all stuck up!\n\nMorris Day and the other guys were very good though, so kudos to them!"
1,It smells nice.\n\nIt's inexpensive.\n\nIt makes a sly dig at the recipient's personal hygiene.\n\nAnd this is yet another place where you can pick up gifts for any menopausal women who make it onto your Xmas gift-buying list.

0,"We tried Florencia because of a Groupon that I purchased - 50% off. The place was empty when we went on a Saturday afternoon for lunch. We ordered a garden salad to share amongst our table and a specialty pizza.  Overall, I was underwhelmed. They advertise that they sell the dressing for their salad but I found it to be a bit watery.  As for the pizza, parts of the crust were burnt and overall the flavor left something to be desired.  We ordered the Pomodoro, which was listed in the menu as coming with eggplant.  When the pizza arrived I discovered that the eggplant was fried, which I would have liked to know. Since other patrons have raved about the pizza I would give it another chance, but n based on this trip alone I wouldn't give a strong recommendation."
1,"Great little park. I run or walk around the small path, a few times a week. There's a small playground for kids, tennis courts, basketball, two baseball fields. There's and a small workout section. Most days it's pretty quiet unless the little league has set up shop (usually Wednesday around 5pm or 6pm)\n\nOn most weekends you'll find families staking out the lone grill. But if you can keep a secret there's actually a small grill off to the side near a singular table. \nTonight there was a kid practicing the clarinet. I'm not sure how good he was, as I had my Pandora turned up."
1,"This is the 86th review of this restaurant so it's hard to make too many fresh comments, but I'll at least put my score into here for statistical purposes.  I cruised through the NoDa area and when I saw Cabo I recalled the decent Yelp! reviews so I figured I'd give it a try.  I went on a Monday night so it wasn't too busy (the rest of NoDa was a ghost town) and the service was prompt and friendly.  I ordered the jalapeno & cheese 'mashers' which I presupposed meant mashed potatoes.  Unfortunately, I was giving the beans and rice, kind of a downer as my GF ordered the beans and rice and we wouldn't get to see what both sides were like.  In the server's defense, she did ask a moment after bringing it out if everything came out right.  I enjoyed everything else enough to just overlook the error.  The chips and salsa were good and, as this was my first time here, came as a bit of a pleasant surprise.  Price-wise I think it was about what I expected $22 for two meals w/ water and tax+tip.  If it was half that price I'd be here everyday perhaps.  One more note, they let me switch the cilantro (yuck) white sauce for honey wasabi (yummy) sauce without a problem."
0,"I'd recommend a road trip to Lexington instead.\n\nThe chopped BBQ was decent. Not as dry as what I've had from Mac's Speed Shop but the smokiness reminds me of the Dickey's Barbecue Pit chain. I suspect liquid smoke is used here.\n\nAlso, judging from people's photos on Yelp and my own experience Sauceman's cannot consistently make BBQ slaw the right way. Mine was like chopped cabbage drowning in Kansas City BBQ sauce.\n\nOn the plus side, their banana pudding is good."
1,"They did a WONDERFUL job caring for my pups while I made a quick trip back to NashVegas...  Brittany taught Toffee how to fetch AND to bring the ball back!  She created a monster...  but, I'm good with it.  Prices are reasonable for the service they provide.  And, they are so kind and friendly!!!!  I HIGHLY recommend them."
0,"Nourish used to be one of my favorite places since I'm gluten free. However they recently changed their menu and it isn't nearly as good as doesn't have close to as many options. The service is so poor on Saturday that it took forever to get our food, our table wasn't wiped from the party before and we'd asked them to numerous times to take care of it and my food wasn't prepared as ordered. Its so sad that such a great gem was reduced to this."
0,"Worst experience with a hairdresser ever, at this location. Made an appointment with Diane for a body wave. When I was sort of greeted by her she looked at my hair and said \""You get body waves?\"" Yeah, that's why I booked one at your salon. Then she argued with me about when to trim, I wanted after she wanted before, and after five minutes acknowledged that it didn't matter, but FIRST telling me the perm \""wouldn't soak in\"" on the ends unless she trimmed it. Then she argued with me about the rods. It's taken me over ten years to figure out with Aveda perm hairstylists what the perfect combo is. Diane knew better, but finally agreed. Then she proceeded to comb my wet hair, from the forehead back, scratching my scalp and jerking my head. That wasn't enough, though. She then started rolling it with the rods she thought I should have.  I got up and left. When I addressed the problem at the front, NO EFFORT WAS MADE TO HELP me other than to offer coming back and talking to the owner. Yeah. Right. THAT'S gonna happen. Horrible salon...dirty, also, just as a side note."
0,"The manager lady with tattoos all around her neck does not need to be in customer service field. Like talking to a brick wall. \n\nCashiers Do Not ask how your doing, if you have MyLowes card or anything. Everyone is a blank stare. \n\nI was told by an employee to order what I was looking for online, when I looked it up online there were 9 in this store. They just simply don't want to do anything at this store. \n\nBob Niblock needs to drive from Mooresville and lay down the law at this store."
1,"Perfect date night location, makes you feel like you're in New York City! Absolutely love this spot. Try the fondu appetizer with pear and pork 'butt'... so delish. The drinks are all amazing, but my favorite concoction has been the Fortified Fig -- Gin, whipped up with something yummy including egg and cinnamon. I can't wait to swing by and check out their lunch menu."
1,"Good crab legs.all you can eat on Monday,with a free glass of wine if you stay at hooters.mashed potatoes and salad was also on point."
0,"I've been to Max's about 10 times, 8 of them being before they even opened up. It's located in the old Lone Star Steakhouse standing alone between an Albertson's and Chevron. You can't miss it.\n\nThe interior is very nice, certainly nicer than any Filipino restaurant I've been too. It's fancy like Vegas but not so cause there's no go go dancers. There's lots of seating and a bar.\n\nI did some research before coming and noticed Max's is known for their fried chicken and halo halo. I had the whole fried chicken dinner with two sides, some slaw and fries. The chicken was kind of disappointing. It wasn't meaty, juicy, or crispy. It was tiny for the price but had some good flavors, potential to being good. The slaw and fries were basic nothing special. I'll try the chicken again just cause it's what they're banking on plus it was their 1st day.\n\nThe halo halo was good then again can you really screws up halo halo. For those who haven't had halo halo it's a cold dessert made up of shaved ice, evaporated milk, various beans, fruits, and fruit preserves. Sometimes there's ube ice cream which Max's does.\n\nThey serve other Filipino food at pretty reasonable prices. The customer service is very friendly. Let them make their \""special sauce\"" they get a kick of making it for you. I think it was nothing but banana ketchup, Worcestershire sauce, and something else, it was alright. I'd probably come back."
0,"Yellowtail was a big disappointment.\nThe only thing to rave about was the Ahi Tuna Pizza.\nEverything else, was blah . . . .  nothing outstanding, nothing memorable.\nService was terrible, even though the restaurant was more than half empty.\nWent there for a after show bite - 10:30pm so the restaurant wasn't crowded.\nHad to repeatedly ask for water and hot tea to be refilled and got the impression that the server was too bored to be serving.\nLater, back in the hotel room, saw on BellagioTV that the chef Akira Back was a prior professional snowboarder and got into being a chef to \""feed himself\"" since pro snowboarders didn't make much money!\nWell, it shows. \nThe old restaurant Shintaro was way much better!  Should have kept Shintaro and ditch Yellowtail!  Bring back the jellyfish!"
1,i died and went to heave. it was an expensive trip!
1,"This place would be a hole in the wall if it wasn't for triple d advertising to the world. Love the emerald chicken and Chinese BBQ pork plus I prefer double pork or chicken fried rice.  You can get any meat in a burrito or as a quesadilla, this is awesome.  Never miss a chance to come here. Great food."
0,"Walked up to bar. order beer. fanned my money a five and 4-ones. bartender brings 2 bottles and scoops up all the money. I asked how much they were. she told me 2 for $4. uh... give me back my money..  she got all hurt that she didn't wasn't able to TAKE my money.  Also ordered a FIREBALL. poured me a cheap knock off.  Charged me and when i pointed out it wasn't Fireball, she argued with me, took ALL my change from a $20 and walked out to find a manager. He came in and argued with me, then admitted it was a different product.  Didn't offer to refund my money or make me another drink. I HAD TO ASK for a Washington Apple. Bartender didn't know how to make it.  Poured a lot of Crown, Pucker, and Cranberry in a shaker then filled a shot glass with about a third of what was in the shaker.  \n\nI won't go back!"
1,"If you're looking for something super greasy, the brunch here is for you. Located on the Capitol square in Madison, Dlux is situated in a great location. My friends and I came here for their highly reputed \""bottomless mimosa\"" brunch on a Saturday morning, and there were some nice parts of the experience and some less nice parts. \n\nI'll start with the letdowns. Coming here on a Saturday morning, I expected the atmosphere to be calm and relaxing. It felt like a club, with the latest pop/electronic hits playing in the background. Also, someone had recommended the parmesan cream truffle fries, but they did not live up to my expectations. Over a span of 15-20 minutes, the cream sauce on the fries congealed in a non-appetizing fashion. \n\nOther than those two things though, I enjoyed Dlux. The donut balls are great. The strawberry cream sauce that accompanied them was super tasty and complemented the indulgent fried dough balls. I got the spicy sausage breakfast sandwich, and the sriracha mayo sauce made the sandwich incredible. I would also recommend getting the sweet potato fries with the aforementioned sriracha mayo dip. I'm a little biased because I love sweet potato fries, but they're worth it.\n\nThe espresso milkshake was also great. Espresso grinds mixed in with ice cream. Simple and delicious. I didn't have the bottomless mimosas, but they're exactly what I expected: a little diluted but decent.\n\nOverall, Dlux was a great place to dine with reasonable prices. Make sure to come before the brunch rush though."
1,"This really deserves a 3.5/5 stars. The room was the largest I have stayed in, with a separate suite, but the view was poor and it was loud due to the roller coaster. The casino itself is great. Would recommend this to friends."
0,"I usually like shopping at Michaels but I just don't like this store.  I don't like walking through the cramped doorway for starters. The customer service level also needs some upgrading.  Luckily I could find the supplies I needed without needing any help.  I've been in this store several times and the staff have never been all that helpful or friendly. This store is only down the street from Hobby Lobby where you can find some of the same items and then Jo-ann's really isn't that far away either, so you would think they'd be more responsive to their customers.  This store could use a makeover and it needs to provide its employees with some customer service training."
0,"Ok, you walk in and the feeling is well, oh man, not this.  \""House\"" music bumpin', I felt like I was in a scene from Showgirls - and not a sex scene.  I think Nomi Malone would throw a hissy fit and throw fries all over the pretentious jerks who strut around at \""Tao\"".  The 30 foot tall Buddha is striking - and stupid.  I had tuna nigiri (which was really good) chicken something on a stick, some sort of fried affair and a whole bunch of other fusion food.  The food was ok but it made me crave real food, that's something about Vegas I noticed.  Yeah, they make a good mojito with a cute little sugar cane stick up in it, it was sweet, it made feel good, just like the feeling I had when I got out of there."
0,Like the atmosphere With the remodel. Went to see a band on a Friday night very good music.. REALLY REALLY HORRIBLE service inside at the bar two girls that did not have a clue behind the bar.. Very rude and slow 20 minutes for a drink is absurd. Then when u ask nicely they give u an attitude like its not there problem
0,Whoever manages the place just doesn't seem to care. Lots of things broken or missing.The obviously 25 year old air conditioner was slow but at least it worked. If you have a choice stay somewhere else!
1,Great Instruction and class. First time here and they made me feel very welcome. I really liked the class and will definetly be back for more.
0,"This place is disgusting. \n\nI dont think they even speak English there, I asked for a Coke and got a Dr Pepper. And asked if it was Coke and he just smiled at me...?\n\nPoor selection."
1,"On a Tuesday night, we ordered the salt and pepper pork, chicken curry over rice, rotti pancake, and almond pudding for 15.90.\n\n- NO WONG!? FYI, it means good business or being prosperous. \""big wong\"" is actually MISTA LEE. lol. good people :)\n- Smells like raw eggs upon entering. goes away tho. you adapt the asian smell.\n- No bone! easy eats for shovelers. pork chop cut in small pieces. \n- Chicken curry was great. comes with chopped potatoes. Not golden curry brand. where the carrots at tho?\n- pancake tasted like a crepe! crispy! sweet! delicious! must get! 1.25! the price of a gum. BIG JUICE! probably less!\n- Almond pudding was also a hit. 3 lychees tho. not bad.\n- service is a bit slow. waterless for awhile. i get thirsty -___-. where my pork chop?\n- Ms Lee takes pictures!\n- So cheap! AYCE got nothin on this"
1,"We recently stopped into this cool antique shop while in Vegas. As we entered the first thing we noticed was the loud music playing throughout the shop. I felt like i was in a night club yet I was shopping for antiques. We actually liked it and have no complaints. The owners were friendly and yet hands off which we like. \n\nThe shop was filled with an interesting eclectic variety of art and antiques. Some vintage retro pieces, old paintings, gambling memorabilia, pop art, art glass, furniture and smalls etc. The back room was rather large and there appeared to be room for even more merchandise. \n\nIn the front store window was a unqiue former dumpster that had been converted into an upholstered industrial modern two person loveseat. That's a first. Behind it was the rear end of a 57 chevy coverted into a sofa. Cool stuff.\n\nTucked way in the back of the shop we found a secluded Tiki room filled with everything Tiki. It was decked out in everything tiki and rather extensive.\n\nWe liked the vibe of this shop."
1,"Went for dinner, make reservations!  We shared the popular crispy rice appetizer.  So many flavors, mint, ginger, garlic, spices, peanuts, I'm sure I'm missing some.  Be sure to order one.  \nI got the cod, I believe it was black cod, steamed on top of steamed cabbage with a spicy pepper sauce on the side.  This was a pretty healthy dish, fish on cabbage I skipped the rice.  He got the duck in a panang curry.  These were huge pieces of duck, easily split this entree.  The duck was seasoned well and crispy from pan frying.  The curry was very good, and medium was a good level of pepper.  They were out of the mango with sticky rice, so we split the coconut ice cream.  The ice cream tasted homemade, chunks of coconut in it.\nAn awesome restaurant!"
1,"The wings here are excellent.  The \""suicide\"" heat level is not ridiculously hot, but very tasty and they aren't over-powered by vinegar as too many other places do.  My wife loves the white pizza with garlic.  They are generous on the cheese and the thin crust is very tasty and well done.  Service is always good."
0,"I gave them 2 stars because they really fell off my expectations. I have been here many time, dined in almost all the restaurants and I have good experience, but staying here is a total different story. \n\nMy first night has no heat. I called front desk and they sent an \""engineer\"" to fix it and it took him almost an hour. He said he fixed it but after he left I found out there was still no heat. I called front desk again and they wants to send another engineer. It was 4:30am! They offered me to remove my resort fee but it appeared on my final bill and I have to talk them through. \n\nNot to mention the hotel rooms are old. You are better off to stay at Venetian."
0,"Those jerks left a old part floating in my gas tank. \n\nIt caused problem with my gas gauge and I ran out of gas and had to walk for 2 hours in the middle of night against 30 MPH wind. \n\nHere is the story: \n\nMy \""check engine\"" light was on, so I took my 2002 Camry to this place. \n\nOne hour later, they call me and told me some valve in the gas tank needed to be replaced. It's $500. If I decide not to fix it, it's $110 for checking the car. And they recommended a lot of other \""repairs\"" I might want to do. All together would be $1500. \n\nWhat is this?? Somebody call the police. I am being robbed. \n\nI told them to just take care of the \""check engine\"" light problem first. \n\nI picked up my car within one hour. And it's $500 for one hour of work. I started reading the bill, they charged me a new gas cap for $55 and that's before the labor cost. \n\nThat's when I swore to myself never again coming to dealership to repair anything. \n\nOne year later, I took the car to the repair sho to fix the gauge after the 2 hours walk home. They told me some body left behind a piece of old part broke off from a valve floating in the gas tank. \n\nUnbelievable!!!"
1,"I can easily spend a weeks salary here! Great quality clothing and unique finds for all men, women, and kids! Love this place."
1,They had a good selection of items going around.  We only paid 30 bucks for two of us and that is really good for sushi.   We will be back for sure.
1,I've been here twice for brunch and it's great! My carnivorous son got the steak and eggs and it looked pretty high quality. My girl likes the Chilaquiles and I've enjoyed the vegetarian omelet and I totally vouch for the Huevos Rancheros.\n\nI'm excited to head there for lunch or dinner to try the margaritas and something that's not on the brunch menu.
0,"I received lip injections from Dr. Caniglia. I was skeptical because when I called the receptionist informed me he did not have before and after pictures of his patients for this particular procedure. I went against my better judgement since Dr. Caniglia specializes in facial plastic surgery.\n\nDr. Caniglia rushed through the procedure and did not shape my lips. I was left with asymmetry from too much filler in one side of my lip. This is a direct result of the skill and experience of the injector. \n\nI was told I would need to pay for another syringe for him to \""correct\"" the results. Dr. Caniglia's techniques seem dated and I will need to have another surgeon correct the bad injections.\n\nLesson learned I will not go to a plastic surgeon who does not have before and after pictures available for the specific procedure I want."
1,"I loved the service here almost as much as the food, they were very polite and friendly. They did forget one item the second time we went, but they brought it out quickly enough and everything tastes so good that it's hard to think about complaining over something like that. It's a bit pricy but worth it if you are in the mood for a dim lit comfortable dinner out"
1,Thit Heo Nuong is Amazing! Great Happy Hour!
1,"New looks, they are making things at Michaels a little bit posh, with new isles, configurations and groupings, I had to stroll around just to familiarize myself with the new surroundings. \n\nOf course the same great crafting materials for just about any project is available, however, I have been looking for two sided crochet hooks, size K and they don't have it! I bought a book for such a project from them, but then when I went back to buy the hooks, no such luck. \n\nThe other craft stores in my area have something like I'm looking for, but do not carry the size K I need! I guess I'll have order on line! Why sell a book for projects but do not carry the supplies is a little bit disappointing, however, this is my first and only quandary with this craft store, so unless I stumble onto something else, they will remain on the top of my list!"
1,"I absolutely adore this little shop. I have been in there 3 times and every time I've walked out with a better deal then the time before. I'm so proud of my finds. I haven't been in to consign anything yet, but I'm building up the courage to do so. I'm a bit intimidated by the process, not sure why I'm sure it's a lot of fun. Way to go Poor Little Rich Girl! \""Now lets go shopping\"" ; )"
0,"These guys were a no call no show.  I rearranged my work schedule to accommodate the appointment that we agreed upon, and they never showed nor even called. Very unprofessional.\n\nI would not recommend unless you like wasting your time!"
0,"While the food was good, the service was AWFUL.  The restaurant was well-staffed and not overly busy, so we could not figure out why our waitress was so slow.  We politely voiced our disappointment with the manager, and she was very apologetic, going to far as to buy us a round of drinks, although we told her that was not necessary.  One would think that after lodging a complaint that the service would have improved, but no such luck.  Based on our experience, it would seem that the owners went well out of their way to hire the most inefficient, apathetic, unpleasant people they could find.  While this place has potential, without a major personnel change, I predict that they will be hurting for business before long.  We will not be returning."
0,i was there for the first time a few weeks ago.  Dropped off both of my kids and when I picked them up a few hours later the boys said that they were hit the whole way home.  Also brought stuff to change diapers and they did not do that and sat in dirty diapers for hours.  I filed a complaint and there offer was to come back and get a tour.  NO THANKS!! never going back.  DO NOT TAKE YOUR KIDS HERE!!
0,"This place can be alright if you stick with selected dishes. Rice dishes are safe. I think I got the pork chops and egg op la. Its not on the menu.\n\nI did not try the pho, but stay away. Hu tieu dishes, stay away.\n\nI ordered the hu tieu special and I can see how they made the broth from my soup. Some bones, yeah thats okay. I think cow tongue? i guess its acceptable but no."
0,"JERSEY SHORE meets THE KARDASHIANS...\nI went in with high expectations, and left the shop after my cut and decided i will never go back. I got a hangover massage and a cut that day. While getting my massage, the barber was more interested in yelling across the studio to talk to the girl working the front desk and her boyfriend who unexpectedly stopped in than paying attention to me and what she was doing. \nShe cut my hair an inch and a half shy of what i requested, and the most ANNOYING part was the fact that they turn all the chairs to the center of the room so they can talk to each other. I didn't see the mirror until the end of the visit, only to realize what a disappointing cut i received. They were so into letting the customers know what their social life was all about. I don't care that you're going to a rave, and i don't care that you plan on wearing a bikini top to it. (i thought raves ended in 2003)\nThey think they're cool and hip, but they're not. They may want to relocate back to Verona or deeper into the burbs.\nI will be going to Ryan Graham's Barber Shop a few blocks down the street from now on."
1,"I love their osaka ribs!\nTheir other food is pretty good too.\nThey have teppanyaki tables.\nService is good.\nThey cover their tables with a tablecloth & butcher paper over the tablecloth. (I think it's a waste of paper. I wish they wouldn't do that).\nThe lighting is a little too dim for my taste. I know some people think it's romantic or whatever, but I personally like to be able to read my menu.\nThe fresh flowers on the tables are a nice touch.\nI like their trendy decor."
1,"Taco Tuesday ~ enough said!!\nNice people working at this location, good food & always fresh! A line is always present in the drive thru and you never you know who you'll run into inside the restaurant.\nClean place to have a bite OR go for take out! Its nice always being thanked for your business!"
1,I like Serranos but sometimes their food seems a little too pre-made for my tastes. They have good salsa and bean dip and a good selection on the menu. Their veggie enchiladas are good as well as the spinach enchiladas. I like that they have fresh homemade tortillas. They aren't the best tortillas I've had but kudos that they don't use the waxy pre-packaged junk that a lot of places use.
0,"Have been to this place two times now and I probably will not go back. Drinks are expensive and seem to be lacking- you don't get the alcohol you pay for!\nWent in tonight to try their food and catch up with a friend. Did not get any service for the first 10-15 min.  The server was nice, but seemed one fry short of a happy meal.\nWe both ordered the holy cow- which came out cold and both plates looked different. The meat was cut different than my friends and she had more slices. Not only that, the meat was ice cold! \nI could go on- but don't want to. I won't eat there again!"
1,"We have eaten here twice, once for a wedding and the second time was just the two of us on our next trip. The steak is ultimately what brought us back for the second time; it is the best steak I have ever had and they managed to get it perfect twice.\nThe atmosphere is fantastic, very comfortable but still elegant. We had dinner reservations and were seated as soon as we arrived. We sat in the dining room where the bar is also located. I love that they do not have tables stacked on top of each other, the space in between made it feel like we were the only people in there. \nPlease keep in mind that this is a 5 star restaurant...\n...It is pretty expensive, especially when you start adding on for drinks and an appetizer.\n...this restaurant is not only about the food, it is a dining experience. They want you to sit, relax and enjoy everything. Some of the reviewers were upset because they waited 30 minutes for their food. Seriously! Slow down and enjoy the moment, the view and the one you're with. This is not Denny's!"
1,Love this place. Great service and always fast. Not super busy for the times I've been here and always quiet which is good. I've tried a bunch of their pizzas and they're always amazing! Their salads are good too. Wish they had a bigger desert choice though. The Chipotle Chicken Pizza is a little too spicy but it was very good. I'd definitely go here again and recommend it to people in town for a visit since it has very simple but a expansive choice of foods.
1,Be very specific up front if you need the interior glass cleaned and dashboard dusted. I've unfortunately driven away and not had a decent clean inside of the car. \nNice staff and hard workers! Be sure to tip the guys up front vacuuming and not just on the tail end... Think about it: which do you think is harder !? lol
1,"All I can say is WOW! They were great! I have a townhouse in Las Vegas that I am preparing to rent out, and their website suggested vinyl planking. I had time constraints, so I went to thier showroom. They were very friendly and attentive, and made several suggestions on getting the floor ready to lower the price. They even have vinyl planking in thier office!\n\nThey held my hand through the whole process, and they put it in today and it looks awesome, and looks like a wood floor. I would highly recommed them to anyone."

0,"Very disappointed....would not go back.  Should have been able to tell by lack of customers on a Thursday night.  Tried two of the more popular dishes and neither really struck me as something I would come back for.  Hardly any meat, very small portions and the large bug on the wall behind me didn't do anything for my appetite.  Would rather pay more at Basil or head to Cuisine Malaya for my fix"
1,"This review is regarding Velvet at Posare Salon (inside the tanning section of the salon. She has her own room inside). I went to get eyelash extensions and she was the most pleasant, experienced and knowledgeable specialist. Velvet made me feel very welcome and her warm personality made me relaxed as she added eyelash extensions. It was an extremely positive experience. Her prices are reasonable and she does it all--everything from nails, facials, permanent make-up to eyelash extensions. She's incredible! Velvet has years of experience. You'll love chatting her up. Definitely worth the visit. Don't forget to tip for your services and that includes eyelash extensions."
0,"We stopped by here after Ash Wednesday mass today.  This is a peel your own, get down and dirty type of eatery.  They also give you a bib to protect your clothes from getting sauced or whatnot.\n\nFor $40, this is what we got:\n-1 Dungeness Crab:  We got this with the lemon pepper sauce with medium spicy.  The dungeness crab was good, but the lemon pepper sauce didn't do much for it.\n-1lb of shrimp:  We got this with the big bang sauce, which is a mixture of all the other sauce, at a medium spicy as well.  Those were large shrimps and were a tad  bit undercooked, which is fine by me since I rather have them undercooked than overcooked.   I didn't care for the sauce.\n-Turons:  Came 5 in an order.  I asked the server whether these were freshly made and fried, and have not been sitting out since earlier today.  She said they were freshly made and fried.  I took a bite off of one and it certainly did not taste freshly made and fried. \n\nThey have a special where Monday is crawfish for $6.99/lb and Wednesday is shrimp for $6.99/lb.  Without the special, they are $10.99/lb.  I tried the shrimp today, not a fan, so will not be coming back to try their Monday crawfish.\n\nService was pleasant, but won't be coming back for the food."
0,"I'm a small business owner who is in a constant need of recliners. They were unwilling to help me find a good time for delivery, I'm also a mom, it's hard to find child care , or be on call for an entire day. I set my delivery up for a Saturday. I asked if there were any chance i could have a window of time allotted, even 4 hours. They said no and suggested I cancel my order. I said no no, I want my chairs please deliver them and I'll deal with whatever happens it'll be ok. So I called this am to ask when they'd come, she said you cancelled your order. I said , no I didn't cancel, there must be a miscommunication, She said no there's no miscommunication. I don't know where I come from the customer is always right. I should've cancelled my order there. But still i naively thought its ok, I'll get my chairs... It's 10pm. I have a child to get home to. What do they expect?  A person to wait and wait and wait and to be treated like dirt in the mean time. Next time ill pay more just to be treated like a human whose money means something real. Thanks Pam \n\n\nAs I write this it's 10pm on Saturday, my order is still not here."

0,Was hoping for a decent Mexican restaurant in South Chandler but instead got a Mexican Denny's. Lots of sloppy food with no taste and a bit overpriced. Do have a nice patio and drinks were OK if that's all your looking for.  Too bad doubt it will last very long. Take your money elsewhere.
1,"Sweet Tomatoes is back! Nice to see the filed kitchen concept gone. They kept a few nice things from field kitchen such as a more elegant decor. Gone are those ridiculous payment cards, inability to have access to the salad dressings and the confusion. Back is the simple payment system, all you can eat concept, self food area, ice cream toppings, and customers. Nice to see Sweet Tomatoes back and with some of the good elements of field kitchen."
1,"Today was one of those days... I went to Anthem for nothing and was a little pissed. So I stopped by Rainbow to get some good food, because eating makes me happy. \n\nI had the 2 chili and cheese hotdogs. There was nothing skimpy about this dish. It was two huge dogs and a ton of homemade chili, topped with a cheese sauce. YUM. \n\nI had the potato salad as a side, it is a mix of potato, onion, black olive, and eggs. The ps was dry and a little boring. BUT at least it was homemade. \n\nThe cafe is clean and inviting, they have a couple of comfy chairs and a tv to watch and chill. They are open 7 days a week right now, but Sundays are really slow."
0,"Service ranges from atrocious to bad to just average, and at some point it's just not worth enduring and I give up.  Sure, I can cut some slack because it is a small locally owned business with family working there, but you have to draw the line somewhere.  \n\nMenu options range from rather standard breakfast fare to a few less common items, but the prices seem far too steep for a place like this.  It might be Scottsdale, technically, but it's a run down strip mall and it's rather modest on the inside as well.  You're just not paying for atmosphere or nice location here, so the prices are a little unexpected.  Food portions aren't particularly large for the price, and for some of the simpler breakfast plates like a basic 2 egg breakfast you're looking at around $8... whereas normally those similar plates are more like $5 at other breakfast spots.  Food is fairly good but nothing spectacular.   With the service and value issues, I think one ought to give this one a pass."
1,Best joint your going to find in the East Valley - and awesome bartenders
0,"Went through the drive thru and this Filipino lady forgot to give me dipping sauce for my nuggets or napkins. So I kindly asked her, how come you guys never ask me if I need any sauce like other places? She said, don't tell me how to do my job. Easy cowgirl!"
0,"We just gave up.  We were at the restaurant for almost two hours and nobody walked away full.  The waiters shaved off child-sized portions of meat and scurried away.  We requested the meat that we wanted and they nodded and walked off and we never saw them again.  Of the 15 types of meat on the menu we saw about seven or eight.  We asked for mint jelly (someone in our group loved lamb and mint jelly) at least six times over 20 minutes before they brought it.\n\nSome of the meat was \""okay\"", the salad bar was underwhelming and the sides were only good for taking up room at the table.  We were so disgusted with this place that we didn't even try dessert.  The service was so unbelievably horrible that we didn't leave a tip.  We had to get the hostess to take our credit card.  Maybe if they turned on a few extra lights, the waitstaff could've seen us sitting there.\n\nDo yourself a favor and go somewhere else or spend the extra money and have a meal you'll never forget at a real Brazilian steak house (instead of a meal you wish you could forget at this imposter)."
1,LOVE THIS PLACE. Dined here with my family while on vacation in Las Vegas. This place is spectacular and so delicious. Their meat and rice is to die for. I also love their side dishes! Hoping to come here again one day!
1,"I have tried the other one on shea, but this is close to home and work. I love the enviornment, the clientle, the healthy food, outstanding service and very reasonable prices. The waitstaff is great, the food always comes out quick and tastes amazing. Get anything with chicken as it is delicious and if you like hummus try it here. Also, they have great ice tea. This place is one of my favorites and well worth a try."
0,"filthy with apathetic staff and cold food.  you probably could catch an std there, too."
1,"I helped my daughter plan a Bachelorette Party for eight girls and I booked The Elara for their stay.  I didn't stay in the room but did go up to it and thought it was perfect.  They had a two bedroom suite with a full size kitchen which made it easy for them to fill the fridge with a ton of food and drink so they were able to economize on that aspect of their stay (which left more money for nice dinners, Chippendales, a spa treatment, etc., etc.).  And, speaking of economizing, the room rate was GREAT!  I had originally booked it about three months in advance but when I checked back about a month later the rate had decreased......no problem, the reservationist changed it and gave us the better rate.  But wait, another month later I checked the rate and it had gone down even more....no problem, the reservationist changed it again :-)\n\nWhen I picked up the girls I asked what they thought of the place and they all said they would definitely stay there again and they couldn't think of one thing to complain about.\n\nOn a side note, I drove them there in a 23 foot motorhome and parked it offsite so I can't comment on the parking.  However, I was able to pull into the front entrance area to drop off and pick them up without any problem.  Just make sure the whole party is present outside before you attempt this as they don't like an oversized vehicle loitering around that area for too long (understandably).\n\nOn another side note, if you're going with a big group (such a a bachelorette party) the motorhome was awesome!  The girls were able to party on the way there and sleep it off on the way back, they all loved it and the trip was a blast for everyone....even Mr. Stud the blow up doll.....haha!!!!"
0,"The bar is amazing but the staff is horrible. I have sent over 13 complaints to try to get a response from the owner or bar manager and have been ignored. We had our reception at this bar and it was a nightmare. Unorganized, rude staff, the waitresses could care less about anything accept for flirting with bartenders...Its so bad that the first time we visited, I had a drink and a sundae (which was amazing), but gave the girl a $100 bill and she came with change for a $20. I had to fight with her until she magically found the $100 bill!!! I should have known this was a good indication but because we used to love Toby, we tried our reception there. From start to finish it was a mess and we have wrote letters, called, emailed, hand delivered notices and NOBODY has called us back. Finally I called and tried to book a party for 100 people and got a call from Jenn in the booking department. I told her it was the only way I could get a call back...STILL IGNORED!! I could go on and on about how rude the staff is and how bad the owners have treated us after we had an unexpected, incorrect bill of $400.00 that night when we told the waitress in advance not once but 3 different times to cap us off at $250.00....Not once were we thanked for bringing so many people in that night, or paying the wrong bar tab, but totally and completely ignored.\nTwice the service/staff have messed up and nothing has been done. Its too bad because this place is exactly what Arizona was lacking. Too bad they dont care about return business."
1,Went in for an oil change and received the best service i have ever received at any car maintenance service location! I won't go anywhere else. Daniel (employee i delt with) provided exceptional service. He explained all of the things i needed fixed with my car in detail so i understood why and how these things were needed. He honored my coupons and they provided a free window and vacuum cleaning for my car complimentary. I was out within 20 minutes maximum. It was very professional fast and friendly service.
0,The golden nugget is a pretty neat hotel to visit downtown.. Its certainly one of the nicer ones (comparative to downtown hotels). We went to see the Gordan show and have dinner in their buffet. Man.. the buffet was horrible. The prime rib so scary rare.. the only two things I had was shrimp (which was way to soggy) and mac and chz.\n\nThats just sad for a Vegas Buffet.. we wont be visiting any of the eating places here again. (thank goodness I didnt try their expensive steak house)... Way to many awesome restaurants in Vegas to waste your time on anything under 4 starts..\n\nThe Highlight ?? Leaving .
1,"My husband and I had the pleasure of dining out at Del Frisco's while all the golf Glitterati were in town for Quail Hollow. It was quite a sight! We had a reservation for 8pm and it took about 15 minutes or so to get our table - however, we pleasantly passed the time at the bar. Being 7 months pregnant the busy bartender whipped me up a delicious juice cocktail and only charged us for my husband's drink - unnecessary but really nice. Thumbs up from the start.  \n\nOur waiter was very knowledgeable about the menu, making mostly excellent suggestions and even offering to split our salad knowing I was hesitant to order an appetizer and a salad before my meal. Our waiter suggested my husband and I share a crabcake and a 6 piece shrimp cocktail - each shrimp with a different sauce. Fabulous suggestion - great way to start the meal! The only hiccup at this point was that we were not served any water for at least 20 minutes after being seated. My husband had a drink so he didn't care but I was parched!  \n\nFor dinner, I ordered the 8 oz filet and my husband ordered the strip.  Our waiter suggested the creamed spinach as a side dish. By far, my filet was the best steak I have ever had. Perfectly cooked, beautiful light pepper crunch in every bite. I savored every forkful! Unfortunately,  the spinach was kind of bland so I took one bite and decided to enjoy my pure-beef meal instead of lessening the experience with my mediocre side. \n\nWe opted not to have dessert - maybe next time we will skip the apps and give dessert a try. When our check came we were double charged for our appetizers but our server apologized and quickly returned with an amended check.  \n\nThe service was truly seamless and never stuffy. Great food, great service. Fantastic place for a special night out."
0,"The only reason I am a member at this gym is because it is located close to my house. I need to update my payment with Edge due to an expired card, which they definitely do not let me forget. Yesterday I received 70 emails, flooding my inbox, and today so far I received 35 emails again all addressing the same matter. I replied back letting them know I will update my payment when I go in next, however I am still getting the emails. I had no choice but to block them.\nThis is not even the worst of it."
0,"one of the worst place i have ever been to.  the waiter upsale everything.  they dont know the menu.  they dont know what the sakes taste like.  if you like good sushi dont go here at all.  the miso cod, was cold and undercooked.  the tarte-tarte was bland.  actually, most of the food was very bland.  cocktails are under poured.  i wish, i had something postive to say but even the music sucked.  i would never go back there ever again.  the buffe was 4 star at TI compared to this place."
1,"My personal visit here was awesome.  Sassy, gorgeous and upscale. \n\nUpon check-in, they ran out of our regular room and upgraded us to a 1 bedroom terrace.  We called for extra towels and the service was quick, efficient, and friendly.  The hotel had a decent selection of eateries from fast food (pizza) to fancy dining.  Additionally, it seems that they have loose slots, because 3 of us were killing time on the penny slots and we all won.  My friend turned her $10 into $200 within a half hour!!\n\nTheir club Marquee gets packed per usual.  Overall, I can't complain about anything and had a great time in Sin City."
1,"This location is very cute. I had the curry chicken wrap and was amazed by the spicy, curry burst of flavor! I was expecting a good wrap, but nothing as fresh and refreshing, with the cucumbers and veggies giving you the balance of flavor. The crisp, green salad I opted for was very good, with radishes, an unlikely choice in a house salad. A thumbs up on this dish! Try it!\n\nI have been back about three times for that wrap - it's just that good!"
0,"For the price?  ...hell yes I've experienced better!  Place is alright but not work the price.  If you're big on golfing and too lazy to drive or 90 years old, this is your spot! Enjoy it."
0,"Go to classic car spa if you want to spend too much money on a crappy car wash. I have been going to this location for the past couple years, and it has been bought out and/or taken over by new ownership a couple times.   I used to get great service and a high quality wash, but lately it has been beyond disappointing. The sales people push you to upgrade your service, and then the extra you pay for doesn't get done.    In the past I would go there for an oil change, but got so frustrated by the mechanics trying to sell me on $300 in \""necessary\"" services every time.   So I deciding to go to NAPA for my oil change, and asked them to look into some of the recommended services that Classic had pushed.... None of them needed to be done, seriously!!!\n\nMy last time visit (yesterday) was the final straw for me.  I asked the sales lady how long the basic wash would take and she said 15-20 minutes.  Then she said if I upgrade the premium it would only take an extra 5 minutes and I would get a complete interior dressing opposed to the standard wipe down and vacuum. So I went with this option (+$9).   45 minutes later my car was done and I took a quick look inside and they didn't even wipe down the center consol.   I asked the guy to take care of this, so he did and then I get in my car and drive away... as I am driving I look at the dash and dashboard and realize they didn't even wipe certain areas and there was definitely no \""dressing\"".  They essentially gave me a half-ass basic car wash, charged me for a premium and took twice as long as they promised.  DO NOT GO THERE!!!"
1,Love this place. Used to be called Casa Bianca (along with 2 other Casa B locations in Madison which are now closed). Pizza hasn't changed since the Casa Bianca days. Big and Floppy slices. So good.
0,"First time to this place.  Have driven past it hundreds of times and always wondered if it was any good.  Well my kids were jonesing for a smoothie and we were right down the street so I figured we would give a local business a shot at our ridiculous smoothie obsession.  Upon walking in it was obvious that they were going for the \""Central Perk\"" vibe...it was homey but cool.  That's about all I can say in a positive sense.  The place was way under staffed and those who were working seemed overwhelmed and disorganized.  We place our orders for three regular sized (medium) smoothies which were advertised to be made with nothing but fresh fruit.  We were all anticipating a great drink.  After waiting about 15 minutes for our drinks (which seemed to be the norm for all customers) we were extremely underwhelmed by what we received.  They were definitely not using fresh fruit; it must have been some kind of concentrate as there was no hint of any real fruit in the drink.  Second they added a ton of ice to the drink and didn't even blend it well enough to consume through a straw.  All three of our drinks were lousy...I didn't finish mine.  The people working there seemed very nice but did not deliver a good product in a reasonable amount of time.  Three medium smoothies were $20.  I may have hit these guys on an off day but will be sticking to Jamba Juice in the future."
1,"Favorite Mexican Restaurant in the world.  \n\nThis is about as classy as you can get in East Mesa (I know, not a lot of competition in that category).  They've finished the new location and came out with a whole slew of new recipes.  My favorites include the flying saucer or the chicken mango salad.  I've set a goal to try something new each time I go here and haven't been dissappointed with the new menu items yet.  A bit pricey but with the new decor comes a new price tag.\n\nThere's a nice take-out addition too for the lunch crowd."
0,"Good service, average food, gross bread program, super high prices. Worth skipping; there are better dining experiences in Vegas."
0,"I am done with the Armitage. I have been here several times over the past few years and other than being overpriced, the food and service was always good. \n\nA couple of months ago, we went there for a birthday lunch. I ordered the Garden Veggie Pita. How can one mess up a veggie sandwich? How about putting it on a stale pita bread that cracks in two when you pick it up. Since it was my B-Day I didn't want to make any comments, especially since I wasn't the one paying. \n\nA couple of weeks ago we went there on a Sunday. I ordered the beef and Gorgonzola melt and my partner ordered a burger medium rare. When the plates were delivered I noticed that the slices of sirloin resembled small chunky pieces of beef jerky, the mushrooms were dry and shriveled and the Gorgonzola melt part looked like a wipe of mayo. I have had this before and the sirloin was always juicy and tender, on the medium rare side. I brought this to the servers attention who immediately said \""that's how it's made.\"" I told him that I've had it before and it definitely did not resemble my prior visits. No comment from the server. I ate it since at that point I didn't want to make a scene and it was horrid. My partner's \""medium-well\"" burger was very well done. She decided not to complain due to the fact that we don't really see what goes on in kitchens when we complain, do we? We didn't have an opportunity to even let the server know we were disappointed, since we didn't see him until the end of the meal. At that point, we made it clear that we were very disappointed, and showed him the doneness of the burger. I reiterated how horrible the beef jerky sandwich was and he then offered to comp. We settled on a free dessert. He also gave us coupons which was a nice gesture. Too bad he didn't listen to me the first time... \n\nTo the owner: when a repeat customer says he had something before, and that there is now something wrong, have your people pay attention. Don't make excuses for an incompetent kitchen. However, based on what your staff said, IF it is now your intention to provide an overdone dried out sliced sirloin sandwich, and  to overcook burgers regardless of the order, then you have no business in the food business. If not, then you better get in that kitchen and fix it, because this sort of news travels fast in my community. \n\nIn my book, two strikes and you are out. Sorry but there are better choices out there, and if I am going to spend 100 bucks on lunch it better be damn good. You're just not good anymore. I will not be back."
0,I honestly would rate them 0 stars . I have a brand new 13 accord with 8 thousand miles on it . Brought it to this wash and as they called my name to get my car I inspected it and there was a 6 inch scratch mark on my lower right bumper . Probably from there stupid car wash machine malfunctioning. I told the guy what the hell is that scratch and he denied that the machine did it I was like are u serious . And he goes it's from going over a curb in the parking lot . Last time I check going over a curb would leave scratches on the bottom not on the side of a damn bumper which was one single straight lined scratch not multiple . Anyways I'm never going back here again. Worst customer service ever . Don't recommend this wash to anyone . Messed up my 32 thousand dollar car that isn't even paid off yet.
0,"Let me start off with the positive: everyone here is SUPER nice. My dog loves the staff here. The follow up is nice, I enjoyed getting a call to see how my baby was doing after our visit. Also, I went in with my friend when her cat passed away and they were so sweet. Anyone with an animal knows that's one of the toughest things to go through, and they were great with my friend. \n\nNot so good... and it's funny because I've seen this term used in other reviews (and here I thought I was being all original)... Is that I feel like I'm at a used car lot. I bring the dog in, there's \""something\"" wrong that they look into, and after several tests and a TON of money later that magically isn't included in the monthly fee I pay for.... There still isn't an answer. I can tell you, as can anyone around him, that I have one of the healthiest and happiest dogs in the world, and what they assumed was wrong with him would make him lethargic, withdrawn, have a loss of appetite, and he's quite the opposite. I was also told that I'd be refunded whatever money I didn't use from the plan I pay for (I probably used 1/3 of it at most), and still haven't heard back from them. \n\nSadly, I'm on the lookout for another vet for my fur kid. But like I said, they were awesome for one of my good friends throughout her cat's life... maybe they're just better cat vets?"
0,the service was so slow we discussed stiffing the waiter (would never).  the food (hot wings and chicken and waffles) was very good! so were our mind bender drinks.
0,"I was bummed once I grabbed my plate and could see how small the buffet area really was. From the front it looked nice inside and it looked like everyone was enjoying their food. After standing in a slow line and paying $15 for a bottle of champagne with my brunch, we explored the buffet. The food was less then average, similar to a local buffet for 7.99 in my home town. Most of us tried to find something we liked and ended up staying with safe food choices like toast and mac n cheese. Just go elsewhere and pay roughly the same for much better food."
1,"So many Carnegie haters!  Really?\n\nI'm an East Coaster living in Northern California.  You want marginal deli food?  We've got it for you, in abundance!  But ah, when I get to Vegas, I know I'm going to have kosher dill pickles and  Carnegie Deli cheesecake.\n\nI could care less about the gargantuan sanwiches or the lobby coffee shop atmosphere.  It doesn't even bother me that the nearest restroom is 10 billion miles away.  What matters is the cheesecake.\n\nThe touch decision?  Strawberry or rugalech?  Through my amazing power of persuasion (bullying, perhaps) I manage to convince my travel companion to order the other.\n\nSO SO SO SO SO SO GOOD.  Cheesecake heaven.  Seriously.\n\nThis is the only time I *EVER* order milk, anywhere.\n\nIt's a simple equation, really.  Water and pickles, milk and cheesecake."
1,"Very delicious! Nice atmosphere and very clean and new inside.....would recommend the calamari, wonton soup and chix fried rice!! Yummy!"
1,"I came here with my brother because I had a coupon that was about to expire. The place is pretty small, but there are lots of places to sit. My brother ordered a pork combo burrito ($5.75) and a pint of beer ($1). I ordered a chicken ensalada ($6.95). The burrito came wrapped in foil. It was so huge it looked like it was going to explode in my brother's face. He took his first bite and said, \""*%#! yeah, this is dank!\"" Translated into normal English, that means it was delicious. He was also very pleased about being able to get a pint of beer for a buck. That's a pretty sweet deal and I think it's all day everyday. My ensalada wasn't what I expected. I was expecting it to be a salad in a tostada BOWL, but it was actually a big salad on top of a flat tostada in a foil bowl. All the juices of the huge salad made the little tostada all soggy on the bottom, so I didn't eat it. The salad itself was good though, I was just expecting to get it in a crunchy tostada bowl that I could tear apart and turn into chips. Even though I wasn't too fond of my salad, I am still a fan of this place. My brother loved his burrito, they have lots of specials, and the prices are cheap!\n\nTips:\n*Monday night sliders - $1 Santa Fe sliders 4-9pm\n*Taco Tues - $1 beef tacos 4-9pm\n*Wed - 1/2 price breakfast burritos til 11am. $6 Roadrunner pizza 4-9pm\n*Thurs - $6.50 bottomless bowl of green chile stew 4-9pm\n*Fajita Friday - %6 chicken, $7 steak, $8 shrimp fajitas 4-9pm\n*Sat rib night - $8.95 Red Chile Pork Ribs Adovada w/ green chile cheddar mashed potatoes and Calabacitas\nSunday - 2 for 1 breakfast burritos all day long\n*Carlito's Special Lager $1"

0,"Once again another update to my service and experience at Chapman Volkswagen.  I have know come to expect the worst from this dealership but want to show my loyalty to a company so i have continued to have my car serviced there.  Well after this last experience that the time of doing anything at Chapman has come to an end.  Once again my check tire light come on so before driving all the way to this dealership i had my tire checked to ensure it was just the air in the tires.  Come to find out i had a screw in my tire at the point that it couldnt be repaired.  Already knowing this i took my car to the dealership to have to tire replaced.  With my past experience of the service department not wanting to help anyone i called ahead to make sure that i was going to be able to get the car in to get a new tire today.  The gentleman who answered the phone had the worst attitude have heard of all time.  He explained that wouldnt be a problem and i drove my car over.  When i pull up in the service department there was one guy just standing there talking so i waited.  All of sudden this younger gentleman wearing a black pants and black hoodie needles to say i had no clue he even worked there walked up and said have you been helped.  I explained to him that i need to have my tires check that i believe that i have a screw in my back right tire.  (this next part is going to be word for word of what happen next).  He said \""you have a giant screw in your tire\"", I said \""OK i will need to get that replaced\"", he said \""it is going to have to be replaced\"", my next response was \""can we get this done today\"", he stood and looked at me and goes \""that shouldnt be a problem\"" and he continued to look at me.  Needless to say talking to a brick wall would have been more productive.  He finally decided to say well i am going to need information from you.  My next response was do you have the tire in stock? As this is the second tire i have purchased form Chapman i figured it wasnt going to be in stock like the first one.  He said it shouldnt be a problem we keep them in stock.  I went the waiting dull and cold waiting room once again.  He returned to tell me that it would take about two hours and this point is when i found out Chapman has already done away with their loaner program.  Nice enough he they offered to comp my enterprise for the \""day\"".  I asked how long it would take and his response was 2 hours.  I took the enterprise rental and went on with my day, he explained that he would call in two hours to let me know the car was done.  Three hours went by and still had no return phone call.  I called in and spoke with the \""customer service manager\"" as I had spoken with her twice before and she was very interested in making sure my problems were fixed from the past experience.  She informed me that she would find out what was going on and would call me back.  Well she never called back but i got a call from the service advisor.  He explained that they didnt have the tire in stock and would have to order it and would have to keep my car over night.  Fast forward to the next day, i received a phone call from the service adivsor at 2pm letting me know the tire came in and they hadnt started replacing the tire yet.  He then called again letting me know i can pick my car up and that the service department closes at 6pm.  When arriving at Chapman to return the enterprise car and pick up my car more headache starts.  I got there before 6pm and the service advisor was not there.  There was only one guy who most interested in his personal conversation that seeing if i needed help.  So i walked back to the sales office and asked if someone could come to service so i can pick up my car.  The gentleman i asked goes \""there is no one there\"".  Once again if i asked to have someone sent to service i am going to assume that there is no one there.  As i am going to walk out he very rudely said \""well i dont work in service\"".  Needless to say he never sent anyone over there, so i walked back to service and stood there an waited.  When no one came i walked up to someone and said do you work here? And said yes and i informed him i needed to pick up my car.  His response \""I didnt know you were waiting everyone just walks up to me\"".  I got my finally got my car back and asked him to speak with enterprise to let them know Chapman will be paying for my rental car so the funds can be released from my credit card.  I went back to the front area to ask to speak with the customer service manger or the general manager and the response that i was given was \""it is after 5 o'clock\"".  \nThe point that needs to be addressed is the quality of service that is being provided by this car dealership.  There is no way me, my family, or anyone that i come in contact will ever purchase a car from the dealership."
1,"Found this place by happenstance while trying to find Albertsons. We came in on a Monday and discovered their half off tapas special. We admittedly went a little crazy and boy were we glad we did! The tapas was amazing. We ordered the grilled asparagus, tempura artichoke hearts, sea scallops, calimari, ribs, and ox tail. All of these dishes were incredible. \n\nUnfortunately, they were out of the escargot. Guess that leaves something for next time! :) We finished dinner off the Spanish coffee and the lava cake. \n\nWe will definitely be back and with friends/family too!"
0,When I came to Vegas this place got so much talk but really these were the worst tacos I've ever had in my life the meat was so gross I couldn't even eat them! Not to mention the horrible service! definitely NEVER coming back!!!
1,I used vegasbooths in May 2014 for my wedding at the Suncoast. Robert did an awesome job communicating with me the whole time before the wedding to make sure I got everything I wanted. Him and his whole staff were great. I'll definitely use them again if I have any big events. They made our wedding a hit and everyone had a blast all night taking fun pictures that they could take home with them :) I know I will recommend to anyone who wants a good time. The music just added fun to the booth as well they have open or enclosed booths!
1,"Oh Pin Kaow, do you ever do wrong?  I hope not, because it's all been great so far.   This location is next to my work, Pin Kaow 1 near my house, and it's all delicious no matter where in the valley!\n\nTheir decor is just as rad as their other locations;  it's like a bit of Thailand has slipped through the strip mall paradise of this Henderson commercial center.  And their outdoor patio is nice;  maybe not in 106, but it's nice when it's not en fuego outside.\n\nLast visit I had a great chicken satay and a green curry that was savory to say the least.  Great portions.  My only sad moment was when the appetizer was a dollar less than the entree.  Ouch!    \n\nStill, a delightful establishment."
1,"I was at the Aria hotel craving some pizza when I yelped to see what was around me. I'm so glad this place came up because it completely satisfied my 4am pizza craving. Pepperoni is pretty good, but I liked the white pizza the best. It was very garlic-y which I love. I love the stone grilling process because it always makes the best crunchy, flavorful crust. I went back the next day for more, it was so good."
1,Met them at the home and garden show and will be ordering our doggie door soon.  Great presentation of a quality product.
1,"This is an outstanding place. From the menu to the exceptional customer service, you will not be disappointed."
0,"Nothing too complex here. Everything tasted well, but there's definitely room for improvement. Meatloaf was cold, the manager did take care of it. Green beans, needed a minute more in the saut\u00e9 pan.. Fried chicken was good, the dark meat was moist, crisp skin, but the white meat was dry. Homemade potato chips was overly salted. Deviled prosciutto eggs, needed more than just prosciutto. No hostess to greet you. You have to find them. My Singapore sling was well made. My server was good, but I knew she was swamped. I guess a culinary dropout makes meatloaf, a graduate makes a terrine... Maybe it was a terrine, that's why it was cold...."

1,"Came to Dr. Whittenberg on referral from a couple of people to take care of foot issue.  Though I was a bit anxious going into it, Dr. W and his practice made me feel very comfortable.  \n\nMade my appointment, was brought to a room (on-time, gasp!) where Dr. W made an evaluation, answered my questions, went to work, made a little small talk, and then off I went.  \n\nSimple, easy, comfortable, clean facilities.  Will not hesistate to use/refer Dr. W again for any foot issues."
1,LOVE it!
1,"The food here is really good, the service is eh.  But I am giving this 4 stars because the food really was just that good.  The bread pudding was the best I've ever had and I don't LOVE bread pudding-- but I LOVED this one.  Also, they make their own ice creams and their are delicious.  The fish I had was extremely fresh. I am no food critic, but I did grow up on the East Coast beaches of NC, so I can say with certainty the fish is fresh.  I love that they use local vendors for most of the food and the atmosphere of the restaurant is cozy and hip.  \n\nMy complaint, the service.  Flighty is a word that comes to mind.  The food took a really long time to come out and I have yet to figure out if that was the kitchen staff OR our waiter not putting our order in on time.\n\nAll that said, this is a place I will most certainly come back to."
0,"Woah....not sure what is up with the high reviews here, but Yelp caught me with my pants down on this one.  It was a Thursday Night and we wanted to catch the Colts play.  I reviewed Yelp reviews and found this bar to have high reviews...so we took a cab down to The Quad.  I knew nearly right away when I saw the Quad that this might be a miss.  Trailer Park city much?  We get to the bar, and it is literally that.....a bar.....built into the casino like any bar at a casino.  Ugh.\n\nThe selection of beers were huge...but at that price? holy crap.  Brainless on Peaches 22oz for $24?!?!?! Um, what? in what country?  Are these supposed to be Pesos?\n\nWe left there after the 1st quarter and went to Lagassee Stadium.\n\n\nI suppose I can see people who are gambling coming here to drink while playing video poker and watch whatever is on TV....but man are there better options."
0,"I've been to Tommy V's three times, and every experience has decreased since then. \n\nThe Caprese Salad was wonderful the first time I visited. The lobster ravioli was okay, but never again. My boyfriend disagrees, but I'd argue I have a more advanced palate. Finally, tonight I ordered the handmade pasta trio. It's $19 for four raviolis and 7 gnocchi. The ravioli were two spinach and some sort of cheese blend I can't recall off the top of my head. The other two ravioli were wild mushroom. The spinach ravioli were forgettable, and the gnocchi were soggy. The wild mushroom ravioli were really good, but two wild mushroom ravioli are not worth $19. \n\nSo, it looks like we're going to have to break up."
0,"I would much rather write a positive review than a negative one, but my experience here was beyond unacceptable, so I felt I had the responsibility to report. \nI recently rented a lawn mower from this store. The employe I dealt with told me the $75 deposit would be refunded with cash upon return. \nI returned to find a different employe who informed me that the policy was actually refunding my card at days end. \nI explained that I was told differently, he offered neither apology nor explanation, just told me to check back tomorrow. \nNo refund the next day. No refund the day after. In the meantime, I had a returned check at my bank due to funds not being there (thanks HD) and incurred a $35 fee. So I returned, was given the run around and demanded a manager. This guy was worse than his employees! Told me \""if you can't afford the deposit, maybe you should rent elsewhere!\"" He then promised to refund my card that day and I left. Well well well, imagine my surprise when checking my account the next morning, I discovered not a credit, but another $75 charge! And with this, another $35 back fee! \nNeedless to say, I angrily returned to speak with the HD manager, and he rudely informed me it was out of his hands and I had to call corporate headquarters. Thanks to the fraud department at my bank, I finally got my money back, but it took 4 weeks, and $70 in bank fees. The initial cost of rental was great, but due to misinformed employees and a careless manager, the experience cost me $70 extra, countless hours of my life, and a world of frustration. I have nothing positive to say about this place, and highly encourage anyone renting equipment to go anywhere else for higher quality products and customer service that would surely dwarf that of Home Depot"
1,"Great coffee, hard to find but well worth the trouble. Had a latte just the right amout of foam. Very personable barista."
0,"Not worth the money or the wait in line. I went to the buffet for Brunch on a Saturday... The food was just \""ok\"". It was edible, but nothing to go run home and tell your mother about it. The waffles were too hard and dry. The meats were extra fatty and very rare. The eggs were super runny. The breakfast sausage was good, but that's pretty hard to screw up. The pizza was ok too. The muscles were dry. The king crab legs were ok for buffet standards. The pork belly was juicy & delicious, They did not have too many options for desserts, just your standards, I tried almost one of everything but was only happy with the keylime tart. \n\nOverall I think the Belliago Buffet is more on the old school vegas vibe. With standard options. The newer hotel buffets on the strip (i.e. Cosmopolitan, Aira, etc) seems to give not only the standards but different variations of them as well as providing other unique options for the same price as this buffet."
0,"Basically, the food looks great but tastes underwhelming and disappointing for its price - any other $50 buffet would be better (i.e. Bellagio, Wynn, etc.) Note: I went for dinner.\n\nPROS:\n- food is displayed aesthetically and in small portions. Probably the most well-displayed food of all the buffets (dishes are served in miniature pots, etc.)\n- they serve bone marrow, which is pretty damn cool\n- there is a wide selection of food (steak, crab legs, etc.)\n- they have a variety of flavored gelato (Nutella!)\n- great service \n\nCONS:\n- ALL...literally all the items I tried were underwhelming and plain - I've had better. THIS IS THE MAIN REASON I'M GIVING 2 STARS AND PROBABLY WOULD NOT COME BACK AGAIN: the first thing I tried wasn't that good. Same for the second, third, etc. and at the end of the meal, I realized most everything tasted subpar and plain. The sushi was the generic, \""fake\"" sushi type - but none of the Vegas buffets ever have real, quality sushi anyway. The salmon was dry, the bone marrow was bland, the marinade for the kalbi beef wasn't good and it probably wasn't marinated for very long because the taste faded. The best thing was probably the mac n' cheese.\n- not a wide selection of cheeses (there were only 3 and they were pretty standard) and no crackers or dried fruits to go with it.\n- not a lot of fruits (only bananas and a plate of pears and apricots). I'm used to seeing pre-cut fruits at buffets at this price. \n\n\nCONCLUSION:\nThere are better buffets out there. For $50/person, I am comparing this to other ~$50 buffets and this one isn't worth it. Good presentation, but poor quality and taste considering the price."
0,"Our order took ages to arrive - the delivery guy couldn't find us and went back to the shop (twice) before they got around to calling us. The food was pretty disgusting when we finally got it, and it's none too cheap, either. We haven't been back. I had to add one star to post this review but I wouldn't give it any at all."
1,"The doggies were a little nervous but the two ladies who helped us made them feel comfortable. One lady came from the back and just picked Frankie up and another lady started clipping. Same with Uggy. I think the credit card transaction took longer than the nail clipping!! My husband appreciated the way the place does business. 10 min, $5 a dog, nails clipped. Thanx for a great experience."
1,"Dr. Lyon is a caring and professional who treats you like a person, not a patient. He has performed several adjustments on me and always listens to my concerns. He takes great care in ensuring that I am comfortable and eases any anxiety that I have before adjusting me.\n\nI have worked with other doctors who have performed adjustments but have not taken the time or had the patience to make me feel like they care about me. Their techniques were a bit aggressive and I was more anxious in their offices. \n\nDr. Lyon has always worked with my schedule and is very accommodating. I have recommended friends and family to see him and he has worked wonders with their conditions. I would happily recommend him and will continue to visit his office for my needs."
0,"When I planned to meet a friend of mine for a mid-afternoon meal, I asked her where she would like to go. She recommended Fuzzy's, which was under new ownership, because their prices were are reasonable and it has a good atmosphere. \n\nWe met as agreed, shared a pleasant meal, and decided to stay after paying our original check to in order to finish catching up on each other's lives. We started a new bill, ordered a couple of drinks, and much to our dismay the waitress \""misplaced\"" my friend's debit card. \n\nAlthough the food was actually very good, the owner of the establishment could use some classes and/or seminars in best practices for customer service/satisfaction. My friend asked the waitperson to bring the manager to our table to handle this very serious situation because my friend had already been a victim of credit/ID theft and was extremely upset that history might very well be repeated. \n\nInstead of coming directly to our table and reassuring my friend that he was \""on the case,\"" the manager was conversing with our waitperson in the back of the restaurant allegedly gathering her facts from her. My friend became more and more anxious and was about to burst into tears. I walked around the restaurant in order to scan each area for the missing debit card (since no one else seemed to be doing anything of any value). \n\nAfter making full circle, I approached the manager (who turned out to be the owner) and advised him that my friend was becoming increasingly upset and needed to speak with him. He turned to me and talked to me as if I was a kindergarten-aged child (I have a Masters degree) and advised me he would be over as soon as he got the \""facts\"" from the server (never mind that my friend was the victim). I told him not to talk to me as if I were a child and again requested that he at least speak with my friend to assure her that he was \""on the case.\"" He eventually made an appearance about 15-20 minutes later. \n\nWithout trying to at least sympathize (let alone empathize) with my friend's anxiety, fears, etc., he became increasingly agitated with her because she was trying to tell him that the waitperson brought the charge slip to our table for her signature without the card and should have never done so. He took it as a personal affront, advised my friend that complaining about what happened would not make her card \""magically reappear,\"" and exacerbated her already anxious mood by arguing with her instead of placating her. \n\nAfter giving her contact information to the proprietor, she and I left the establishment and returned to her home. Moments later she received a call informing her that the card was located and would she return to retrieve it. We returned to the restaurant where my friend returned cash to the server (who had taken the money out of her own pocket to ease the situation) and received her debit card from the \""night manager.\"" Apparently the owner decided to use him and a bouncer to make sure we got in and out of there as soon as possible (for two women who have grown children of their own). \n\nOooooh....a bouncer! We felt very dangerous after that. How scary we must appear to be! The bouncer, a guy wearing a muscle shirt and tattoos going up both arms, followed us out to the parking lot to apparently make sure we didn't spread our happiness to the patrons on the patio. \n\nFor the inconvenience of having to cancel her debit card when she returned home (it was in a compromised status for over 2 hours), being embarrassed by the owner of the restaurant in front of a restaurant full of patrons, and being followed by a bouncer (she's probably 5'2\"" tall in her sandals) to make sure she didn't stir up trouble, she was given a business card with a note for future servers to honor her with a free meal (AS IF!).\n\nIf the rating was solely based on the food, service (from a different waitperson), and atmosphere that we experienced for the first few hours we were there, Fuzzy's would receive a five-star rating from me. However, due to the owner's attitude and performance (which rated a negative five-star status), I will give them a two-star rating for the quality and quantity of the food, the atmosphere, and the friendliness of the other patrons. \n\nIf you still want to try Fuzzy's food, go for the chili made with ground buffalo meat, the buffalo chicken wrap (I had the grilled versus the fried), and the chicken Caesar salad.\n\nI would caution you, however, to pay in cash and go when the owner is on vacation (or get your order \""to go\"")."
0,"I have been to this establishment a few times because it is the closest to my home. Each time I sit in the drive thru wondering why it takes so long to make coffee beverages and what is the point of a drive THRU. However, I have gone inside as well and the service is still slow. My order has never been wrong, but I always have to leave with ample time for work. The people that work there have an okay attitude -not really super pleasant, but not rude or mean."
1,"Great facility!  I have stayed here several times since they re-opened.  After numerous frustrating stays at chain-motels (that charge the same or more per night) I was so happy to find this quaint little boutique hotel.  \n\nThe rooms are beautifully appointed, clean, and surprisingly quiet.  I love the old-town ambiance paired with brand new firm mattresses, plush pillows, large flat screen TV, and modern bathrooms.  \n\nI am so grateful for the gluten-free food options and personalized, special attention provided by the staff during every visit. \n\nIt is also an enormous relief to have great espresso in Phoenix - right in the lobby!  And, the wine bar features a broad selection of great wines."
0,"Read alot of reviews from Rice Paper before going there.  It is an old house, remodeled inside for seating about 30 people. It was loud inside and uncomfortable seating was the first impression for we had chose a high top table. There was also outside seating.  I was excited to try the Pho based on the several outstanding reviews I read.  I do know now that all reviews were not on the RicePaper site, since there were no bad reviews.  My girlfriend ordered pho tai and I had the pho mignon. The first taste was ok, but we both agreed that the soup was saltier than other Vietnamese restaurants.  The meat was tender with a faint metallic taste.  The rice noodles were good, but a skimpy portion left me wanting more. We had the spring roll with chicken breast, and it was ok, but only half the size for a higher price than the best competitors in town.  We eat Vietnamese food three times a week on average, and not mentioning the service at Rice Paper(because its below par) we could not wait to erase Rice Paper from our three a week Vietnamese fix.  Overall the attraction is location, but there is hardly any parking available behind the house"
1,Bring your cash and get the green chile!!! Good stuff!
1,"I've been a few times, and overall the atmosphere has been very chill without too many rowdy ASU students. \n\nService in the dining area was a little off-- orders were forgotten--but the place is new enough so I understand. \n\nThe food is delicious, they serve Orion, and have a great selection of sake and are very knowledgeable and eager to let you sample, especially if you sit at the bar.\n\nThe owners and staff are all really cool and I love that I can go after midnight on the weekends. I just wish it were a bit cheaper."
0,"It is expensive because, hey, it's Vegas. But for future reference, pick a hotel on the strip. Or at least a hotel that is kept up on a daily basis. Enough said."
0,"located in the old \""vegas diner\"" sometimes mistaken for a 5 & diner.like there's not already enough indian places barely surviving, and there's a reason the last place went out of business. it's right next door to the hash house a go-go .i wanna know who does the planning for picking the locations? do they not do any research?"
1,"Very good food and very authentic! I felt like I was eating in Greece rather than in Pittsburgh. The hummus is delicious and I took some home to eat with a spoon. I would definitely recommend this place, it's quite an experience."
0,"This place has reasonable prices, generous portions, fast service, and is very conveniently located (for me!).  That said, convenience isn't quite enough to make me want to come back here.\n\nI ordered the Ma Po Tofu and some vegetable lo mein.  Granted, I have never had Ma Po Tofu.  I'm not really sure what it's \""supposed\"" to taste like.  But what I got from China Garden was SALTY.  So very salty, to the point where I could barely taste any other flavor.  BLEH.  Also, there was a piece of shrimp shell in my Ma Po Tofu....weird.\n\nThe vegetable lo mein was pretty good, but honestly that's kind of hard to completely mess up.\n\nMy boyfriend had the boneless spare ribs combo.  His eggroll was downright gross.  The insides were a uniform gray.  He asked me to take a bite of it to confirm how weird it was.  I sunk my teeth in and didn't even go any further...the texture and flavor was so disgusting.\n\nI'm disappointed by this place, especially since our food SMELLED so good (well, except for that eggroll...)"
1,"went there for a friend's birthday party. the food is really good. loukoumades, lamb, octopus, eggplants, can't go wrong with those. didn't like the cheese dish as it was too salty\n\nit is expensive though. came out to $75 per head but we did eat quite well"
1,"What a brilliant place!\n\nI almost didn't write this review, so as not to let such a sublime secret become less of a secret.\nIt's a bar within a bar.\n\nIt's inside The Commonwealth, which for me is a mildly interesting, but in the end not much more than a generic hipster joint full of over-hormoned yahoos, and too much negative space and negative intelligence.\n\nBut for those who are never want to be \""on the radar\"", who like to be zen and unseen,  it's worth walking through the Commonwealth circus to get to The Laundry Room, which by comparison is quiet, thoughtful, sophisticated, expensive, and refreshing.\n\nI can't wait to go back."
1,"I had a tremendously positive experience at this Westin (the 12th-ish or so I've stayed at this year).  \n\n- Beautiful, very new-seeming property\n- Great location pretty close to anything you'll need\n- Reasonable prices on self-parking\n- Excellent service\n- Extremely clean, well-kept and comfy space (I was on the 22nd floor...so I suppose I can only speak for it)\n- Upgraded to a corner suite that was amazing---very well appointed, functional and comfortable\n\nAgain, this is my 12th or so Westin stay this year---and it has been the best of all of those."
0,"First off - we were looking for somewhere to eat in the west valley and Kabuki Sushi popped up on the GPS as being nearby. Thinking it was the same Kabuki that is at Tempe Marketplace and Westgate I was excited. Um. Yeah. Definitely not the same place. I'll start with the good:\n\n- Service was very attentive and friendly (actually, the service sort of saved this from being a 1-star experience)\n- Huge selection of specialty rolls\n- Kid-friendly (the sushi chefs even entertained my daughter)\n\nNow, the bad.\n\n- The place smelled like fish. Not a good sign.\n- 99% of the rolls were made with \""crabmeat\"". Even the Philly roll, which is very very odd. \n- The food was very expensive for the quality. Two rolls made with mostly crabmeat and some nigiri, plus a couple 4.50 beers, quickly became a 70 dollar \""quick bite.\""\n- The menu has pictures. Not very appetizing pictures.\n\nI probably should have known better than to eat sushi anywhere in the avenues. And I'm still kind of baffled by how there can be two completely different restaurants in the same city with the same name? Either way, I will actively seek another alternative next time I'm in that area."
1,This place has done it right. It has a comfortable atmosphere and yet it is entertaining and classy all at the same time. There is live music on the weekends. The happy hour special s are excellent. I am working on trying every single dish on the happy hour menu. The bruschetta is a must! They have a lot of choices on their wines too. The slice of cucumber in my water becomes the cherry on top to this wonderful place hidden in Mesa.
0,Travel forever for what a waste of time. Food was Average new Chef needs training. Good luck to this place! Don't waste your time and gas. Try the Boulders it's closer!\nService was the worst diner service. Learn how to open a bottle of wine!\nBetter yet go to Cafe Bink same area way better food and service!
0,Really disappointing. The inside is nothing great at all. It really  doesn't stand out. The restaurants and places to eat were not that great at all.
1,"We had a GREAT time with Andrew (our host/promoter) on the VIP UNLTD club crawl! There was a group of 5 of us (3 guys, 2 girls) and this was my first club crawl experience. What a solid introduction! \n\nWe snagged a deal for this crawl from Yipits and we couldn't pass it up. The price was too good!\n\nMy group showed up at around 10:15 pm at the Evening Call at Mandalay Bay for check in, but right before that Andrew texted me, asking if we were on our way, and he was willing to wait for us since we were running a little late. Upon arrival he was really friendly and funny as HELL! Definitely provided us with laughs and good conversation the whole night. He also provided us with several rounds of shots between stops. Pretty dope. \n\nThe venues were NICE! We hit up Light, Mix, and the Foundation Room, which are all inside Mandalay Bay. The final stop was LAX inside Luxor. They were all nice and super fun, especially FR and LAX because they had a nice mix of EDM as well as radio songs/hip- hop. Overall we were satisfied though. We never waited in line more than maybe 3-5 mins and everything went smoothly. Each stop was roughly an hour. \n\nI'd totally do a crawl with Andrew and VIP UNLTD again! I look forward to another in depth discussion about hip hop with him, haha! Good times!"
0,"We visited this establishment after a recommendation with a friend. In all honesty I would have rather gone home and cooked my own meal.\n\nWe arrived and waited roughly five minutes at the door to be seated. The hostess was very friendly and accommodating (some of our party spoke english only, some french). \n\nWe were seated next to the kitchen doors and our server came, made some beer recommendations and took out drink orders. We were not asked if we wanted water, no forks or knives, napkins were given. \n\nAfter about 15 minutes our drinks FINALLY arrived, only delivered by a different server. He gave us our drinks and walked away. We had to call him back to place our food orders. The entire time we were ordering he was rude.He made rude comments under his breath when HE misunderstood what someone was trying to order, when asked to make an order without onions he replied very rudely that \""If it's on the menu than that's what comes on it, We do not make substitutions at all\"".\n\nWe are roughly a 25 minutes into our dinner experience now. No water, No napkins, no drink refills,  nothing. \n\nTen minutes later the awful server returns with place mats, forks and knives. One of our party asks for a napkin as her drink was sticky and making a mess. He turns his mats over to show he has napkins, rolls his eyes and scoffs.\n\nThe starter comes, and it was cold. Honestly I wasn't surprised.\n\nFinally our food arrives (brought out by the kitchen staff? not the waiter?). 2 orders of fish and chips (cold), A \""texas burger\"" with cold greasy onion rings on top and cold fries, a \""California Burger\"" with ice cold fries,soggy bun, and a black slice of avocado. \nI would have complained but surprise surprise, our server was nowhere to be seen.\n\nWe finished eating and a DIFFERENT server came to collect our dishes, offered us another drink, desert and coffee. She was very friendly and if I could have tipped her and the hostess I would have. \n\nI will never be returning to this establisment ever. I will tell anyone who asks about it to avoid it like the plague. I have had a better dining experience at Burger King. \n\nIn short, Terrible food and even worse service."
1,"This place is absolutely wonderful! The restaurant may not be very spacious, but the food is great. The food is also very cheap, considering the food proportion they give out. Overall, I recommend this place for its authentic, inexpensive, and great quality foods."
0,"Palm beach hours say they open at 8am. I showed up at 8:10am, salon was still closed. I understand people oversleep, etc but these are the people your trusting with your tanning experience. Low responsibility and reliability. I stayed until 8:40am and still no one was there."
1,"My wife and I have discovered  the best pizza/Italian restaurant in Union County. The pizza is exceptional. The chicken parm is put together with ingredients that will challenge your Italian grandmother. Even the basic meatball sub is delicious. Fantastic!\nThe restaurant is sports bar oriented, but could easily be changed into an upscale dining venue. It's well worth your time."
1,Have been here 2 times and the Empanada's are very good! I am disappointed that the place is empty because it has serious potential. Both visits were during the Christmas shopping season and during lunch time. \nOne of the best choices is the Samosa Veggie. Very good blend of spices!

0,"Oh Caffe Boa, I don't even know where to start! First off I never give a place 2 stars and it would have been 1 star if I had not had a pleasant experience before my most recent one!\n\nOne of my best friends was planning her 25th birthday dinner and she was trying to decide where to go and I suggested we go to Caffe Boa since she has never been and I had such a great experience the first time I had gone, I thought it would be a good idea to go again... Well I was wrong!\n\nFirst off I had asked the hostess to do me a favor of surprising my friend with a gift from her boyfriend, since he was out of town and was not able to be there, and they were very friendly and said that would not be a problem, I was very appreciative of them doing that for me. My friend had also brought cupcakes in as her dessert and we asked if we could just put them in their fridge until after we had dinner and the owner had mentioned to me there would be a small cake cutting fee for holding them (he never mentioned how much it was), at this moment I thought ok $3-$5, no biggie, I thought it was odd and had never been to a restaurant where they have a cake cutting fee!  our whole group went in to wine and dine, no expense was too much. We were looking at their wine list and some of us wanted to sample a few wines to see which one we would like with our dinners! We were refused saying that they don't do samples... I have never been to a restaurant where we couldn't sample a wine before ordering! Ok so no big deal we moved on from that and just ordered what sounded good and went from there...\n\nWe were told the bread was in the oven and it would be out in just a few moments (I work in the service industry as well and I know this happens so we were not too worried about it). The bread did take a little while but when we were finally brought some there was not nearly enough to go around the table so we asked for a second round of bread as well as the delicious butter (I think the butter was the best part about the night) the second round of bread was not brought out to us until after we received our meals. The food was not as good as I remembered when I dined previously and some had to send their entrees back and order new ones which took quite a while too, especially since it was pasta. \n\nLastly the moment that made the whole experience at Caffe Boa not pleasant one bit... Our server brought out the cupcakes, my friend opened up all her presents and dinner was coming to an end so we all got our bills... well on our bill we saw that we were charged a $25 cake cutting fee for CUPCAKES!!! Needless to say we asked the owner/manager to come and speak with us and he didn't handle it in a very professional manner at all, he was arguing back and forth with all of us, saying that they have a family to feed and us bringing in cupcakes from another place is taking away revenue from their restaurant (our bill was well over $300 and we all know how much those glasses of wine are marked up.) Then they proceeded to argue with us further stating that they have a pastry chef who could have made the cupcakes or some type of birthday dessert, but this was never made aware to any of us in the group! You would think when my friend placed the reservation for a birthday dinner, they would mention something along the lines of those services to help generate that revenue. Overall the owner never reversed the fee, we finally just paid the bill and left... They will never have us as a repeat customer (which didn't seem to matter to the owner because he treated us like he didn't need our business.) \n\nI am very disappointed Caffe Boa!"

Myself, being the event planner I am, wanted to make his birthday special and I wanted him to have an amazing time! So I got him a table at firehouse. \n\nWe get there, skipped the line and told the guy I had a table. He then called the manager over, Josh, and he SO kindly escorted us to our table and got us settled right in. He got me THE best table in the house over looking the whole club behind the bar! It was awesome!! Josh was so cool and consistently checked up on us. I don't know why some of the other reviews say he's rude cause he was SO nice and accommodating. At one point he even brought my whole party a round of shots on the house! Our cocktail waitress Robyn was even more awesome! She was the best host I've ever had at a table. Anything I needed she was there and on point. We had another girl there too but I cant remember her name. She was just as great and helpful. They made sure my boyfriend always had a drink in his hand. Oh and! we also had security at our table so randoms couldn't linger up in there. \n\nNeedless to say the night was awesome! I felt really well treated, the music was bumpin and my boyfriend had a GREAT time....success. I don't know why I don't do this every weekend?? It made me want to get a table every time I go there. \n\nThanks Firehouse!"
1,"This place is the epitome of diamond in the rough. Back in my underage days, a few girlfriends and myself ventured to our friendly neighbor to the north for spring break (we couldn't afford sun) and made it to the city of Montreal. We met a local on the Metro and he gave us the suggestion to hit Bifteck.\n\nI can safely say, we had one of the most fun nights of all time. This bar was amazing for making new friends, Molson Export flowed like water, and the drink specials were unreal. I'm not sure how they are now, but screw it, they have free popcorn and plenty of TV's. They had these 5 for $5 shot specials going on with risque names for the shots, which only got funnier the more you drank them.\n\nAlso, to all the womenfolk, this bar for some reason attracts the best looking men. This bar was SO much fun, that the next night we went out dancing, and all we wanted to do was go back to Bifteck for more drink specials, friendly great looking people and awesome bartenders.  This is a bar that I will never forget and fully intend to revisit each time I travel back to Quebec."
0,"I hope there was something less than a 1 star rating.\n\nWASTE OF MONEY, STAY OUT OF IT......!!!!\n\nwe spend $70 dlls. on hamburgers (5 people), $70 dollars for food for 5 is nothing, specially at Vegas, but when you just throw your money down the drain, to me that's a fortune,\n\neven the $1 cheap Mcdonald's burgers are way better that those served at this location, DRY and COLD buns, flavor-less patty's, COLD onion rings, lousy service, orders taken  wrongly after a 40 mins waiting, no soda refills offered, it took another 20 mins.at the end just to get the tab.............\n\nMY TIP:............$ .000000 of a penny\n\nthe place wasn't even full, so that is not an excuse, it is on a great location on the strip,\ntables and bar to eat ouside but not even that saves the experience.\n\nAGAIN, STAY OUT OF IT......................."
0,"I am a huge steak fan. I love eating it out and I love grilling it at home. however, a general disclaimer, I am not a food snob or overly picky. I have been told by multiple people that I \""had to try Durrants\"". We ordered an old fashioned and oysters to start. (This is the reason i am giving this review two stars instead of one). The oysters Rockefeller were amazing and I highly recommend them! Also, I haven't had a good old fashioned since I moved to Arizona, and the bar tender really knew his bourbon and the drink was outstanding. Then we put our dinner order in.... I got the 18oz ribeye and my uncle got the bone in ribeye. I asked for Mac and cheese instead of soup and the same for a side. I was instead served clam chowder. My uncle is a huge chowder fan and was excited to try it. I let the slip up go and decided to go with it as well. It was like a bowl of salt with some clam on top. Our waiter noticed we didn't eat any of the chowder and we said politely it was salty, and nothing was done about it. Next the steak came out. We both asked for mid rare. My uncle was rare, mine was medium. Also, I am a salt-aholic. I am that guy who will eat steak with a salt shaker in my left hand to make sure every bite gets a portion. The steak came out to the table overly salty to my taste. Also, the cut of meat was flabby (not marbled as it should be, I understand it is supposed to be fatty, that's why I love ribeye). This was fatty in the \""I bought the cheap one at Wal-Mart kinda way. For a 166 dollar bill, I will not be back."

1,"I was in Phoenix with colleagues from the UK for a trade show so on the last night we decided to go and find somewhere to eat. This place was recommended by the hotel - a concept that fills me with dread but on this occasion I decided not to be a sour puss and go with the recommendation. \n\nIt's got kind of a rustic upscale look about it and a nice ambience, a good mix of people from young couples through to families.\n\nWe had one of their freshly baked baguettes as a starter of sorts which I have to say was really very good, it was served with olive oil but could have done with a touch of balsamic vinegar.\n\nI can't remember what my colleagues had but they didn't complain about it and they do tend to be picky eaters. I had the port chop which was seasoned perfectly and cooked just the way I like it - well done. Maybe it's a UK thing but the thought of pork not being nuked and served medium makes me gag. It was served with stewed peaches and a potato salad - perfect.\n\nOur server Greg was very attentive without being totally in your face. The place is about a 10 minute cab ride from downtown but well worth it. The hotel billed it as a Californian eatery but it was more like a modern American restaurant.\n\nIn short, highly recommended."
0,Well I booked my trip in December and it was a huge hassle. After being told that they had no availability on any Friday in the months of March or April- I had to negotiate and buy an extra night (on a Monday-how does that make sense) in order to get the room on Friday too! Then just to be safe I called today to confirm they had me for a two bedroom. Turns out our reservation agent made a mistake and only booked a one bedroom. Everyone is already to go we leave tomorrow but now they will call me back in 2-3 hours to let me know what they can do. Well I can certainly say that if this isn't fixed the presentation will be a waste because this would ruin our vacation! Be careful dealing with this groups they over promise!
1,"Love this place! If you like the idea of mongolian BBQ grill like YC's, then you'll definitely love this place. I love that you can pick what kind of sauce you like, your veggies, and either noodle or rice, and they do the rest! They make sure your food is yummy! They also have a regular menu as well which is also delicious...Definitely inexpensive for the amount of food you get!"
1,"The Westin  convention Center is located downtown of Pittsburgh. I reserved a city sky view room on the 18th Floor with twin beds. I got a perfect beautiful view of the city from my windows. The room was clean with a large LCD TV, but the sink is inside the bathroom. If someone inside the bathroom, I can't brush or wash my face. I hardly got any sleep at night from the loud clinking plumbing sound from the next door usage of the bathroom. addional indoor Parking cost $19"

0,This place has gone way downhill.  The sushi smelled terrible.  No wonder it is empty in here now.
0,"I was told 4 days before my move that there might be an issue. This was one day before I was to leave town to get my things. I wish I had been given a week, then I could have found someone else and not have been freaking out on Sunday morning. \n\nThe text said \""Let me see what I can do.\""  It did not say, \""I cannot do your move please find someone else.\"" If he had called me and said he wouldn't be able to do the move, that might have shown some professionalism. But the facts are he did not. \n\nThanks for taking some ownership of the poor customer service I received in your reply, but it really isn't enough."
0,"Guess it's time to train me a new Jack in the Box crew.\n\nOn relocating from San Diego, corporate headquarters of Jack in the Box, to Tempe, I finally had the urge to try the neighborhood Jack.\n\nI order the same thing every time I go to Jack in the Box...big cheeseburger, add pickles, add onions, add tomato, extra pickle, extra onion, extra tomato.  If I order at the drive-thru, I am asked if the order on the screen is correct...and I drive forward.  \n\nBecause the company does not start cooking until an order is made, I am OK with a bit longer wait for delivery.  The strange thing here is that the base price of a big cheeseburger is 40 cents more than in California.  Additionally, I was charged 30 cents (15 cents to add and 15 cents for extra) for tomato.  \n\nI get that some produce is a bit more expensive and I am OK with paying an upcharge...but if you are going to charge me, make sure I receive what I paid for.  On being delivered my sandwich, I unwrapped and lifted the top bun.  Plenty of pickle and onion and a burger that is seriously hot.  In asking the drive-thru person where the tomato is, she told me it was under the burger.  Putting the top bun back on and flipping it over, there is no tomato under the meat.\n\nShe apologized and walked to the grill area.  Once there, she picked up 2 slices of tomato and brought them to the window.  She had not put on gloves, she had not washed her hands and she offered me the tomato slices.  \""Honey, your hands have been on the register and taking money from people.  I'm not going to take any unwrapped food item from you.\""  I asked for a refund of the 30 cents.  While she processed the refund, I wrapped the burger up.  She handed me change and I headed home.\n\nOn arriving home, I ate and called the Jack line, I was advised this location is a franchise-owned store.  The Customer Relations person advised they would let the franchisee know of my concerns.\n\nOh, regrets...Oh, I have many regrets..."
1,"I first ate here two years ago and thought it was very good.  I love the Sushi Roku's in Santa Monica, Hollywood and Pasadena.  My recent lunch there surpassed all of these and any expectations from my first visit in 2010.  \n\nHere's what I ate, all prepared by a young sushi chef named Moon, who is in my book a rising sushi star:\n\nUni sushi - this was two pieces of uni of the highest quality, sweet and unctuous, simply perfect\n\nSpicy scallop hand roll - sweet and fresh scallops, so fresh they were almost a bit crunchy when bitten into, and the sauce was subtly spicy, but not overly hot.  The nori they use here is of the best quality - it crackles when you bite into it, but does not shatter.\n\nEel and avocado hand roll - \u00dcber-rich, sweet and addictive.  The avocado was at its peak of ripeness, the eel sweet and almost melting, and the sauce, which Moon told me was cooked down from sea eel, lent a sweet and an umami flavor to this wonderful roll.\n\nBaked crab hand roll - My favorite dish of the day.  Beautiful crab (it tasted like Alaskan king, but not sure), baked with garlic butter and wrapped in soy paper.  If you love crab, you MUST order this.  I need to have it again.  So good.\n\nService was great, I  enjoyed speaking with Moon about all kinds of food topics, and the sushi bar is a pleasant place to while away a midday hour.  I went on a slow Sunday afternoon and am so glad that I did.  It can be quite a scene on weekend evenings (lots of pretty blonde women in tiny black dresses), but come for the food, too!\n\nHighly recommended."
0,Was there on friday night and the food was below average. You could see only oil in the paneer and shrimp. Ginger mojito was not well made. The person who served us seemed to be in a hurry. Would never come back. Wonder why it is 4 starred on YELP.
0,"In November of 2012 I had a pea sized spot on my underarm that didn't look right, so my PCP referred me to Woodson Dermotology.  \n\nI saw the PA, John.  I made a 7:15am appointment and was seen immediately, literally no wait.  He was VERY nice and examined the spot and informed me that it was ringworm.  I was surprised, as I had ringworm a number of years ago.  But I trusted him and took the pills and cream I was prescribed.  I had a follow-up appoint the next month, and explained to him that it's only getting bigger (MUCH bigger) and didn't look or feel like ringworm.  It was not itchy, did not spread, not scaly, and didn't seem to be contagious.  He reassured me that it \""just presents differently in the armpit\"" I was frustrated but took the new pills and creams I was given.  Again, nothing happened except it was getting BIGGER.  I again had a follow up the next month and expressed my concerns AGAIN.  Nothing, just more creams and pills. This went on and on every month until JULY!!!  For 8 freaking months this man told me I had ringworm... ringworm that was not contagious, not itchy, and didn't even resemble ringworm, and NO drugs he gave me had ANY EFFECT WHATS SO EVER.  To me, that would be a red flag that maybe, just maybe I got this diagnosis wrong, but he refused that he could be wrong.  Upon googling it, I read that even UNTREATED ringworm lasts a maximum of 4 months.  \n\nI would much rather hear \""I'm not really sure what this is! Let's do a biopsy, or call in Dr. whoever to get another opinion\""  rather than swear you're right when you know you're wrong.  But he is too proud to do that.  \n\n In July I went in and there was a PA fresh out of school that John was training.  This PA took ONE look at my \""ringworm\"" and said there's no way that's ringworm!!!  He said it looked like Granuloma Annulare.  He said he would talk to John and come back in.  All of a sudden John thinks it's this now.  But just to be sure, he gives me yet another cream.  I recognized the name of the cream, so I told him, \""I think you have given me this before\"" he said \""hmmm, let me look.... No, we haven't given you any creams before\""  I was flabbergasted!  I have had a minimum of 5 creams prescribed to me.  I bit my tongue just wanting this appointment to be over.  He said if this cream didn't fix it they would do a biopsy (why he didn't do that 8 freaking MONTHS ago is beyond me!) so I get home and find the exact same cream that did nothing 3 months before when he prescribed it to me the first time!  I was furious!  I just kept telling myself, \""just get the biopsy and you will never have to go here again!\""  So of course nothing changed except it got bigger (about the size of a half dollar now, very visible as it is growing beyond my armpit and onto my arm and looks like a huge human bite mark) and another one growing next to it.  So he decided to do the punch biopsy. \n\n At this appointment as well as all the other appointments they asked what I am allergic to.  I read off the list, among them is polysporin.  The assistant was very nice and when she was done she grabbed a Q-tip with a cream on it.  She got about an inch away and I said \""what is that?\""  she said \""polysporin\""  I quickly yell \""I'm allergic to that!\"" before she can get any on me.  Why do you even ask what I am allergic to?  Seriously!  I was supposed to come back 2 weeks later to get the results and get my stitches out. \n\n So 2 weeks later I come back to get my Biopsy results and stitches removed. She took out my stitches and started to leave.  I said \""Excuse me, do you have my biopsy results?\"" she said \""No\"" and started to walk again.  I said \""Are you sure, it's been 2 weeks\"" She sighed and actually opened my file this time (imagine that!) and said \""oh yeah, here it is, it's benign\""  I said \""ok, but is it the granuloma annulare?\"" she said \""yes, that was positive\""  I said \""ok, can you tell me what that is or anything about it?\""  She said she wasn't familiar with it.  OK...... \""can I talk to John or anyone else that does know?\""  She said \""no, they're all busy, but you can make another appointment in a few weeks to talk to him if you have questions\"" I was done, didn't give an answer just stormed out, said goodbye and thank you to the only person worth a crap there (the front office) and went home. \n\n Why would you have someone give you biopsy results and not tell you anything about it?!?  I have wasted almost a YEAR of my life and missing work to go to these appointments every month, because John was too proud to admit he was wrong.  I would love to thank the new guy that diagnosed me at first sight, but never saw him again.  Please don't waste your time here!  If you get a super early appointment there is no wait, John is VERY nice, however none of that matters if you can't get treated for what it actually wrong."
0,"We were looking for good ole pub food and excited when we saw Todd English P.U.B.  This place is great for beers but food - the quality does not justify the price.\n\nDirty Chicken : way too salty\nLobster Roll: you would imagine that it would be a freshly baked roll.\n\nThe only good dish was the Shepherd's Pie.\n\nHowever, not enough for me to want to go back.  In fact, we didn't finish most of the dishes."
1,"Food is always delicious. Get the eggplant di amore and you won't be disappointed! There is plenty to share with enough to take more home.\n\nAmbiance is spectacular. It's always noisy and fun. There is a nightly house band that plays anything from Sinatra to Fats Domino- so much fun!!! \n\nYou will likely wait, even if you have a reservation. Just knock the chip off your shoulder and enjoy. It can be about 45 minutes because the place is packed and no one wants to leave their table.\n\nI've never had a good experience with the limo service. You will probably wait about 1 hour for your return ride, so be sure to request the limo long before you order dessert or request the check. The limos are old and the driver doesn't adjust heat or AC so you'll probably be uncomfortable."
1,"Couldn't be better. Mine was a simple job, handled by Brandon (Barry? Sorry, whoever's from Brooklyn) in a few minutes...they'll now do all the work on our car. Oh, and ours is not an import. They're professional and courteous...and they get the job done right. Thanks guys..."

0,"I'd love to give this place a higher rating BUT I never even got the chance to try a cupcake. \nAfter circling the block for about 10 minutes because not being from the area the bakery is not well marked. \nThat wasn't the issue. \nSo, the bakery was pretty full of people waiting for some other flavors to be brought out. I was one of them too. \n10-15 minutes later.........I was ignored by not one, not two, but three of the employees. I was standing in line just like the other customers but was overlooked by three people. \nI have not decided if I would even attempt to go back because of this experience."
1,i had a quick breakfast here before i left Las Vegas. I ordered the {EGG WHITE FRITTA W/ SIDE OF BACON} the fritta was good and healthy! (the bacon probably not as much so! :) but good. I also ordered the {WATERMELON JUICE} which i was a big big fan of. Just thinking about it make me wish I was there.
1,I really had a relaxing experience there.\nThe receptionists and therapists are very friendly. They really did a good job massaging me. $30 for one hour from head to toe is an great price.\nI still come back once or twice a month.
1,"I first had Samba in 2005. My husband and I eat here almost every trip to Las Vegas. I have had family members order off the menu and they enjoyed their meals, but rodizio Is the way to go here. You start with a salad and bread. Then they bring out your side items: glazed carrots, plantains, creamed spinach, rice and beans. I love the carrots and plantains. The typical meat offerings are sausages, chicken wings, bacon-wrapped turkey, sirloin steak, flank steak, lamb, teriyaki chicken, pork and pineapple. The pork and pineapple is my favorite part. The pineapple is honey glazed before they cook it and it is fantastic! Definitely the highlight. They also have garlic bread and vegetables now. It is pricey at about $35 per person but go hungry because it is worth it."
0,"They were sent out by my home warranty.  If I could give them less that one star, I would.  Unfriendly, slow, showed up 45 minutes after the appointment window (after I had told them I would have to take an afternoon off so I could be there in the window they stated), and the technician did not identify himself when he came to my house, I had to ask who he was and why he was here...  I do not understand how a business like the still keeps the doors open.  If I ever have appliance issues again, I will request my home warranty send anyone but this company.   Truly a horrible experience!"
1,"'Which buffets should I go to while visiting the Las Vegas strip?'  It's the question that haunts all of us and never seems to escape our nightmares.  Well one of the answers for me is the MGM buffet.  I have heard the Bellagio, Aladdin, and Rio are the best, but you will be paying more there.  I have been to several other buffets on the strip and the MGM has been my favorite because of the value.  Our waiter was a little slow to clear our plates and refill our drinks, but he was very friendly and it was extremely busy.  They have some of everything, which I guess would be expected at any decent buffet, but these guys seem to have it all.  Best chile relleno I've ever had in my life, really good cr\u00e8me brulee, and many types of cheesecakes among an incredible dessert selection.  For breakfast they do made-to-order omelettes, and at night cooked-to-order steak.  For dinner they Alaskan King Crab Legs, and the list could go on forever of course, but I sure did feel like I was at Disneyland when I noticed the stack of Cracker Jacks!  That made it really special for me.  Check their website listed here for the hours of lunch and dinner, and a highlight of the menu.\n\nTip 1: Using a duffel bag as seen in the movie Vegas Vacation  is not permitted at this buffet.\nTip 2: Make it for lunch (until 2:30) and it's $10 cheaper ($20 for lunch, $30 for dinner)"
1,Good. .But not great tapas.   Would give 3.5 stars. .. But rounding up due to the solid service we got at the bar on a crowded night.
0,"What a disappointment. This place was recommended by friends and Yelpers alike, but I don't have a nice thing to say about it, so perhaps something has changed?\n\nI had my usual eggs florentine, my french partner a 'complete' crepe. My poached eggs were cooked to oblivion rather than having the runny yolks they should have, and the hollandaise sauce tasted suspect. The crepe had the texture of cardboard (not made with good butter we think), the cheese was not melted, the eggs were overcooked again.\n\nAdded to all this, the coffee is awful, watery stuff.\n\nThe best I can say about this place is it's cheap. But try it at your peril- there are so many nicer places around."
0,"I have been using this store for some time now and noticed the manager was always in a bad mood. As each time passed it just seemed odd the mood was always the same. Well this last time I spoke with Ted (manager) he tried to upsell items I didn't need. In asking questions as to why I would need them it aggravated him to explain. So much so that he got argumentative, my assumption is I didn't say \""yes\"" to all the unnecessary items. I come to find out there is another store on 32nd st and Camelback, not far, that is great. Customers come first and when it becomes a problem just to do simple tasks I'd rather go elsewhere. Save yourself time and aggravation and use another store, not worth it."
1,"Simply The Best NV Burger. Recomendadissimo, the only problem are the queues, go near closing time rs"
0,"We had great expectations for this restaurant because it looks like a nice place with good atmosphere.  We did the all you can eat and that was a good thing because the portions were teeny tiny for the price they were asking for each item.  \n\nFirst of all, the sushi was incredibly bad.  The rice was very hard and chewy.  I don't know what kind of rice they use but it is definitely not sushi rice.  The amaebi nigiri sushi was ruined because they poured on some vinegary sauce on the shrimp.  This made the sushi sour and it made it fall apart.  The maguro was not cut in the right direction so it seems the sushi chefs do not know how to slice fish.  \n\nThe cooked items were better than the sushi except for the very small portions.  We had the Kalbi, bulgogi and shrimp tempura.  The shrimp tempura was terrible.  It was soggy and oily.  Very sad.   Needless to say, we will not be returning to this restaurant."
1,"We were in downtown Chandler for lunch and decided to walk over here for dessert. I had the nuez and it was delicious. I also got the hibiscus and lemon drink for my drive home and it was so refreshing, especially since it hit 100 degrees today. I would highly recommend this place, plus you don't have to feel guilty because everything is all made fresh there."
1,"Hibachi is normally related to Japanese name. however, I notice all the Asian worker speak Northern CHINESE. \n\nThe place is very  clean - as expected - it is a new.\n\nthe food: good selection, good salad bar, very reasonable price, fresh. it taste approximately equal to other Asian buffet. All good."
1,"The line was very long but it was worth the wait. The service was good too. Our waiter was helpful and fast. \nLove the restaurant's entrance with fire inside the glass. We had to take a picture in front of it. \nThe food was great, my favorite were the Truffle Parmesan Fries and I highly recommend them. We first started with the Jalape\u00f1o Popper Shots. I love spicy food but I don't know if it was cause I was drinking on a empty stomach or my Acid Reflux; but they were very spicy and gave me heartburn. I did enjoy the ranch sauce that you dip the poppers in, it was very yummy, refreshing, and helped with the heat of the popper. Next we got ours Burgers and the Truffle Parmesan Fries. The fries were so delicious. I love Parmesan cheeses and these fries were top with lots of it. I order the American Burger. It was very good but I wanted well done. Still good and juicy. \nOverall I would highly recommend trying Gordon Ramsay BurGR and I will be coming back when I'm in Las Vegas."
0,"I hadn't brought anything to Apollo Cleaners for a long time, and now I remember why.   I brought in a wool blanket and the person I gave it to, wasn't sure they could clean it.  She told me they would call and let me know.   Weeks went by, they never called so I stopped by.  They gave it back to me on a hanger and wanted $18.    They may have pressed it, but it was hardly cleaned and THEY NEVER CALLED.\n\nIf you need cleaning, find another cleaner.   Poor customer service, questionable processes."
1,I've been here quite a few times all pre planned to see certain performers.  I must say I do like this place they book good artists it has a good feel to it.  It's not the easiest to get a drink maybe I need to be more aggressive or maybe they need to make away with the stupid under 21 division especially since the 21 under side has a better view of the stage but you can't have a drink on that side. anyway keep on booking good music and i'll keep coming
1,"Best sushi ever.  Also most expensive sushi bill ever.  If you have the money, eat your heart out here...it's definitely worth it!  I sat at the bar and the chef I talked to was Japanese and lived in another part of Japan that I worked in too (similar situation as at Taka Sushi) and was super friendly.  I think I sat eating here non-stop for 3 hours haha."
1,"Forgive the dramatics, but Copper is my favorite Indian restaurant...in the world!  And check out my other reviews, I  eat a lot of Indian.  The saddest part is that I no longer live in Charlotte but eat there whenever I visit.  Favorite dishes includes shrimp vindaloo, chicken tikka masala and lamb ghost.  Great ambience in a Victorian cottage and the service is consistently friendly.  Their menu has changed a bit but they will special order if you ask.  Copper is a rare treat in a town that could use more high quality ethnic cuisine."
1,"Been here about five times now since it opened; and it's still an awesome club to visit.\n\nThe cabana tables we had a while ago were beautiful; you're provided with your own private area with a hot tub in the front, a few tables inside, a bartender, host, and your own bottles. That was a really fun experience, and definitely worth the price if you can garner up a good group that's willing to pay for it!\n\nThe entire place is huge and once in; the first thing that strikes you is the scenic pool setting. It's a great place to come during the summer nights (same rules as XS, don't jump in the pool!) and the drinks are quite awesome.\n\nDefinitely not as packed and marketed as XS, Marquee, or the like; which for my group of buddies, is good! No lines, no hassle, and still an awesome atmosphere. \n\nCover varies, once we paid $50, another $20 depending on what's going on."
1,They're all very nice and welcoming. I've gotten a pedi here twice and loved it! My new favorite spot. Lindas awesome! :)
0,"Long wait, food was weak. Even Ray Charles could see this meal was a fail."
1,Finally had a chance to order off of their full menu. They were at the Miller Market one Thursday and my bf and I stopped by for dinner. I had the Moki with no tomatoes and my bf had the Oliver (I think) and we shared some fried pickles. We both really liked what we had and I look forward to seeing them more around my side of town!
1,"i've gone here three times since it first opened, and it is now my go-to place for a california burrito while in pittsburgh.\n\nsummary:\n1. tacos are OK. i wouldn't go out of my way to grab the tacos here. \n2. california burritos and other burritos are packed with meat. while the guacamole may be mixed with some type of sour cream to help keep costs low, i don't mind TOO much. \n3. they have the red and green sauces. green seems to provide more of a kick than the red sauces, but either way, they're both not very spicy.\n4. their carne asada fries are not as messy (read: unhealthy) as the carne asada fries seem back home. that said, they're not completely smothered in toppings, which some people may find more manageable.\n\ni'll definitely be back, as I've bought this yelp deal, and I have to use it!"
1,"This place saved the day recently when we needed really, really big trash bags. None of the big boxes had them big enough (Home Depot, Lowes, etc.) and the event was hours away. \n\nWith a Hail Mary phone call, Maintenancemart saved the day! Not only did they have bags the size we needed, the guy encouraged me to bring in one of my receptacles to test it right there in the store, rather than take any chances. Fortunately, the bag fit. After ringing me up, he even carried the box out to my car for me! The customer service was top notch!\n\nOther cool things:\nthey have pretty much every cleaning supply you could imagine -- including those super-cool vacuum cleaners you wear like a jet-pack!\nthere is an enormous plant growing into the rafters -- they'll let you take a snippet if you want to test your green thumb at home.\n\nHelpful tip: the parking lot is NOT the first one you see when traveling south on 7th Ave. turn into the drive right after that...  :)"
1,"MGM. A grandiose hotel with an endless amount of restaurants to choose from. \nFrom Wolfgang Puck, Tom Colicchio, Japanese, high end to a food court with a McD's.\n\nWe settled at Wolfgang to kickstart our first lunch of the weekend. \nI had the manila claim linguini with garlic white wine sauce. Light sauce, amazing flavor, no heavy cream added and the clams were abundant! I liked that. Craving this now."
0,Service was less than great.  GM Mark not receptive to comments or constructive criticism. To tell you he heard the same thing before but no change made to menu or waitress serving what you ordered correcting the errors in the printed menu is unacceptable.  The ahi tuna taco appetizer was amazing. The tortilla soup was just mediocre. The menu item stating it was chicken stuffed with shrimp and spinach only to be served between two dried out cutlets with a sauce and three shrimp and spinach in between these cutlets does not constitute stuffed by any means.  Go now because if things don't change this place won't make it for too long inSummerlin.
0,"Ric's \""where's the smoke\"" Smokehouse BBQ & Grill needs to rethink their restaurant strategy quickly or they will find themselves closing faster than what it took them to open....\n\nI reeeaaalllyyyy wanted to like this place!  I'm a huge fan of BBQ and a fan of small business owners.  They are somewhat handicapped with a location that has gobbled up prior restaurants that closed almost as fast as they opened, never to be heard from again....  But it was their choice to open a Restaurant in this spot.\n\n\""Where's the smoke\""?  One of the first things you will notice about Ric's Smokehouse when you enter is there isn't any wonderful aromas of cooked BBQ, smoked or otherwise.  There is no BBQ aroma, What the heck?  You should always smell some kind of aromatic BBQ goodness when you enter a BBQ, especially when the word \""smoke\"" is in their name!\n\nAfter a completely disastrous first visit with horrible food and poor service I held back on writing my Yelp review to give this new business an opportunity to work through the kinks. I shared my concerns about their food with the people at Ric's in hopes they would consider making some changes that would help them.  \n\nNow that I have been back twice since my first visit and the issues I pointed out during my first visit still exist.  I don't feel so bad at all in letting my Yelp friends know that Eek! Methinks not! when it comes to choosing Ric's Smokehouse BBQ & Grill as a BBQ place to eat at.\n\nFood ~ they offer four to five different selections of BBQ sauce, which two of them are really good.  Pork sandwich comes with one side at $7.99 when other BBQ places give you two sides for the same price.  The pork on all three visits was over cooked with no smoke rings.  When pork is over cooked the ends of the pork become very dry, hard and chewy.  It taste a little like pork jerky.  Now they keep their pork in an au jus but it still over cooked and the au jus just soaks into the bun and does not keep the pork moist.  The bun they use is very tasty and they toast it.  The sides ~ not so good...\n\nThe brisket was pretty good however they sever it with the fat still on it.  Some fat might be ok but when the fat is 1/4 of the portion of meat your getting it's not so good.  Again it too is missing the aroma of BBQ  and a smoke ring.  The first potato salad was disgusting since they used frozen potatoes, however during my last visit the potato salad wasn't much better.  The mac-y-cheese and baked beans were huge flops with little to no flavor.  Most of their food is supposed to come with either a cheese biscuit or cornbread.  They keep forgetting to give that to their customers and when you ask for it, they give it to you cold, blah...\n\nI'm not going to elaborate on the service since this review is already way too long.\n\nThis owner needs to rethink their business strategy and get some culinary help and advise quickly!  Buy a smoker maybe?  \n\nTheir are other BBQ options in and around the Phoenix metro ~ all of them are much better than this place unfortunately."
1,"This is one of those places that you should go to at least once in your life, especially if you're a vegas local. You owe it to yourself to experience this old vegas landmark. You'll likely be in the company of some Old Vegas Money sitting nearby...peering at you curiously. Regardless, its a cool experience with waiters dressed in tuxes and spouting cheesy jokes and factoids for first time diners. The interior is well maintained with classy paintings and red leather upholstered booths that make you feel like you are breaking bread with the rat pack. If you like atmosphere the way I do, you'll feel right at home.\n\nThe bread wasn't bad, but nothing particularly memorable.\nThe steaks arrived at a reasonable time-- we didn't really wait that long. The steak itself was perfect-- definitely one of the ten best steaks I've ever tasted in my lifetime. I'm not sure if it was the best outright, or if it was considerably better than the one I had at Hank's steak and martini. It was a ribeye cooked medium rare--just the way any real steak eater likes em. My girlfriend had the prime rib which came with some pretty tasty horseradish and cream dip. We ordered steak fries as our solitary side. I had no problem finishing my rib eye and sampled some of my girlfriends cut, which was perfectly cooked as well. I can't comment much on the sides, other than to say that the fries we ordered were tasty but hardly better than the fat fries you can get at your local Fatburger. From what I've been told, the sides are good but not stellar at this joint. If i return in the future I'll be better able to assess the experience but from what I saw, it was an enjoyable night with good, expensive food."
1,"It's pricey, but it is worth it. This is easily the best place to eat in South Park. It gets a little too hipster at times, but the sushi is outlandishly creative and delectable and the burgers are manly, monstrous, and cooked like nobody's business and the beer selection is a cornucopia of mind-shattering awesomeness.\n\nWant to try a bison sushi roll created by Ric Flair? Cowfish has got you covered. If you're not interested in that, you may want to check your pulse.\n\nAgain, be prepared to pay and be surrounded by snooty, hip, white people. The \""experience\"" doesn't do it for me, but the downright artistry of the delicious food more than compensates for the other customers."
1,"I got really lost looking for this place! Directionally challenged I know. But my excuse is that I'm an international traveler in your fine city!\n\nAnyway, I was starving and was determined to find this joint after reading all these great reviews. I had the 1/4 chicken leg combo, which was translated to me by a really nice couple (the menu is in French FYI). I watched in amazement as the cook chopped up the meat and piled it with a TON of fries!!! The meal could easily feed a family of four! It also comes with rice and a salad. But honestly you can't see what's underneath the giant pile of fries!\n\nThe chicken had a lovely taste to it. The spicy sauce wasn't as spicy as I'd like it to be. And everything was a teensy bit too salty. If I had a friend to share it with, it would have been more manageable!  All in all a great neighborhood restaurant. Seems to be hugely popular with the locals. The line was almost out the door!"
0,"This was okay, but I've definitely had better!"
0,"Once again not nuts about this place.  Food seems to have lost its flavor, the front counter folks could put a smile or two on their faces.  I cant stand when someone hates their job and you can tell!"
0,"I moved into this apartment complex a little over 2 months ago. It is a brand new complex and has many common amenities. It is situated on the border of Scottsdale and Paradise Valley. \n\nI am giving it 2 stars for the below unbiased reasons:\n\n1) Every unit has a built in fan in the bathroom that cannot ever be turned off. The fan runs 24/7 and flashes a green light. While some may not find it to be a big disturbance, I personally find it difficult to sleep well with the fan perpetually on without wearing earplugs. Broadstone Alliance has turned it on so that it can pursue Leed certification. (Leed certification can lead to tax savings for corporations). The manager claims it benefits tenants due to the constant clean air, you can be the judge. \n\n2) You can hear noise in hallways vividly. While noise insulation between units appears decent, because there is a slit under unit doors, if you are unfortunate to have neighbors who will speak loudly in the hallways and odd hours, it is audible. \n \n3) Apartments monthly rent can be for example $1299 for a studio, $1500+ for a 1bdrm and you must have renter's insurance. (keep in mind the area, this is not NYC)\n\n4) If you want to break the lease the manager has stated that it will be 2 months rent plus any incentives you received at lease signing. Apply that to the sample apartment rents.  $2600 and $3000+. I was not offered any negation room to break the lease.  \n\nIt is up to you to decide whether it is worth the price. At such high prices I would expect the corporation to have enough decency to leave the fan in the bathroom off for the benefit of it's occupants sense of calm and quiet and treat tenants with more understanding when people are uncomfortable and require lease breaks."
1,Especially love just do it!  Same Time Next Year was fabulous.
1,"I drive all the way to Ahwatukee for this salon. Best manicure/pedicure.\n\n it is insanely clean, everything is new, the chairs are some of the best. they don't vibrate- they actually massage into your shoulders. and they always play kool jazz. it makes me feel like a kid stuck in my step dads car all over again. only...in a good way. ok, so they don't correlate. whatever. \n\ni always nearly pass out, and so does everyone i go with. so relaxing. and you leave feeling like a million bucks. \n\n My only complaint is they speak vietnamese in front of clients and I think that's tacky...but it's pretty hard to escape at most salons"
1,"This is the only Whole Foods i have been to , so i will have to check out some others as well.This one is quite close to my house is i like it.   They have wonderful selections on everything. Fruits, veg, meat, seafood.                                                    They even have clothing, shoes and purfume.  Vitamin selection is out the roof!         So much to choose from. The one draw back,very high prices.                                      Though they will give you $$$of your bill , if you bring in your own bags.                      When you want to to treat yourself to a great shopping experiance this is place.             I feel that you will really enjoy it!"
0,Pork egg rolls have about as much pork as the vegetable spring rolls...not much.  Nothing like the advertisement.
0,"Ate there with the wife last night. Everything tasted to us like it was straight out of a can and came to the table cold. Server was nice, but the everything home made speech is a crock. Just because it was put in a pot, then from a pot to a plate does not mean it should be called homemade or hand made."
0,I love Hampton Inn but this location is in serious need of remodeling and some deep cleaning. Musty smell everywhere.
0,"We went here on our way back to our Condo, wanted a quick snack before bed (considering it was already a late night). We look around, see this small cafeteria like deli, thought, that place MUST be reasonable. We sit down and order a \""simple\"" pastrami sandwich, cheeseburger. Then we asked if it came with fries, she said separate - she wasn't kidding a small plate for 10.99 -- yikes! \nPastrami was a pound of meat between two slices of bread, cheeseburger - very bland, and the fries look the same as Jack In The Boxe's curly fries. \nNot impressed -- what was the kicker is the $45 bill for those three items.\n\nI would not recommend this for a quick snack, I could have taken a cab and ate for that price."
0,"Sad to say that the Marie Callender's restaurants of yesteryear fame, fine food and delicious pies, are a thing of the past. We have long since given up ordering meals here after a we had 2 chicken pies with nothing but gravy and only a few peas, one carrot with two mini bites of chicken in them. Recently however, after a dinner we drove across town with some friends so that we could enjoy a dessert of their fresh peach pie. We were happy to see that they had a whole peach pie in the bakery area as we entered. \n\nWhat transpired after we we were seated and placed our order, most certainly helps to explain why these restaurants are closing. The waitress returned and said that they were out of peach pie. When we mentioned that there was one in the bakery cabinet she stated that they could not cut into those pies to serve in the restaurant. We then said that we would buy the whole pie in the cabinet and asked if they could give us some plates. \n\nThe answer was an abrupt no. Customers are not allowed to buy a whole pies and eat it in the restaurant. Further, the waitress went on to say that they never cut their fruit pies in slices to serve in the restaurant because to is too hard for them to cut the slices, therefore they just cut a slice of pie crust and slop the fruit on top. \n\nNeedless to say we did not get peach pie and left."
1,Service n decor is outstanding! Old school vibe. Great place for friends from out of town. The name throws u off?? Sounds like a biker bar. All other reviews are on point. Have you ever  had bad garlic bread? It's a no brainier. So if your driving in from California exit early at south point and head north on lv blvd.
1,"Highly recommend the Reuben sandwich, best in town! Wonderful with a frosty pint.\n\nI enjoy the live music during the week, and it's a great place just escape the hectic pace of life."
0,"Unless you're staying here for one quick overnight, don't even bother with this place. Stayed two nights recently and my room stunk of smoke. The AC didn't do anything to help. I called the front desk and told them, and they stated they'd look around and see if someone was smoking in an adjacent room. Next day it smelled the same. \n\nRooms are dark and musty. Carpets need to be replaced. The whole place needed a major redo two years ago."
1,"I first learned of this place by invite. Two of my closest friends suggested Rosita's Place as a place to meet for lunch and since my first visit, I was hooked and with any luck, you might be too."
1,Very friendly staff....food was awesome !!!
0,"I frequent this location often-We usually order online or phone it in and get food to go- and usually pay with a credit/debit card. \nBE AWARE ----my husband gave a five dollar tip (granted, he should have given more, but in his defense it wasn't a big order and it was to-go) and his card was charged with a 40 dollar tip. \nOnly because I was looking over my account regarding another issue did I question the large purchase at BWW. I called and spoke to a manager, and was told it would be looked into. The extra 35 dollars was refunded several days later, but I never received a call back, or any apology of any sort. \nThat is extremely shady- and stealing! To not even get at least an apology is poor business practice."
1,"I eat here every time in in town... The service is hit and miss, but the food is solid for a sports bar. I recommend it to friends on a regular basis. I usually get the Rojo Diablo... It's the best buffalo chicken sandwich I've found."
1,"Most people don't have a good time at this club. I could tell by the line-up of around 800 people on Halloween night. However, for my buddy (who looks just like Ryan Phillipe) and I, it was a seriously slick night. We got in with no waiting in line and didn't pay any cover.\n\nThe inside of Studio 54 is nothing short of completely mindnumbing. The place is huge, offers ridiculous effects and lighting, and provides live entertainment from their excellent line-up of beautiful dancers (both male and female). The drinks here are over-priced, but that's something you have to live with. The place is legendary.\n\nSure, I didn't Mike Meyers there, but the place spanked of taste and the perfect club atmosphere. Even without cocaine, I felt like I was ripped anyways.\n\nStudio 54 is beautiful. It's exclusive. And the whole world wants to be in there."
1,"My original feeling was to give the IP 3 stars - neither here nor there - until I ended up bleeding all over their escalator and floor and their great treatment of dumbass me merited another star.  More on that later.\n\nI was in Vegas for my first time for my first Roller Con, the international roller derby convention.  Yes, that exists.  Naturally, we needed someplace cheap, and IP fit the bill.  They dealt with 1000+ drunk and rowdy rollergirls/crew pretty well; of course some of the security was freaking out, but overall, I've heard few complaints from attendees.  You have to look at the hotel for what it is, guys.  I went over to the Bellagio and hadn't apparently comprehended before the trip that some hotels are palaces; the IP is utilitarian, generic brand. \n\nDo I have complaints?  PLENTY.  The layout of the hotel is unforgivable; nothing connects, some areas are incredibly far from the main part of the hotel and having a room there is like staying in the boonies.  You can't get from one end of the hotel to the other in any simple manner.  You're constantly going up and down elevators and escalators and getting lost.  Speaking of elevators, there need to be at least a dozen more; huge crowds would form around the bank of elevators next to the casino (which, yes, smells like an ashtray, but I'm also from CA where I'm not used to indoor smoking), and one time I waited for at least five minutes before an elevator stopped at my floor to go down.  Prepare to get snuggly with your fellow riders because people WILL pack in.  Friday/Saturday night enormous crowds formed around the elevators, a mix of skanked-out girls and drunken loud derby players, plus some unfortunate families whose children will never recover.  Karaoke bar is ok, I guess, but everything is more fun when you pack a couple hundred rollergirls in.  The pool is far too chlorinated, smelled funny, and hurt my eyes.  You have to pay for wifi.  The self-parking garage is way too small for weekend crowds.  Public restrooms aren't great.  Considering I was there for a convention, I spent a lot of time in the conference rooms, and those were pretty much what you'd expect in a cheap hotel: large rooms with no frills.  I appreciated that every conference room consistently had coolers of ice water and a stack of cups.  Apparently the IP is supposed to be Asian-themed, but they carry through so poorly that it was hardly noticeable.  \n\nDeluxe, no, workable, absolutely.  My friends ended up in a room with a love tub - a big tub IN the room, with a mirror over it and a mirror over the bed.  It was the kind of crap I'd seen on TV and I loved it.  FYI: having all your friends lie on the bed and take pictures in the mirror is fun.  I didn't find the regular rooms, showers, or closets as unsavory as some yelpers have, although I am still unclear why packets of butter were smeared all over my friend's room door/outside wall.  \n\nThey've already been mentioned by others, but: DEALERTAINERS.  I laughed at the billboards on the way into town, but oh man, it is awesome to go into the casino and see someone who vaguely resembles Michael Jackson on the roulette wheel.  Other celebs I saw: Billy Idol, Britney Spears, Stevie Wonder, Madonna, Gwen Stefani, Freddie Mercury (that guy was great), Pat Benetar, etc.  And they take turns getting up on the little platform and lip syncing a song by their likenesses.  So great.  And the Dealertainers POSE if you point a camera at 'em!  LOVE IT.\n\nAs I mentioned in the first sentence of this review, I ate it on an escalator (600% my fault, had nothing to do with the escalator/hotel, no I am not suing) and ended up with a large, deep gash in my knee that left me bleeding everywhere.  As an aside, keep in mind that a friend had stuck a large fake mustache on me immediately before the incident, so I extra looked like a dumb and potentially drunk rollergirl who had been running around for days annoying people.  The cleaning people saw my predicament and said they had to call security, then waited what seemed like a while to give me a paper towel or something, and security and an EMT showed up startlingly fast.  And they were all VERY nice to me.  The EMT cleaned me up and taped gauze on me, the security guard got all my info, they spoke to the lucky friend who got to take me to urgent care - hell, they knew where an urgent care was, not just an ER - and I never got the feeling I was being judged or condescended to.  Even the cleaning people who got stuck cleaning up the blood were nice, and coincidentally, one ended up cleaning the room I'd stayed in and randomly telling my roommate about the accident; my friend said yep, she knew me, and the woman asked my friend to send along a \""hope you're doing ok.\""  THAT'S SERVICE."
0,Ordered the red curry with chicken. Tasted good until I found a roach in it. I will not ever eat there again. Disgusting.
1,"After following them on Instagram for some time, I decided to pop in for lunch with my son and sister. Right when we walked in, we were pleasantly greeted and asked if it was our first time there. We said yes and she asked if we'd like some meat samples. Whaa?! Yes please! She explained what each meat was and what our meal options were. Because of that I ended up ordering two types of meat instead! The flavor for all the meats were so rich and tasty! I ended up choosing the kalua pig and the pulehu steak in a bowl with a bunch of selections from their toppings bar including the yummy seaweed rice. The portion sizes were great and the quality of the food was perfect for their affordable pricing. We also ordered their \""award winning\"" coconut bark and OMG! It's to die for! I'm not the biggest fan of coconut but this stuff is AMAZING! We ended up ordering another box to take home. I ended up meeting the owner as we were leaving and he was so humble and thankful for our service. We'll definitely be coming back!"
1,"Best croissants!!! I always get a plain and a chocolate. They're usually eaten by the end of the 40th st. bridge on the way to work. Authentic and awesome, I can't believe you haven't been over there yet! GO!"
1,Great little gem in downtown Chandler that has quality food and even better beer!  Happy hour is from 2-7 and had great food and drink specials. I will be up on the rooftop patio enjoying the sun next time I go.
0,The juice does not taste like the flavor you get. I got a mango drink and it tasted like plastic. The day before I got a strawberry lemon and they use lime and it's way to much and it's just so sour. The past 2 days the girls have a bad attitude and not friendly at all. It's not even worth the money!!!! I won't go there again!!!
0,"Read all the reviews about fresh ingredients and the pizza so we just got a vedgie pizza delivered. Honestly, I am really diappointed with the quality. Nothing about our pizza was actually fresh, the vedgies (peppers, mushrooms, etc.) were all canned vegetables. We won't be ordering pizza from here again for this reason. Gross. To the owners: don't be cheap with your ingredients or customers will notice and not return."
0,"Had literally the worst service today.  The waitress did not take order until 30 minutes after sitting down, despite many attempts to get attention. Furthermore it took 45 minutes to get the food after we ordered and then they forgot one of the foods so we had to wait more time.  Then they promised free dessert and coffee but once we got the bill, they tried to add it in. Would not recommend as food was sub par."
0,"PROS:\n-Big space, air conditioned, clean.\n-The best dish and only thing worth noting that we had was the lettuce wrapped chicken. \n-Friendly service. \n\nCONS:\n-I had the shrimp in lobster sauce. It essentially tasted like I was eating plastic there was so much corn starch. I couldn't have more than 2 bites before I lost my appetite. \n\n-Not authentic Chinese, FAAARRRRRR from it, but Americanized Chinese is PF Chang's \""thing\"", so if you're into that, this is the place to go. \n\np.s. Tiramisu at a Chinese restaurant...first time I've seen that."
0,"I looked forward to this meal for months but was sadly dissapointed.  I had the posole, the rough cut tuna, and the shrimp tamale.  My wife had the chile relleno.  We found the food to be fairly bland and not mediocre.  The place was beautiful, the beer and service were great, but honestly, I came for a kick-ass meal and this place flopped in that department.   Out of what we had I'd say the tuna was the best...."
0,"Its just ok. Another poorly maintained Summerlin park. Trashy people leaving their dog poop all over, and leaving their trash all over."
1,"Wow, went back again and had the Antipasto salad....whoa! Amazing, the large is enough for 4 adults. Also had the Philly Cheese Steak, man this blows Phillies version out of the water!  I am so impressed. My friends had the hamburgers which were enormous and they said the smoked bacon on them was incredible. So nice to have a somewhat fast food restaurant with real plates and silverware. Very nice touch. Really our only minor complaint would be the napkins, very cheap and you end up using more of them. \nOne other thing that was weird, at least for me was the old man ( I'm guessing the owner ) sitting in a corner just watching everything going on, feels a little mafia like, just weird. At least talk to customers to see if they're enjoying the food. Beyond that, I'm a fan of this place."
0,This place blows. Foods ok but service is terribly slow. Maybe I have just caught them on off days but I will go to Big Heng down the street from now on.
1,"What's unique about Wicked Spoon compared to all other buffets is that they are already pre-plated single servings. You can grab a small basket of chicken, a small plate of salad, a plate of red velvet pancakes with a side of cream cheese syrup...without using serving spoons/tongs/other utensils. They have a nice variety of food. The desserts are pretty especially the macarons...but they're not all as yummy as they look which is the only flaw this place has."
1,"Service was a little slow, but the food was really good. The scalloped potatoes that came with the filet were awesome. Plus the sticky buns were really good.  The view of Camelback Mountain from out table was pretty awesome also."
0,"Dated decor,  servers that never know the specials.. or care.  Food is ok.  Really a bland and boring place to go."
1,"Ahhh! Yuki Shaved Snow. A huge breath of fresh air on a hot, hot, hot day. \n\nAmbiance: 4 - The area was small with with maybe 4-5 small tables with around 7-8 chairs inside. But it's not like it's super busy yet, so you can stay inside and chat about food with your friends! \n\nOn the counter, you can view all the toppings and ice cream from the glass wall that they have set up! \n\nService: 4 - Servers were a little impatient with me trying to decide what I wanted, but they were nice. I asked for time to decide, but she still seemed to be on edge hah! Relaaax! Chill, girl! You work in an ice cream shop! :)\n\nFood: 4 - In this ice cream shop, they serve 3 main things: \n\n(1) Ice cream (cone or cup) \n(2) Shaved Flavored Ice (5 for regular and 6.50 for large) \n\n--The price was pretty worth it for the amount of ice that I got! My favorite flavor is currently honeydew! \n\n(3) Creamy buns: Ice cream (+ 1 topping) that they put inside of a doughnut bun that they (attempt to) heat and seal with (what I think is) doughnut icing. \n\n--I had the creamy bun, it was really, really sweet--so not my style exactly--but it would be really yummy for those sugar lovers! I prefer my doughnuts and ice cream separate! \n\nAnother reason I might not have liked the bun was because it was pretty messy; they put the ice cream in first, then heated it up! They should really lightly warm the doughnut first, and then add the ice cream--just because it was such a hot day and the ice cream melted fast and spilled all over!!! :O \n\nThe entire menu was written on white board, which I hope means: new flavors..?!...Often.?!!! Hopefully! That way we get to taste the real creative side of Yuki! Well, there it is! Try not to get too addicted, Yelpers!"
0,For being in a tourist area no one seems to be very good at customer service. I stood at the bar just to ask a question about if we seat ourselves or wait to be seated. After standing there for 10 minutes no one acknowledge us and I proceed to ask at the bar. The bar tender just stood there and then started helping other people after making eye contact with me several times. \n\nVery bad customer service. Will never go back.
1,"Yes it carries a $59 price tag but it's definitely an experience worth partaking once in Las Vegas. This is not your typical brunch buffet. You can get those at the World of Buffets for unlimited breakfast, lunch and dinner. This is an experience. \n\nIt really breaks down to what do you value for your money. Is it food alone or can ambiance be a deciding factor. For me, it's the whole experience. I enjoy buffets. I enjoy making a reservation. I enjoy being seated on time for my reservation. I enjoy the extra attention from the wait staff. I enjoy the option of ordering off a menu during my buffet. I enjoy live music and great customer service. And finally, I enjoy scrumptious food. \n\nSo why only 4 stars? Not much variety for the buffet. Just Prawns. Large large prawns."
1,"Locally owned, authentic, good prices, big servings. Gyro meat is moist and full of flavor! Veggies are always fresh. Feta is the best! Go to in the Roosevelt Row neighborhood."
0,"The start is for atmosphere, food is awful. No flavor whatsoever. Drinks are over priced . I was expecting a good Margarita for 13 dollars but it was just like the food. No flavor. I will not come back nor recommend anyone ."
0,"I don't get why anyone would call this pizza delicious.  The only thing good about the pepperoni pizza was the pepperoni.  The crust had all the flavor of a paper plate. They put a pinch of cheese on the pie and call it a pizza.  The best description of this pizza, in my opinion, is bland.  Maybe it's because I'm spoiled after having pizza as delicious as Joe's NY Pizza in Old Town, but this pizza is a big yawn.  The venue is great.  They just need a new recipie for pizza."
0,"I was rushed the moment I got in the door. I ordered a BBQ Beef Brisket sandwich, which was good, but the fries which were skinny and crispy had potential, but were cold and overcooked. The waitress definitely wanted to be somewhere else, was not inviting environment, so will definitely shoot for another place next time in Pittsburgh, although the city as a whole is awesome!"
1,LOVE THEIR FOOD.\n\nthe service is great too :)
0,"One of the worst venues to see a concert.\nI guess if you like being in a huge mosh pit, you might like it. After being pushed, shoved and crammed against an industrial sized fan, I had to walk out into the lobby to see/hear the rest of the Lindsey Stirling concert.  The video screens in the lobby were a joke and don't even get me started on the crappy sound system!!\nI guess the only saving grace about this place, the gin & tonic was wonderful...way to go bartenders!! \nI will definitely do more research when buying concert tickets in the future, making sure there is seating.  This standing up for 2-3 hours to see a concert is CRAP!!"
0,"This place does not know what they're doing. The doctor tried about 8 different pairs of contacts on me and never could figure out a new contact prescription for me and just ended up using my old prescription from my previous eye doctor which I could not see clearly out of anymore. Oh and by the way, he would not let me put these contacts in and out of my eyes myself, he insisted on sticking his fingers in my eyes to do it which I was not fond of at all! He told me it was faster if he did it - even if that is true, I do not want anyone's fingers in my eyes! Next, my glasses, a whole other big issue! They tried 3 times on my pair of glasses and still couldn't get them right and I now have a pair of glasses that I can never wear that I payed lots of money for. All this to say, my eyes aren't difficult to figure out - I went to a different eye doctor (Premier EyeCare of Arizona) and that doctor/staff was amazing and got everything right the FIRST TIME. Thanks to Premier EyeCare, they fixed Sonoran Desert's multiple screw ups and I now have glasses AND contacts that I can see clearly out of!"
0,Wow this place has gone down hill. Old smelly rooms. Service is horrible
0,"Oy ve iz mir!\n\nNot to be a kvetch....but I consider myself to be an expert on Jewish delis.  As a New Yorker from a predominantly Jewish area and married to a Jew, I've had more than my fair share of experiences at them.  My husband and I woke up this morning with a burning desire for a good bagel, corned beef on rye, and a knish.  So I schlepped all the way up to the PV Mall to get it.\n\nOk, first of all, the decor is terribly schlocky.  Its kind of like the tourist trap Jewish deli you find in Times Square.  Its like a Disney version of a NY deli.  \n\nI take my number and head over to the cold case to get some drinks....of course they didn't have regular lemon Snapple (and why should they?  Its not like every deli, pizza place, and convenience store in NY carries it....) but they did have Dr. Brown's Cel-Ray which is always a welcome sight.  Another thing they had in the cold case which I found to be odd were jars of Nathan's pickles.  Nathan's, like the hot dog place.  I would imagine a Jewish deli would have Ba Tampte pickles....I didn't even know Nathan's made pickles!  It was a little lame to be honest.\n\nAnyways, I go up to the counter where there doesn't seem to be anyone working.  There was no organization to it.  So I waited.  And waited.  In New York, the deli is a finely tuned machine designed to move people quickly.  Chompie's? Eh, not so much.  When I finally did place my order, the guy who took it had a hard time punching it into the computer and asked me to repeat it several times.  Despite saying I wanted my bagel toasted several times I was given a cold, untoasted bagel.  I waited a little longer for my order to come up and went on my merry way.  \n\nHere is the breakdown of the food we ordered-\n\nMatzoh ball soup- Surprisingly good.  I have never had matzoh ball soup with carrots and celery...so much chazerei!  Just give me the matzoh ball! Although, I will admit, it was solid.  I wouldn't go all the way to Chompie's for it because I know that I can make it better in my own kitchen. \n\nPlain bagel \""toasted\"" with cream cheese- Terrible.  The bottom of the bagel was entirely too thick and was very hard.  They didn't even cut it all the way through, probably because the crust is too thick! \n\nCorned beef on rye- Meh.  The corned beef wasn't very good, it wasn't corned enough.  If they make their own they didn't use a piece of brisket that was fatty enough.  The rye (which was not marble rye...) was lackluster.   It couldn't handle the corned beef, became soggy, and eventually fell apart.  The pickle it came with was the grossest thing I've ever seen.  And it was definitely a kosher dill, even though I asked for a half sour.  The potato salad was actually really good though.\n\nKnish- Terrible.  The knishes in my elementary school cafeteria were better than this.  First of all, the outer crust was way too flimsy.  It should have been much, much, thicker, especially considering the gargantuan size of the knish.  We essentially ate a large plate of mashed potatoes.  The potato inside itself was unremarkable.  Not only do I have this Jewish thing going on but I'm also Irish....I've never met a potato dish I didn't like.  Until today.  I didn't even finish my half of the knish. \n\nNow for the prices.  What's with this meshugas?  $2.29 for a bagel with cream cheese is a tad much.  In NY they run you about $1.35.  The corned beef sandwich was $12.50!  Now, I've paid that much for sandwiches in NY before but you get 2 lbs of meat and several layers of sandwich!  This was not a $12.50 sandwich.  I was also going to get us some whitefish salad to sample but at $15.99/lbs it wasn't happening.  \n\nWhy anyone should schlep all this way, in this heat, schvitzing all over, for this dreck?  I don't know!"
0,"I don't understand the great reviews for this place. I went here on a nice evening and decided to sit outside. The atmosphere outside is alright. Cute little old house set up. Big deal. \nThe service is horrible and our waitress didn't seem to listen at all. We ordered some bruschetta. It was ok at best. We then said we were probably interested in trying the lasagna, but to come back in a few more minutes. We told her we changed our minds on the lasagna and wanted to share a four cheese pizza. About 5 minutes later, we get lasagna. She said sorry it came out so fast and the pizza would be out in 10 minutes. We decided it wasn't such a huge deal and we could take that home. However, it is totally rude for one person to get their food and not the other person. Who does that?? We then get our pizza. \nOn to the awful food. Like I said, the bruschetta was ok. Postinos is 100 times better. The lasagna, we just boxed. My boyfriend ate it the next day and said it was horrible. I make much better at home, and this was some extra special dish they had. The pizza.......oh my. It SERIOUSLY tasted like I took a bunch of cheese and melted it in the microwave. It was some of the worst pizza I have ever had. \nI will never go back. Horrible service and horrible food. I don't get why they have such good reviews. Maybe because it is in downtown and its a cool place to go hang out. Go to Angels Trumpet."
0,"We came back to De La Cruz after wonderful experiences last year...awesome foodie food, creative cocktails and great atmosphere...always came here for dinner after shows at the Arts Center.\n\nHowever, I guess all good things must come to an end.\n\nThe good:\n- service was excellent and friendly\n- decor still great...Tuscan\n\nThe bad...we won't be back:\n- Buffet? Really? I only eat buffet food at weddings and conferences\n- menu online is no longer what they serve..no chef inspired risotto of the day, no herbed rack of lamb, no escargot....what you get is standard uninteresting options...pork chop, steak and mash, etc.\n- the one item that sounded tasty was the Quatro Formaggio Penne...nope...literally a few sprinkles of cheese over penne doused in a thick pesto creme...not good.\n- menus were dirty and crumpled\n- if you did want to go for the buffet, it's backyard BBQ fare...brisket, corn, etc.\n\nReally wish the old owner was still in charge...used to love this place!"
1,"Complimentary bottomless edamame with the meal, which is very nice.  Macadamia nut crusted mahi mahi was good, not especially impressive, but good.  Lobster potstickers and spicy ahi roll were good.  \n\nThe star of the night was the chocolate souffle.  A must have!  The gooey, hot center was perfect."
1,Good butter burger. Their combo salad instead of fries is pretty good too!
0,"Wow how the mighty have fallen!!\n\nThey changed their whole menu...which is a very BAD BAD thing. This place is always busy and typically has a wait to sit. My FIRST inclination that something was wrong was when we walked right in and there were empty tables. We sat down right away.  \n\nSecond warning sign: There were no cupcakes nor cakes in the pastry display fridges [located right when you walk in]. Third warning, new drinks on the first few pages of the menu--which actually did look good, but I should've stopped collaborated and listened at this point.\n\nThere is no more lunch crepes on the menu [that was the best thing going for them in my humble opinion] AND they stop serving breakfast promptly at 11 am [EPIC FAIL].  We came for breakfast, got there at 11:20 am, and had to be even told by the hostess we aren't serving breakfast any more.  Table next to us with 8 people tried to order breakfast too. No dice!  \n\nService was very slow, we weren't even greeted by the waitress for 10 mins, busboy came over to our table who we thought was going to take our drink order...instead he stole our sugar container and ran off placing it on another table. no kidding....\n\nAfter looking at the menu for what seemed like an eternity b/c nothing really jumped out at us we ordered a Chinese Chicken Salad and a Turkey BLT. HOW FREAKING BORING. it was that bad.  Bread on the Turkey BLT was good it was supposed to be served with an herb mayo that I asked for on the side. I got regular mayo and therefore my sandwich was rather dry and very blah.  I upgraded for $2.00 to tater tots [even though on the menu listed under side they are the same price as the fries] and thank God I did b/c that was the best part of my meal.\n\nNow I look at webpages and copy all day long so I find inconsistencies fairly quickly, it's a talent what can I say.  They have a 'late night menu' where if you order chicken and waffles it's $19.95 BUT if you order that same meal during the day the price is $20.95????? hmmmmmm Did they not even proofread this menu before they started???\n\nI also keep a word document on my computer of places to eat and not eat in Vegas b/c so many of my friends come into town it's just easier. This place has moved on that document from to eat to avoid.\n\nboo you guys boo"
0,"I like Zoyo, but I'm not sure I would come here if it weren't for the little girl I babysit who loves their yogurt. Sometimes I just feel like their flavors are too processed, and all of their yogurts regardless of dairy content or flavor have high fructose corn syrup in them. \nIf you do go here, try the cake batter or the oatmeal cookie flavors, with toasted coconut."
1,"Mae, or Mason, however you may know her is badass. My gf and I found her on Groupon, which was a giant risk with (little did we know) beyond amazing results. We've been going to Mae since we moved to Las Vegas in Jan 2013. The best thing about her and her out of this world skill and patience, is her CONSISTENCY. She can and will provide a consistently good cut (and color) of whatever style you request from time to time. Badass skills for such a young age, this girl has a bright ass future."
0,"I just experienced again an issue I have registered several times before with Customer Svc, and never had addressed: a customer for 10 yrs, yet while watching a program on a channel for which I've paid, the program is interrupted by a screen informing me how to purchase that channel. The interruption tonight occurred during a key scene in the long-awaited Downton Abbey 4th Season premiere, and lasted long enough that I never found out what the discussion was about. NO ONE ever even addresses my complaint or inquirey regarding why this happens with various channels, all channels for which I've been paying many years. I've asked if it has to do with the cable box, but still no response. Add this to the similar complaints lodged by others about the overcharging, the fact that they allow contracted field cable svc workers to help neighbors/their friends access svcs for free in my apt complex, while I pay for those svcs, and it adds up to a real problem at times. I have found the internet svc to be pretty reliable, but no one answers my questions about why I am charged for the highest level speed of internet when I've requested information about purchasing the slower rates, esp when the cost of internet far exceeds what my employer will reimburse me for using. Oh, and when they \""improved\"" their billing format, it has made if far more difficult to understand and no one can answer questions about what some fees are about.Lots of room for improvement."
1,"This is such a cool place, I must say I liked everything about it.  My boyfriend and I were in Vegas about two weeks ago and we had read good reviews about this place. So we decided to take a cab from the strip to Downtown Fremont. $20 later we arrived and the lights at Fremont Experience were not on, so we walked opposite from the casinos and found the Griffin, we go in and there are only 2 guys in there...I went into the restroom and by the time I came out the place was starting to get a pretty good crowd. The jukebox has the greatest rock cd's...from Janis to Kings of Leon...my boyfriend picked some songs and the crowd seemed pretty in to it. The bartender chick made both my Vodka & Tonic and my boyfriend's Jack and Coke VERY strong...but we didn't complain after all we were on vacation =) We're definitely going back the next time we go to Vegas."
0,Getting caught up on my yelp posting.  I always get behind when I take a trip and Vegas always leads to lots of new places.  We were staying at Aria on the trip so wanted to give the different restaurants a try.  Being big fans of Asian food this was most definitely on the list.\n\nFirst I really did enjoy the meal.  The service was really great and we had some good times talking to our server.  We were headed to a 7PM show so we got there before the everyone else.  The room itself is really to big for my tastes.  It is a massive room and some could say it feels like an airport terminal in size.  I prefer my sushi in a much more cozy setting.  The other negative was the price point.  This place is way expensive.  In my mind I always have to add a $ to everything in Vegas but this one really went over the top.  Those two items forced me to knock this down the stars down.\n\nThe food was really good.  The sushi was very fresh and had a great presentation.  We tried a number of different items and enjoyed all the flavors.  I will say you will get a good meal but the price point just throws this off the curve.
1,"I've been here too many times. When I worked down the street coming here was a breeze.\nThis is what this place has gotten me... a friend for life.\n A job. A lost a friend :( and I once sat here for over 7 hours or so drinking and talking about music until the sun came up. And that my friends is a strange experience walking out and the morning sun kisses your face.\nI use this place to meet old friends, get new friends. The food is pretty good and I've won good here and rather....not talk about it moments.\nMy co worker (the one who got me a job) comes here so much that everyone has a nick name for him and whenever I meet up with him he's like a celebrity. \nI also Love that this one is big for a few pool tables.. And a separate seating area for certain meet up groups (So I've seen).\nBottom line. When the advertisements say this is my PT's.. yeah.. it's this one for me."
1,"Great \""modern mexican\"" place.  Don't go here looking for anything authentic.  It is certainly on the pricier side of mexican food, but it is fairly priced for what it is.  \n\nWe ate here late on a Saturday night and got the \""front and center\"" outdoor table.  We had a blast, as the people watching on a nice night is outstanding (WHERE do all of these crazies come from, really!!??)\n\nSo long as you know what you are walking into here, you'll have a great experience."
0,"One of my least favorite airports.  The flights I end up taking into Charlotte (e.g., STL to PHF) invariably seem to have me jumping across a few terminals to make my connection.  You'd think the situation would be improved by the huge number of moving walkways connecting the different gates, but there is NOTHING more infuriating than being stuck behind a family of four blocking the entire walkway, or someone slowly trudging along on the left.\n\nFor god's sake, people: Just like on the road, pass on the left, walk on the right.  There are people in this airport, obviously not you, that are in a HURRY.\n\nCan't speak much to the food and drink options here.  The selections seem plentiful.  US Airways was friendly to me here, too, when a flight was canceled back home.  They shuttled me to a nearby hotel -- I forget where -- and covered both my transportation and lodging for the night.  Good work, guys."
1,"Let's face it... everyone will keep shopping at VS no matter how bad the reviews are here.  It's not like you go there for the service.  That said, I go out of my way to visit this location when I'm shopping for my girlfriend.  The girls here are actually pretty pleasant, actually say \""hello\"" and welcome you rather than scattering as if to pretend to have things to do other than help you (read my Scottsdale review), and have provided good assistance in the past.  I like the layout of the store better here, too.  The vibe is just better and it's worth visiting this location,"
1,"Great place with a really cool vibe!\n\nIt doesn't matter if you are new in the CrossFit world, here you will find people willing to help and a coach who cares about his athletes."
1,Everything here was good.  The burgers and shakes were great.
1,"Pub food, but a unique take on pub food. Yummy spicey Bloody Mary!"
0,"I first went to the Penguin in 2008 and it was awesome.  Hip vibe, crowded, cold beer, and delicious food.  Alas, time has not been kind to the penguin.  I have tried it several times since then when I found myself in downtown Charlotte and it has gotten progressively worse each time.\n\nThe food is still good - how can you go wrong with pimento cheese?  However, the servers are clueless, the service slow, the menu is smaller, the beer selection is limited, the kitchen is slower.  It is sad because the neighborhood has finally caught up with the coolness of what the Penguin used to be.  Do yourself a favor and try one of the many new restaurants that have opened while the Penguin was resting on its TV appearances.  Going to the Penguin will just leave you disappointed."
1,"I stayed here over the weekend and really enjoyed it. Aria is deffinitely the place to stay if you are going to be in Vegas. I was pretty impressed that all the rooms were remote control. Also, you are easily accessible to sooo much. \n\nMy only reservations from keeping this from a five-star review is that some things were ridiculously expenisive. My bf forgot his socks, so we went down to the Aria gift shop where they charge 8 bucks a pair--no name brand or anything. I ordered a $7 latte. Also, there weren't very many casual places to eat in Aria. Everything was basically fine-dining.\n\nOther than that the service, the room, the casino, the pool etc. was amazing! :)"
0,"I wish I hand 1 more hand so I could give this place 3 thumbs down. I make better french toast in my kitchen...I am not sure if they know what vanilla and cinnamon are. The eggs were alright and the bagel was OK as well. Nothing special at all, but I was actually surprised how they were able to make their french toast so tasteless."
0,"Of the 13 times in the last 10 years, we've stayed here 11 times; this was our favorite hotel and casino. We love the location, the casino, the Starbucks inside- everything.\n\nChecking in has never been the most hospitable part of the trip. We understand that they're trying to get a bunch of people checked in and out simultaneously, and we don't mind waiting in the long line.\n\nWe booked our trip long before the 3PM check-in time rule, and we arrived at 8 in the morning. I asked the Manager how I might be able to pay the extra $25 dollars to check in early, and he quite rudely told me that I just couldn't check in until later. He then told me that we had to leave the lobby, and take our luggage out of it. When I asked another person what was going on, she begged me to please get my luggage out of the lobby before her Manager had a talk with her about it.\n\nWhen we were finally able to check in at 10AM, I commented on how rude the Manager was (and that everyone else was nice) and she looked worried that he might overhear me. He stood in the background frowning and shaking his head \""no\"" the entire 20 minutes we waited in the express check-in line.\n\nI HATE IT WHEN EMPLOYEES ARE SCARED OF THEIR BOSSES- this is not the way to manage staff. This is unprofessional, and does not give the customer a very good impression of how things are run.\n\nPlus- the pool is a miserly little pad of water, and all of the chairs are chained together in these creepy rows. It's just not aesthetic or comfortable to sunbathe so close to strangers. Every other hotel on the strip has a much better family-friendly pool, even the Flamingo or the Monte Carlo!\n\nWe have just booked another trip, and we're going to stay elsewhere, until we hear they've gotten their acts together."
1,"Great diner to stop in and enjoy hefty portions of breakfast food while you're chilling in Henderson, NV.\n\nWe stopped in on a busy Sunday morning and only had to wait for about 15 min before we were seated. They're pretty fast and efficient here, and I'm talking about the local customers not just the servers. :P\n\n-Eggs are cooked well.\n-House potatoes were BOMB diggity! I totally thought I was going to pass on these but they're like thinly sliced potatoes sauted lightly with some salt and pepper. I ate them like chips! \n-Pumpkin bread was moist and delicious as well.\n\nDefinitely a diner we will return to if we're ever in this area again. \n\nSide note: If you're sort of a \""health freak\"" but you do enjoy diner food, bring your own packets of Stevia to sweeten your coffee. They only carry the \""bad sh*t\"" here (Sweet'N Low or)."
1,Went to this shop today 10/17. It was closed. Now they have a Modern Sushi open in the old spot. Just for the benefit of other patrons looking for it -- its now CLOSED.
1,"If you're in the mood for extravagance and over-the-top WOW - definitely wine & dine at Le Cirque. The service was probably the best I've ever experienced anywhere, EVER. The food was so delicious (although a little buttery but isn't all French food?), and our sommelier was simply amazing - so UNpretentious, unlike most sommeliers who act holier-than-thou. He gave us excellent recommendations, so en pointe with every selection; he was witty and charming and just lovely.\nFor the experience, the food, the service, the ambiance, everything - definitely worth it."
1,"part of my power walk routine ....although this last week it was jog - power walk ...at times i'll stop at fresh and easy, other times, albertson's and if it's one of those days i didn't wake up until 10 or so ( sorry boodah for late breakfast ! )  then i might end the exercise at the doorsteps of black bear diner ....it's all about the breakfast ( they are open for lunch and heck...maybe dinner...not even sure ! ) my sis loves their country fried steak ...just give me the ham steak, eggs and those biscuits and i'm a happy camper !!!  i'm not sure...but the place might actually be a chain....it doesn't feel that way ..it feels like a local hangout....if you need a good hearty breakfast and your on the westside - black bear diner is worth a looksy"

1,I love having 100 channels. I hate not being able to see them because of a bad signal. I also hate dodging taxis while trying to get back and forth from valet.
1,"Great local spot!  Recommended by my old college roommate and he was right on the mark.  Great service, very nice people, great little bar downstairs and the food was excellent.  The sea bass was fantastic.  Their warm sourdough bread is fantastic.\n\nI would definitely recommend this place to anyone - I'm going back the next time I'm in Madison."
1,"Yep. I am fine!  Good, quick, and tasty American favorite!  How can I not be dammit. Everyone go check it out at least once. If I was GF I be all over the shakes they have too. \n\nQuality service as well!"
1,"My friend and fellow Yelper Robyn N. put together a little birthday UYE for me at this amazing buffet.  We were joined by Jeromy H. and Scott W.  And of course my daughter, Claire.  \n\nThis is by far the best buffet I have been to in years!  Since it was a Sunday we induged in the mimosas and Bloody Mary's they offered with our meal.  Walking into the buffet area was like walking into a food dream.  There was the usual salad offerenings and some different soups. And several different areas of asian food with my daughter's favorite, fried shrimp, as well as my favorite, coconut shrimp.  There was an omelet station, delicious bacon and yummy potatoes.  I had the best salmon I have ever had!  It was like butter and metled in your mouth.  And there was pizza made right there in the pizza oven.  My daughter and I watched and they made her a special pizza of her favorite topping, black olives!  She loved it!  There were so many choices and everything was delicious.  \n\nAnd desert.....omg!  They have a gelato station with about 12 different flavors.  I tried the Limoncello and it was delicious!  There was pie and cake and pudding and cookies.....my daughter was in heaven!!  \n\nWe had a great time with good friends and delicious food!  I can't wait to go back!"
0,"I called this store to ask for their price of milk because it wasn't advertised in their ad this week. As soon as I finished my question the lady on the other end exhales a huge breath of air as if I was the worst thing that could have existed. I hear her ask someone else next to her and the male voice stated he didn't know. She then said she thinks it's $2.98, sighed again, and then said she's going to connect me with the dairy manager.  When I'm transferred a guy picks up the phone, I ask my question and he says \""uhhhh, well the Shamrock Farms milk will be on sale next week 40% off. That starts Wednesday\""\n\nOmg. Why are these people in customer service and who is managing them?!\n\nI ended just driving to Fry's which was further (and I was trying to avoid the further drive). Fry's had their milk price advertised but I was hoping if bashas' was cheaper or the same I could go there. I usually get better customer service at this location than at other Bashas' locations but no matter which store I go to, I get the feeling of a struggling business with employees that have been there for awhile and are just there to scan and beep at the register or stock shelves.\n\nHonestly, what kind of training do these people get if they can treat people like they don't care!"
0,Yuk. poor food and even worse service.
1,I just found out that this store will be opening at 5am and not 12 midnight like many of their competitors.  Hat's off to American for doing the right thing and allowing their employees to enjoy Thanksgiving.  I up them a star for this and urge others to support them since they know how to properly treat this national holiday.
0,PLEASE DO NOT TAKE YOUR CAR HERE.. WORST EXPERIENCE EVER!!! I WISH I WOULD HAVE TOOK THE TIME TO READ THE BAD REVIEWS ON THIS PLACE BEFORE I TOOK MY CAR HERE LAST WEEK AND PAID FOR THEM TO MESS IT UP!! I strongly recommend you take your call somewhere else. I took my car in last week to have the breaks done as soon as I left the place my car now shakes when i drive it no matter what speed I am going. I took my car back to them today because obviously it had to be something they did since it was not going on until after I left. The man that looked at my car today just started the car drove it in and out the garage then came and told me it was the tires. How could it be the tires if this was not happening before coming to get my breaks done by them. he was extremely rude and my car would have been better off with the bad breaks and no shaking. I will never go here again and I hope this saves you form making a mistake and taking your car here!!!
0,"Yah, the place is seriously called \""Pink Taco.\"" I don't know if there is some sexual connotation involved but I guess I have a perverted mind. Anywho...this place is defintely not the best Mexican food I have ever had.  It probably isn't even in my top 10.  I got the fish tacos, and was very unsatisfied, the fish was rubbery and had very little flavor.  The location is nice for shopping, nice shops around the area and the service was friendly.  It seems like the happening spot, but we went in the middle of the day.  It's geared to a younger generation crowd, maybe in the mid 20's...but next time I am in Arizona, I definitely will not hit up this spot."
0,"skip this place. there are much better Italian restaurants in phoenix. \n\npros:\n(1) the food tasted OK (as good as Olive Garden)\n\ncons:\n(1) the decor was extremely outdated...it felt like a retirement home\n(2) way too much \""mozzarella\"" cheese on my entree \n(3) it felt like my food was not freshly prepared...perhaps it had been under a heat lamp for a while."
1,"Went here for a quick weekday breakfast while running errands.  \nStaff= friendly. \nService= quick & pleasant. \nFood= better than expected. French Dip, Standard Cheeseburger and Green Chile cheeseburger all delivered.  \nPlace could use an update and even a good cleaning on the windows and walls but it wasn't gross or anything."
0,"I shop at this frys ALL THE TIME, and up until yesterday, Ive never had a bad experience. \nYesterday I went into the store looking for Fig jam/spread/preserves. My husband was at another frys earlier that day, and said he saw some with the specialty cheese. \nI went and looked over there first and didn't see it. Saw a nice employee in the produce area and asked for his help, and he directed me to the deli department and to ask them. The deli department told me to ask produce.....\nAfter that, I went to the customer service desk to ask them. No one was at the counter....\nAnother employee, walked by and asked if I needed help, and we went to the jelly aisle to check there and nothing. She then paged for the manager (I believe his name was TJ) and he proceeded to tell me that they didn't have it in any of the frys stores.... \nI let him know that my husband had seen it at one just earlier that day, and he insisted, rather rudely, that he had checked multiple locations and nothing came up....\nThat employee that walked by's name was Fitore and she recruited Sarah and the two of them were SUPER friendly, and tried to help to the best of their efforts!!\nNeedless to say, after that I replaced the items that I had in my cart, back to their rightful place, and then I left.\nI have never been treated so rudely before at a frys. The people who tried to help along the way had been very kind, then out of all the people I would have expect to have the most excellent customer service, was just rude!\nToday, while running errands, I decided to go back the frys my husband had seen it at, and it was exactly where he said it would be. While looking for it, I was greeted by Zhyra and she was SUPER nice and helpful.... Im sticking with that frys from now on even if it is 6+ miles away, and this location is less then a mile away."
1,"What a unique place to visit!  Alittle touristy, but alot of great spots for photo ops.  There is not much, but the name was so interesting that we had to check it out!"
1,"Wow, some pretty good reviews for a stadium with such a horrible baseball team (that's not really debatable, folks...)\n\nBut I will say, the best part of this stadium is sitting behind home plate.  You get the most beautiful view of the city.  Another thing I've noticed after being in this city so many times is that Pittsburgh loves fireworks.  Quite often they will have fireworks after a game.  More so than other stadiums I've seen.\n\nThey do have a Primanti Brothers here which I personally would recommend going to the original one in the Strip District... but if you can't make your way over there, it's the type of thing that's worth having at least once in your life.\n\nThis ballpark also offers tours (which are led by my cousin!) It's a good way to keep baseball alive in the off season! =)"
0,"Didn't realize how terrible this place was until I went somewhere else. Reason I went somewhere else is because they told me that I couldn't do my wellness check and std screening together- when I always have in the past. They wanted me to schedule two separate visits where I would have to pay two separate co pays.... I went to a new doctor and not only did she do it all in one visit she also gave me my birth control on the spot with no charge and without going to the pharmacy, and I also found out that the Estrella clinic had given me false information. This place treats you like a cattle not a person. I would never recommend this place"
1,"So I made another trip here during the 2009 CES, and it was just as fun as ever.  It was just as lively as before, and the band did an excellent job of making this place a fun and entertaining evening for us.  At some point in the night, the band announced that a very special guest would be coming in soon, but we had no idea what to expect... (more on that later)\n\nSo my friend and I ended up with the jagerschnitzel, which is a fried and breaded pork dish that also came with some spatzle (handmade German pasta).  Not as big as my meal last time I was here, but still very good.  The one thing that is cool is that instead of bringing bread to the table, they bring out a soft pretzel and several dipping sauces.  The pretzel was very good, and for me, just the regular mustard was good enough.  Our other friend got another dish that was all sausage, and that looked really good too.\n\nOur waitress was very fun, and came by to check up on us regularly, but not to a point that it got annoying.  She also noticed that my friend and I both had a bunch of cameras out, and told us that the \""special guest\"" was about to arrive, and we should rush the big double doors before anyone else got there.\n\nThe doors open, and it's none other than David Hasselhoff!  So he comes in with a camera crew, my friend and I are busy snapping up pictures, everyone is rushing the area he is walking, and he makes his way to the band area.  He talks a little, and then starts signing \""Freedom\"", and says that he is happy to be at the HOFFbrau haus.  \n\nIt was definitely an enjoyable evening, and I think we will start to make the Hoffbrau Haus as one of our CES traditions."
0,"This restaurant made my fiance and I physically ill. It is by far the worst sushi joint I have ever been to. Not only did they completely screw up my takeout order, but they served us bad fish. I called to speak with management and was told I would be called back the next day. I called back the next day after my call wasn't returned, and again, no manager. Same thing for day 3 and 4. Only after threatening to contact the health department was I coincidentally given to the manager. Who offered no apology, and instead offered a $20 credit for next time. Why on earth would I return to a restaurant that made me sick?? Anyway, I was eventually offered a $11.99 cash refund. Which is a complete joke, not to mention insult. I will be contacting the health department this morning, as this is not acceptable. This place should be shut down for criminal negligence."
0,"Nice people for sure.\nBeer selection trying to be hip by overpricing it.  Their food gimmick is that they serve everything on a cafeteria tray....,I guess.  Marble rye bread was good. I got a half sandwich and 'salad'. White iceberg lettuce, limp accompanying veggies.  Maybe their next produce delivery is tomorrow, who knows. \nThe dressing was good though, Honey Dijon. Oh, and bathroom was EW. \n\nValidated Discount parking underneath- $3.00 for 2 hours, vs $6.00."
1,"The service was a little slow to start off, but when it came to the food it was definately interesting. I got the Triple Bypass burger which is 1 1/2 lbs of beef plus 11 slices of bacon, tomatoes, onions and cheese for $14. I also got the butterfat chocolate shake which came with a slice of butter as garnishment. Perhaps I will go here again in a few months after my body recuperates from this time."
1,"Omfg.\nThis place was so much fun.\nLike Japan's version of willy wonka's delicious factory.\nThe menu is edible and comes with a dipping sauce.\nEverything was beyond delicious and the whole place smelled like what I hope heaven smells like.\nI'm quite certain I will be going to heaven because I am awesome.\nUntil that day comes, I will be going here. Often."
0,"It was decent. I loved my dish but some of my friends didn't like theirs. \n\nI had the sesame crusted ahi tuna and it was really good. The tuna was just right and the sauce was fantastic. However, I tried some kind of spanish Chicken dish and the chicken was super dry. They had to return it and order something else. They got the seabass instead cooked with a light ginger soy sauce. It was cooked just right and the taste was really good. I just think everything is a bit overpriced for the quality of food. \n\nI do have to say I like the atmosphere of the restaurant. It's very intimate and classy, a good place for a date night. \n\nSo if you decide to go here, my advice is to stay away from the chicken and order seafood!"
1,"I stayed here for New Year's Eve and an event following the holiday. I loved it! My room was newly remodeled, beautiful, and clean. I worked with their fantastic staff and I felt as if we were partners working toward the same goal. I was really impressed by how well the staff handled things that went wrong and how flexible and helpful they were in helping us to achieve our goals together. I will definitely be going back."
1,"I ate at Golden Buddha a few weeks ago.  We ate at the restaurant after a day at the zoo with our 4 year old and had a blast.  The piano bar played tunes for my daughter and the staff was more than accommodating.  The general tso chicken was better than anything I can get in Tucson.  The soup was chocked full of fresh, read FRESH, not canned, vegetables.  All in all, I was very satisfied with the meal and the service.  Plus the decor is very nice, clean and cheery. \n\nEat at Golden Buddha."
1,"Location, location, location.  This has become my group of friends and I preferred hotel for a number of reasons. One you can't beat the location at the corner of The Strip and Flamingo road you are smackdown in the middle of the strip. Plus with the Linq opening up close by it makes the location even better. As far as bang for the buck the hotel offers a lot of value especially if your like my friends and I and all you use your room for is a to $hit, shower,  shave, and sleep because your too busy having fun to watch t.v. in your room. The pool at the flamingo is really nice and they have a party pool and a family pool so you dont have to worry about a bunch of kids running around and taking up valuable lounge chair space. And finally my friends and I really like the vibe of the poker room and they have a bar next to the poker room so drink service is usually very quick.\n\nNow if I was going for a weekend with a pretty lady I probably would choose a more luxurious hotel with better rooms, but as a boys or girls weekend place for the money I dont think you can do any better than Flamingo Las Vegas."
1,This is my favorite pho joint in all of Arizona. I have been to about 17 from flagstaff to mesa to central and Tucson! The owners are so welcoming and very proud of their business and it shows! The place is always clean and the bathrooms are immaculate! I always order pho Tai and water.. But I've had both their egg rolls and spring rolls both excellent! I love the broth! It's true pho broth.. It's not the beef bullion cubes other place use and you can defiantly taste the difference! The sprouts are the cleanest I have ever seen! I love this pho place ...  try the greatest pho in Arizona!
0,"I still love the food.... But the service is getting progressively worse! Last night we went out with friends and we had a gift card and wanted to pay our half of the bill with it. So we asked the waiter to just split the check between the gift card and the debut card. Well e ones skipping back hey guess what you didn't need to split it, the gift card had enough on it for the entire meal! Really?!? Idiot! So we explain to him that not what we said and to fix it... He comes back ten minutes later basically telling u the same thing... Umm no I want my money back! It took a total of 35 mins from dropping off the check at the table to leaving! I was so frustrated with this guy! If your servers can't understand basic math like divide by two... Then get out of there! Anyways love the food but the hostess and servers are lacking. Maybe I should just go back to the paradise location!"
0,"Please....do yourself a favor and do NOT waste your time or money. This club is for the most part ridiculous (as in, BAD).\n\nI have been on 2 occasions: one for Kaskade and one for Above&Beyond. There are so many issues that they need to work on. Both times they had a hip hop opener on a house music night! WTF? The #4 DJ in the world and you open with lame ass hip hop (that's a bad DJ as it is)?? Way to drop the ball Marquee.....\n\nThen, you probably pay off the fire marshall to WAY OVERPACK the club to levels where dangerous mobs of people will literally crush you between between. You can not walk anywhere... and everywhere you try and stand the bouncer says, \""You have to move. You can't stand there. Sorry, you can't stand there either. You have to move.\"" Move WHERE?! \n\nThe dancefloor is *tiny*. Too bad they wasted all the space on the patio. The stage/light show set up is amazing and the sound system good, BUT, amidst all the bad stuff, please... stay far, far away. \n\nSide note: my girlfriend and her dude ordered 1 round of 2 drinks at the bar and the tab for those 2 drinks?? $55!!! Insane. Also, 80% of the club is asian so you better be OK with that too."
0,We ate here based on a recommendation from a wonderful worker of this hotel. Seemed great. We came as a group of 4 on a Monday night. Not busy at all and was seated promptly.  We ordered some beers and waters along with appetizer. .fried pickles yummy. We got our drinks but no appetizers.  So in the meantime we ordered our food. Mind you our waiter was great however the food service was extremely slow. We built our own burgers and all but one person ordered med-well and the other well done. We figured since she orderd hers well that what was taking so long. We go out food and but into a raw mooing burgers.  My husband isn't one to cause a scene about returning food so we just ate what we could and prayed we didn't throw it up later. I wasn't happy at all. The 2 stars are for the server.
1,"Overall, a great place to hang out.  The chips were a little stale but the corn salsa had large chunks of tomato which made it extra special.  The Tavarua Wahoo Tacos were very tasty and had just the right amount of heat.  We sat on the veranda since it was a nice evening.  The service was great - constantly checking on us.  The noise level inside was on the higher side.  The Nectar of the Gods margarita went down very fast.  My only disappointment was that they don't serve any Johnny Walker!!!"
1,"We spent almost a week in Scottsdale and by far, this was my favorite restaurant! Although there are about 7-10 traditional sushi rolls, it's really about the grilling menu that makes it so unique. I also love the open dining area and you can see the chefs preparing your food on the robata grill. We ordered the soft shell crab roll and pork belly for appetizers - very tasty. For dinner we shared the Black Cod Miso and that was my very favorite thing on the menu! Light, buttery and sweet, and grilled. We loved our dinner so much we ended up coming here two more times during our trip but ate at the bar for happy hour (5pm-10pm!). I would have given it 5 stars, but the portions were just a wee bit small for the price (a black code skewer was $5 at happy hour, but literally it was like 2 bites big!). Check out the block of ice in the bar and how the bartender cuts it for shochu drinks...pretty interesting to watch!"
1,"I really like this place.  I am extremely picky about massage and my philosphy on spa services is that I feel that small businesses give extra service because they depend on repeat regular customers  to stay in business. \nResorts are good for the amenities and the experience but I don't think that facials and massages are that great at resorts in my experience because they don't count on you coming back on a regular basis.  The customer is usually there on vacation or work convention etc. \nAt Tranquil Star,  I had purchased a \""buy with me\"" deal and had the 90 minutes deep tissue massage.  I have gotten regular massages for the past ten years and I think the therapist here is probably one of the best I've tried in AZ.  I have a lot of low back pain, forearms and wrists hurt from too many hours on the computer at work.  He addressed all those issues I had and he made sure that I was happy with the pressure.  I think they are open everyday by appointment only and they have some great summer prices right now.  It's centrally located in old town Scottsdale and parking is plenty (or at least it was on a Sunday afternoon). Even without the \""buy with me\"" deal, it's an excellent value because he has special pricing during the summer.  I've already booked my next appointment!  Seriously though, if it wasn't good I wouldn't give it 4 stars cuz I haven't reviewed many with 4 stars. If you are looking for a really super nice swank atmosphere this isn't the place for you but if you are looking for excellent massage, simple clean atmosphere, and great value, then you need to check this place out...."
1,"I love new experiences and was able to try some chipolte lengua (tongue). I was surprised at how mellow a texture the tongue was, but I definitely enjoyed it, though I would have liked to have tried a different sauce that it was cooked in. The waiter was very friendly, the hostess was cute, and the accompanying conversation from the table next to mine about some outlandish feat made for a good dining experience."
0,"I had never eaten at Nathan's before and I was really in the mood for a hot dog. Plus, like everyone else says there's not much of a choice when you've reached this stage in the race to your gate. My husband, son, and myself all ordered chili dogs, fries, and a drink. That tallied out to about $26 dollars give or take which is outrageous but not totally unexpected for airport food. After I got the bill and my stroke we sat down and tried to eat this swill. Which is exactly what it is! The cheese for the hot dogs is nacho cheese, is that normal? Is that something that's done in life? Anyway, and the crinkle fries were greasy and totally tasteless. There was nothing at all redeeming about this place. I always try to avoid eating at the airport but if'n I have to it will never be at Nathans Famous Hotdogs. One last thing, who in the heck serves chili dogs but doesn't offer a place to sit?"
1,"Pro's: beautiful hotel\n          Classy\n\nCons: stuffy image. Makes me feel like u need a dinner jacket every time you enter.\n           The light show although nice, is a bit short."
0,"Sorry Nine Fine, $7.50 for a Newcastle is a mugging and won't get you beyond two stars.\n\nNine Fine Irishmen is located inside the New York, New York casino.  It's more than just an Irish pub.  The ornate d\u00e9cor and split level venue make it seem a little more classy than a hole in the wall.  But I have serious gripes with this place.\n\nThe crowd: You are guaranteed to come across packs of oblivious tourists.  It starts as you wait to get in and only gets worse the deeper you get inside.  These are the folks who just stand in the middle of the room staring at the wall while you try to weave your way through.  They're inescapable.\n\nThe booze:  8 bucks for a Guinness and $7.50 for a Newcastle is about as expensive as it gets on the strip.  And when it's served in a clear college style plastic cup half the time, good luck expecting any kind of tip from me.\n\nThere are a few bright spots.  The venue itself seems very authentic.  And on many nights you'll have live Irish music which is certainly better than another dj playing Boom Boom Pow every 20 minutes.  But hey if that's your cup of the just go out to the patio seating and you'll hear the music bleeding over from Rok next door.  If you have money to burn I would go to Nine Fine during the day if you feel you must experience it, otherwise it's not worth it."
1,"Five stars for quality, green maintenance, hidden driving range and overall course design.  As far as the club house, I would say the kids there seem to be some problems.  \n\nSummer time,\nBest Wednesday Special $17.50 with cart! Wow.  \nClothing required, Collared shirt and pants, or khaki shorts.  Even for the driving range.  I was asked to put on a collared shirt  for the range, I had one but got the hint that I was not welcomed.  If your read this far I ask you to help save Karstin Golf Course."
0,"Very fun atmosphere. Bright insides with great artwork EVERYWHERE! The food is fresh and made to order. Lots of specials. I had the chicken salad sandwich and fresh New England clam chowder soup. Tons of clams in the soup and the chicken salad was good (had apples and celery). I specially asked for Miracle Whip (request option on the menu) on the sandwich and that was a great blast from the past taste. \n\nI liked the music playing and the games on every table. Great service too.\n\nPROS: Great interior and excellent service.\n\nCONS: Food was just average at best.\n             My boyfriend HATED it. \n            *Big Fish Sandwich - Over breaded and too much bread in general. \n             Needed more tartar sauce or lettuce or something.\n             *Chicken Avocado BLT - I ordered \""breaded\"" for the chicken. \n              It came out fried to a crisp and the thin cutlet inside was dry as a bone. \n\nTwo stars only because of the great atmosphere and decor. I would give the service 5 stars if that was a separate option."

Le service \u00e9tait moche, inefficace et sans sourire...\n\nJ'ai tellement \u00e9t\u00e9 rebut\u00e9e par mon exp\u00e9rience de la cuisine indienne que je n'ai remis les pieds dans un resto indien que 8 ans plus tard, en 2006, pour un souper de groupe, l'anniversaire d'un ami.

1,Awesome burgers.
0,"Mesa Grill was extremely overpriced and the service was annoying. I understand it's Vegas, but for the prices, I expected better, quieter service. Our waiter came up every five minutes trying to take our plates, pouring water in between us and our conversations, asking questions... I understand being diligent but this was annoying. \n\nThe pork loin was the best thing any of us got. It was definitely very good. So was the shrimp tamale. I think that's actually the best thing on the menu, but quite rich so you can split that and the pork with someone and be totally satisfied as the portions are huge.\n\nOne of us had the coffee crusted steak, and the rub was just too spicy to really enjoy the meat. The fish was bland and slightly overcooked. Desserts were awful. Seriously, how hard is it to make good churros? The donuts at a fast food restaurant are better!\n\nIf you are a fan of Bobby Flay's other restaurants -- Bar Americain is one of my favorites -- you will be very disappointed here. The quality, service and atmosphere are just so mediocre it really disappoints. Oh, and the price - I think it's more expensive than eating in his restaurant in Manhattan, which is just mind-boggling because this is Vegas, for God's sake."
1,"I like bouchon. I'm normally not even a pastry fan but I really like the pastries they served here. The pastry basket comes with your choice of 4 different pastries and they come out nice and warm a great starter to share for the table. Their main dishes also won't disappoint. i tried the chicken and waffles which was excellent\n\nI tried the oysters here too. Not too bad! Although, I am a huge fan of oysters so I generally like all types of oysters :P"
0,Food will not knock your socks off. Food borders on ordinary to bland. Frozen beverages taste like flavored sugar. Definitely over rated. Plus place is always packed!
0,The steaks were excellent but overshadowed by the incredible lousy inattentive server who basically took the order and dropped off the bill. Most of the wait staff hung out by the entryway chatting among themselves. Poor management. Never going back.
0,"My fiance and I were really excited to try this place because of the Yelp reviews. I'm not sure if everything we chose was not the right thing to choose, but we were pretty disappointed. \n\nWe started with the Sunrise Spider Roll + Fish egg with tempura soft-shell crab and the crab tasted like muddy crawfish. Maybe not the freshest? It was also really expensive for the portion we received. \n\nMisoshiru was very under-salted. \n\nMy unagi kabayaki was full of bones (I'm guessing this is normal; it was my first time having it) and I spent the entire night picking out pin bones with my chopsticks, which actually really improved my chopstick skills. That was a plus.\n\nMy fiance had the broiled black cod, which he said completely saved his entire experience. I tasted it and agreed.\n\nWhy does fried chicken accompany every meal? It didn't really match any of the flavor profiles of any of our dishes, but it was pretty good taste-wise. Not the best fried chicken or anything, but three little nuggets don't hurt when you're given such a small sushi roll portion. \n\nIdeally, I'd like to try a place two more times before reviewing it, but we will definitely not be coming back. \n\nWe've only tried one other sushi place, Plum, and it's definitely our regular place to go. Until we wanted to be adventurous and try other sushi places. \n\nDisappointed. :(\n\nGood points: Really fast service. We were asked how the food was every half-minute and our table was cleared off after each item was complete. It felt a little rushed but we appreciated the customer service."
0,"Traditional 70's style Italian-American food in a strip mall mainly notable because you can bring your own wine with no corkage fee.  Don't believe the hype - this place is nothing special.\n\nContrary to the many reviews here that comment on how cheap it is, I found it a bit expensive for what you're getting, which is not exactly nuova cucina.  $15.95 for two small (non-homemade) cannelloni a la carte is not a bargain in my book.  Their linguine with white clam sauce is some canned clams tossed with a copious amount of oil (1/2 a cup perhaps) and some boxed pasta for $12.95.  The $9.95 \""insalata Romana\"" is a plate of tired iceberg lettuce, a tomato wedge or two, and a few shreds of bland cheese swimming in a very tart vinaigrette.   \n\nThis is the kind of food that used to represent Italian food in America before the food revolution of the 80's.  The kind of place you'd find, not in New York or Chicago, but in Terre Haute or Tampa at a time when \""eye-talian\"" food was still considered a bit exotic.\n\nThe many reviews stating that this is \""real homemade Italian food\"" are a bit puzzling since it's neither homemade nor Italian.  This is very old-fashioned pre-foodie Italian-American food and while it's OK for what it is, it certainly isn't \""real Italian\"" food by any stretch of the imagination nor is it, for the most part, homemade.  \n\nN.B. No, a visit to this restaurant is not \""just like going to Italy.\""  For that matter, it's not just like going to Little Italy.  I realize Phoenix is not exactly a mecca for italian food, but WTF people!  \n  \nThe mostly 60+ crowd seems to love it.  I can only guess that they are overwhelmed by nostalgia for a simpler time, because while it may not be Kierland pretentious nor a crappy chain restaurant, the food just isn't very good.  Seriously. \n\nThe servers have a strange attitude that I guess is supposed to be \""east-coast\"" or something (rushed, cocky, borderline rude) but seems a bit out of place in what is basically a mom and pop strip mall joint serving canned food with plastic red checked tablecloths and thin paper napkins.  In any case, they are very selective with their attention and you can wait quite a while to get something.\n\nAlso, as several other reviewers have pointed out, they give you a non-itemized bill with just the total due written on it which seems to include an extra 10% or so with no explanation offered.   This seems quite bizarre to me but apparently no one objects.  At this restaurant, $15.95 + $12.95 + $9.95 somehow add up to $45.65.  The non-itemized bill is a weird affectation at best - why would you do that, especially in a cheap joint like this?  But to do that and then mis-calculate?  There's a word for that in Italian - it's imbrogliare. \n\n$54 for two with tip for a simple shared salad and two pasta dishes with no meat and no drinks."
0,"I came here for a scale. They had none in stock.\n\nThe store itself was relatively tidy, though a bit strangely organized.\n\nTook me a while to find someone to help me, and then took them even longer to tell me they had nothing in stock, even though I started off the conversation with \""there are none on the shelf\"".\n\nThe employees were friendly enough, but the overall experience was meh, even for a Best Buy."
0,"I love outlet malls, I have gone to the malls located in Vegas, I have been to the ones in Casa Grande (when there was actually 2 and they didn't suck or weren't closed), I have to say I haven't been to the one in Anthem yet, but this one is just....meh.\n\nI signed up online to be a \""Preferred Club\"" member and get coupons every time I go (Mind you, it costs money to do this 10.00)...don't do it, its a trap!\n\nThe coupons are ridiculous, you have to spend an extreme amount of money to get discounts at any store. I have four kids, I don't go spend 500.00 at a time at these places.\n\nThe layout is nice, the parking sucks, there aren't a lot of food options, and its outdoor so summer time is going to SUCK.\n\nI will make the drive to this place if I am looking for something specific I know I can get here, past that? I have places a lot closer than this to get anything I need and or want."
0,"Booked a table for 1 through Opentable. When I got there, I was told they would seat me at the bar because the tables were reserved for family style dinner and the portions are designed for sharing food. Ridiculous argument. If I book a table through Opentable, I expect a table, not a barstool."
0,"Sad to give only 1 star.  I would have given them 5 stars after last years experience at the original truck.  They ran out of the plain bread and could only make the sandwiches out of wheat.  We ordered 2 sandwiches and paid a total of $26.78.  My sandwich was supposed to be grilled with Frito's inside (.75 cents extra), there should have been more than 6 soggy chips in there.  VERY disappointed with that.  I probably should have just gotten a plain grilled cheese. For $26.78, we could have purchased about 6 loaves of bread and some fine cheeses and made a MUCH better sandwich at home.  I won't be going back and I hope they lose some stars here.  I also 'Unliked' them on Facebook. OUCH\nIt seems they may have a new fleet of smaller trucks which attend events and serve across the valley, however, it's just not the same experience anymore."
1,"Nice to see a place open early for us working stiffs. Sunrise Cafe opens at 7:00 am and my waiter was friendly and informative of what was popular here.\n\nThe waiter suggested several recommendations but I went with the Glenn's wrap - Grilled diced chicken, egg whites, avocado, Swiss cheese and served on a chipotle tortilla. This was filling, different and yummy tasting.\n\nI enjoyed the Sunrise Cafe and recommend this place over the same old fast food places. They have a good selection and solid service."
1,"I LOVE a good deal, so when I received a coupon in the mail for Top Design Nails, I was intrigued by the $26 mani/pedi which included a FREE eyebrow waxing to boot.  There are a lot of small nail salons near my house, but I haven't really found one that provided quality service worthy of a return...until yesterday.  As soon as I walked inside Top Design I noticed how much cleaner and organized it was than other establishments I had treated my footsies to, and I didn't have to wait at all to get my services started.  Honestly, all three of the services I received were firest rate.  Unlike other places that charge extra for salt scrub, this was included in the service, and my favorite part was the fact that they warm up the lotion before applying it to your feet and legs.  It was such a delightful experience!  \nSince I started grad school I've definitely neglected myself a bit so my eyebrows were in need of some taming.  Anna, the owner of the salon, made them look tip-top in a jiffy.  She also owns the alterations place next door which only charges 8 measly dollars to put the original hem back on designer jeans.  Such a bargain!  This morning I woke up and admired my nails, toes and eyebrows and was so happy that I've found \""my\"" nail place.  Anna informed me that the $26 special will be running for a while so get yourself into Top Design for the best deal in town!"
0,"This review is for the hotel.  Unfortunately, I can't write this without mentioning Herbie, the love bug.\n\nHe wasn't really a love bug, he was a cockroach.  And he decided to keep me company in the bathroom the morning after a late night of drinking, strip clubbin', and more drinking with my girl friends.  Hmmm, who did he keep company during the night and where was the rest of his family?  *shudder*\n\nManagement upgraded us to a suite free of extra charge, which was a little more spacious with an extra TV.  They were friendly enough, but my friend said they didn't seem surprised AT ALL about it.  The next day I thought I had left my iPod behind, and when I realized and we called down to see if we could search for it, we were told that the old room already had new occupants.  Uhhh.\n\nWe were fairly easygoing about it, even named the little bastard, but really that's just nasty.  The casino was cool (e.g. lion cage, restaurants, Studio 54) but I wouldn't book a room here again, personally."
0,"The 2nd star is for the convenience of the location - if you're attending/exhibiting at the las vegas convention center, you can walk right into the center in minutes. That's the only plus.\n\nI don't know where to begin. I'm sitting here in a 19 dollar office chair, i can't hear the tv over the noise of the minifridge (sounds like a helicopter is about to crash into the room) and i just paid 20 dollars and waited an hour for a room service pizza that was served on the plastic tray that they microwaved it on. I went down to meet someone for dinner and a girl tried to steal my phone near the exit to the street. There has been a room service cart down the hall with old food on it for 32 hours. 3/6 lights in my room are operational. I bumped into a wall and dust came out of the ceiling. There's that number of cops that makes you feel like something is wrong instead of feeling safer. The water pressure in the shower is so low it feels like someone is just sweating on you. The mattress looks like a mountain range.\n\nThe staff have all been very helpful and friendly."

0,"Red and Green salsa was good, Guacamole was also good, taco's were ok, margaritas were ok nothing special.\n\nover priced and crappy service even when there is only 2 other tables in the whole restaurant."

1,"It's been 3 days and my fiance and I are still raving about this show.  I RARELY give 5 stars to anything on yelp.  I feel like people waive around 5's for dive bars and garbage shows.  This was just unbelievable. \n\nI still cannot even fathom how such a show was created.  It felt like thousands of performers and so much to watch.....and the best part - it tells a story.  Unlike most other shows where you get just a bunch of high wire acts...this walks you through a dream...and it's a bit of good vs evil.\n\nJaw still on the floor.  I would see this every time I come to Vegas.  And that is saying something because I'm a tight wad!  haha\n\nOf the naysayers - \nthe people below that give it bad ratings don't seem to know a few things.  \n\nA - it's not a Cirque show.  B.  It's called \""the dream\"" - why the heck doesn't anyone read.  They complain they didn't understand and then later go..oh it's a dream.  It's in the title!  Le Reve - the dream!   C.  They don't like the Le Reve is the best water show over their beloved \""O\"".  Why can't someone enjoy both!  \n\nho hum.  Go see it!"
0,"Stopped here for lunch with my BFF today.\n\nNowhere to park, forced to valet, meh...\n\nLove the atmosphere here: classy decor, beautiful patio. Everything on the menu looked delicious. I had a hard time choosing between many foods that I love: crab cakes, goat cheese, crepes... I wanted something lighter so I ordered the oriental chicken salad. In the meantime, our drinks were brought to the table. BFF pulled the spoon out of her iced tea to find that there was some leftover peanut butter still on it. The question is: who left it there? Don't know. Gross. This was pointed out to a server (not ours because she had not returned to our table). Our server brought out a new iced tea. She was polite, but not necessarily apologetic. \n\nWhen our meal was delivered to the table, BFF pointed out that there were tomatoes on her sandwich (she asked for no tomatoes). The server said that the other server probably grabbed the wrong plate. She came back from the kitchen twice to tell us that the new sandwich would be right out. So, I sat with my salad and waited to eat until BFF got her meal (It took a good 5-10 minutes for her new sandwich to come out). \n\nBFF raved about the dressing on her side salad. My salad was fine, but nothing to rave about (especially not for $13). The ingredients were fresh but the \""shredded chicken\"" that was described on the menu appeared to be sliced chicken breast. To be honest, I prefer shredded chicken which is why I had decided on that particular salad. DISAPPOINTING.\n\nThe server arrived at the table to ask if we wanted to order dessert. We replied, \""no, thank you\"". And she said something like, \""oh, come on, are you sure?\"". Again, we declined but I really think she should have offered us free dessert after our bummer lunch.\n\nThe topper? 1 valet guy and 6 people in line to pick up their cars=a 10 minute wait just to leave the place. \n\nI would hesitate to come back, but that menu is just so damn tempting."
0,Do not order sushi from here. The rolls are 3km in diameter and the soy sauce is so salty you may dehydrate on the spot. They use chicken fried rice in their sushi  Chow mein is also questionable. Save your money and your taste buds.
1,"MadHouse coffee is a solid, un-cookie cutter coffee place in Vegas. I really appreciate places that aren't a Starbucks or a Coffee Bean or a Seattles Best. I try to avoid chains as much as possible unless it's a gas station.\n\nMadHouse is located next to one of my favorite nail shops in town. Usually before a pedi on Sundays, I'll stop in at MadHouse which is never too busy. Service is always friendly and they offer some unique flavors: Nutella, Red Velvet, and a few other that are escaping me at the moment.Trust me, these drinks are sweet. I feel like I may get diabetuuus every time I indulge.\n\nMadHouse offers homemade sandwiches and baked item. All of which have been decent, nothing that has me running back or craving. MadHouse has a drive-thru (which doesn't encompass their huge menu - go inside people, especially if you're ording the diabetuuuus lattes and whatnot), offers free Wifi, and has open mic nights, which are odd because the place isn't really built to hold more than I'd say 10-15 comfortably and the tables are like huge slabs of cement. \n\nMy ordered a big iced here once and when I noticed she wasn't drinking it, she said it was sour, and it was. I told her to stop by on the way back to her house, I ran in, they replaced it and apologized and offered me a free cookie (which I declined because it's FESTIVAL SEASON, baby).\n\nMadHouse is good, not great, and certainly not the best coffee house in Vegas, but a nice change of pace from the landscape of so many Starbucks."
0,"This is the first time we stayed at Aria. And I want some Italian food. It's was my birthday and my friend informed them but no free cake and no even any happy bithday greeting for me. I got a pasta dish and it was ok but overpriced. My friend got the special, seabass ($50). And it was bad, I meant how can seabass cooked bad, but it was absolutely no taste. I was so disappointed. This was the most expensive meal during our 3 days trip but the wrost one for sure. Don't waste your money."
0,"Everything about this place was mediocre. The food was mediocre, the ambiance was mediocre and the service was mediocre."
0,"It was 100+ degrees & we came here bc we wanted something cold & refreshing to cool us down.  We walk in and it feels a bit cooler (bc it wasn't 100+ degrees inside), but as we stay inside, it just gets HOT. Y'all should get a better AC or something for this place.  We ordered and waited for our drinks.  The girl brings back TWO tapioca milk teas when we ordered just one.  We tell her, she takes it back, brings another one & says that it's the tapioca milk green tea.  Okay.  We wait and wait.  4 out of 5 drinks come out (we saw her writing down each of the 5 orders).  Okay.  Soon, we decided it's time to leave so we ask the girl for our check & tell her to void the drink that we didn't receive.  She gave us this dirty look, looked at the counter, rolled her eyes, walked away to the cash register, talked to her coworker in her language, and then brought us the check.  We stayed inside bc we were waiting for our taxi to come & the girl at the register kept giving us this dirty look & was waiting for us to leave.  Finally the taxi came and we left. \n\nThis place gets 1 star bc their tapioca milk tea & boba was bomb.  I won't be coming back unless I have no choice."
0,"Not enough staff on Saturday to handle the crowd. The coffee containers were all empty, except one, and mislabeled. I got flavored coffee from the container, which wasn't labeled as such (which by the way, I hate). Other customers were leaving the restaurant very upset because their food was taking so long."
0,"Wait time was terrible! When we did get our food the eggs were cold.  Waitress was nice, I know not her fault for the cooking time."
0,Nothing special. Had an omelette and it tasted like something I'd have in a buffet line. Their toast is amazing though as weird as it sounds. Good butter!! May come back to try speciality pancakes!
0,"Went for lunch. As with any Vegas buffet, the quality of the food is a gamble, and not one you're very likely to win. Sadly, this one counts as a big loss.\n\nAside from the typical decor, it doesn't even feel like a restaurant. Plates and utensils are washed en masse, resulting in eating surfaces that look like they were simply sprayed with a hose and dipped in sanitation solution. In other words, everything looks dirty.\n\nThe food is awful. There's really no other way to put it. Looking at positive reviews, I can't for the life of me understand how anyone could eat this stuff with a smile. Maybe low prices are intoxicating their sense of judgment or they have the perfect combination of deadened taste buds and iron stomachs. The only other buffet I've been to that's worse than this one was at Sante Fe Station, and that one induced vomiting.\n\nOne can't help but shake the feeling this is the foods last chance at being served. Most of the options appear to be right at the borderline of expiration, or at least of the lowest quality. There are seven sections: BBQ, American, Asian, Italian, Mexican, Dessert and the Salad Bar. Don't even think about seafood, because there isn't any. I did my best to try a bit of everything, but it was tough finding anything appetizing from the Asian or Mexican areas. They don't even look right.\n\nMeats are profoundly dry, akin to soft wood. Vegetables are fresher than anything, but the taste of the cooked ones manages to be awful as well. Fruit amounts to little more than watermelon. Meanwhile, you have a bountiful selection of breads. Great. And don't forget dessert. It rounds out the stomach cramps nicely. Though to be fair, they do have a gelato station that sticks out like a sore thumb in a place like this.\n\nI can handle a bad meal as much as anyone, but this stuck with me the rest of the day, assaulting my stomach with night terrors. The single thing I can honestly say I enjoyed was a potato. I implore anyone with a mouth to go anywhere but this people trough. Even from a financial point of view, the food court will satisfy more for the same price."
0,"Bah, a better word for this place would be \""SALT.\""\n\nFrom the salt covered butter that's served with the bread, to the salt drenched salad, arriving at the salty, uninspiring pepperoni pizza, all I could taste was salt. \n\nIt gets two stars simply for the servers, who were awesome and kind people. At least the water they provided was salt-less and helped re-hydrate me."
1,Great experience. Great flavors in the lamb burger (gambino's broken leg of lamb) and the Capone burger with fried egg and sriacha sauce was also delicious. Great bun as it's light and does not overtake. Be sure to get the brussel sprouts appetizer.   Looking forward to trying other items. The s'mores dessert was a nice finish. Also a great bar. Many beers on tap and whiskey selection but opted for the wine.
0,"The one night I ate here with some friends, I shared a Cochinita Pibil and a side of plantains (Pl\u00e1tanos con Crema) with my boyfriend. The slow cooked pork (Cochinita Pibil) was very tender but not very flavorful. For a Diego \""Signature\"" dish, I was a bit disappointed. The plantains were the worst I've ever tasted. They were dry and not very tastey. \n\nThough the food was not very good, the service was great. But I definitely would not eat here again."
0,"I have been to this school a few times to take tests and they way they do things is very old fashion I must say for Vegas. Computers I thought were taking over the world? Well I hope so since that is where my career lies.\n\nSo you do your paperwork at the front which is filled with young adults that don't really know what they are doing. They sit there and ask each other for help. I don't know what that is all about. Do they get paid or this is for credits? \n\nThey make you fill out paperwork and then send you over to the cashier. The cashier knows what they are doing at least. Then the cashier gives you a piece of paper, saying you paid for your test and then you walk back over to the front desk to show them the piece of paper. Is anyone following how time consuming and old fashion this is? \n\nOk so I move to a different address. I know I have to be there early so I can change my address before my test. I give proof of address with a bill in hand but they say I don't need that. So then I give my I.D. to them which also has my new address on it. He takes it and goes scans it, I guess to put it in my file. They make me filled out new paperwork. Then once that is all done I head to the testing room, and even tell the teacher I have a new address. She writes it down. On my test, it asks if I had any changes since my last test, and there's a option for new address. I check it. I even filled it out on the test. Now I am pretty confident my results will get to my new address.\n\nOne month later, I still haven't gotten my results in the mail yet. I was patient enough and decided to call to see what was going on. The young male adult that answered the phone kept putting me on hold to look for my test and when I took it. \n\nSo he finds my paperwork and starts reading off my old address. I started laughing in frustration. I explained what I went through, that morning to make sure everything was going to be sent to me. I wasn't mean or nasty with him.  laughed a lot thought because I couldn't believe this was happening. I asked if he could changed it over the phone and that was of course no. I must go back to the school and change my address and also get my test results there too. \n\nSo my scanning of my I.D. was missing, and all the new sheets I filled out were just gone? He also tells me that he would of remember scanning my I.D. because he was there that day of the test. \n\nI hung up on him. I couldn't take it anymore. He made me look like I was lying. How frustrating is that. \n\nSo I am still in the unknown about my results. I haven't been able to make it down to the school since I don't have a car. It's really not easy to get to in my situation. \n\nI am finding another school quickly. Will not give them anymore of my money!!  \n\nThanks CSN for all the drama."
0,"Came here later in the evening on a weekday to an empty building. No host/ess, no wandering servers, no customers... We had to search the place for someone to seat us and the first people we ran into were a couple of off-duty servers who were rolling silverware. The male kindly sat us and got our drinks for us. It took a ridiculously long time for our server to even appear at our table and just as long for our food to come out. To make everything worse, the only other couple in the restaurant who were sitting behind us were complaining to the server about their food. The server returned to their table a bit later (no manager) and said that \""the manager\"" told him that since the food is made early in the day, it can lose texture and flavor by the time it is served. WHAT? Seriously???? It was hard to enjoy our food at all by the time it arrived.\n\nThe food left much the be desired. The service was the worst I've ever encountered. I don't usually leave complaints on restaurant websites but I had to leave one for this terrible visit. They gave us a coupon for a free appetizer. Needless to say we did not return to redeem it."
0,"We just stopped by for a cup of coffee. To my disappointment two cups if coffee were 8.19. I thought that might be a decent price for a pour over but the girl walked over to a thermos and poured our coffee. It's disappointing to pay four dollars for a cup of coffee that you don't know when it was made. \n\nThe place is cute but I can't see it topping LGO, it doesn't make sense to pay those prices when there are so many other great options close within reach. \n\nI gave two stars because the service was friendly."
1,Just came in today with some coins my father left me. I went in with a moderate idea of what I could get based on some internet research. After he looked at them I got DOUBLE what I thought I was going to get. The man who helped me was very nice and told me about the coins I brought in and how to care for any future ones I gather. The shop is small wth a huge selection of other older coins I was really impressed. Overall the transaction was pleasant and informative versus some other places that I have gone to. Will be going again. Thanks a lot.
1,"When my flight landed early, the driver Ben called me to say that he knew of the early arrival and when I got my bag to give him a call.  After I picked up my luggage, I called him and he was already at the terminal pickup.  The driver was pleasant, courteous, friendly and drove safely.  The car was clean and roomy.  He handled my luggage door to door.  I plan on using the service to get back to the airport.  I highly recommend this company and driver."
1,"What a pleasant little Thai restaurant tucked into the Sansone Parkplace off the strip. My family and I stopped by for lunch and were immediately impressed by the beautiful decor and classy interior. \n\nSince it was a holiday, the lunch specials were not available; however, they are usually available Monday - Friday from 11am - 3pm and only $7.95 for an entree, soup, egg roll & fried wonton. What a great deal! \n\nSince we ordered from the regular menu, I tried the pad Thai w/ tofu for $9.95 and my parents tried the spicy mint beef w/ rice. Spice levels range from 1-10: order 4 for a mild spice. The food was pretty delicious! We were impressed with the flavors and portion sizes given the reasonable prices. \n\nThe service was excellent. Our waiter, Bon, was perfectly hospitable and polite and we had a constant stream of servers stopping by to refill our water and ask if we needed anything else. \n\nI would definitely recommend this Thai restaurant if you're looking for authentic, reasonably-priced Thai food in a classy environment off the strip."
1,"I was on my own, wanted just a glass of wine and an appetizer. I was at the NC Music Factory to hear The Hot Gates play on the outside stage. The Bask patio was a perfect location for watching and listening.  I was welcomed warmly and was treated very well even though they knew I was a \""small ticket\"" table. The black bean hummus with toasted pita and baby vegetables appetizer was flavorful and abundant. I will definitely go back for a full meal."
1,"After going to see Thunder From Down Under, my girl friends and I decided to hit up this Irish pub to unwind. I love Irish pubs and this one was just a bit more special because during the band, a dancer came out on a tiny table off to the side and  danced for a tiny portion of the song. I didn't get a beer, but I did try their popular beer, which was light and pretty tasty. I'll definitely be coming back here!"
1,"I grew up in Las Vegas. I was not introduced to the concept of \""Last Call\"" until I moved to Ohio at 17 years old. It was a huge shock. I couldn't believe other people had the right to tell me when I could or couldn't purchase delicious alcoholic beverages. Despite the fact that I was 17 years old and I was therefore legally forbidden to buy alcoholic beverages for at least another 3 years, this \""Last Call\"" business really chapped me.\n\nI'm typically not ready to end the night just because Mr. Last Call wants to be a party pooper and rear his ugly head. I usually plan for this likely event beforehand, but I'm not going to say I'm a stranger to jumping in a cab at 1:50 screaming at the driver with the urgency some may reserve for labor pains that I need a liquor store PRONTO! This leads to me overpaying for the cab, overpaying for liquor, and generally overtesting my patience because apparently to some cab drivers \""PRONTO\"" means \""Drive Safely and Obey all Posted Speed Limits\"". Pussies.\n\nThis, my friends, is where the beauty of a liquor store with a built-in bar comes in. This way, when last call comes around, I merely need to mosey on down the hall to make my after-hours selection, and patiently ask my cab driver to take me to the destination of my choice. Everybody wins!\n\nThe bar has a great selection of beers on draft. On our last visit, which just happened to be Halloween night, there was not one but TWO different Pumpkin drafts. The ever popular Four Peaks Pumpkin Porter, and another one which I don't quite remember the name of, but it tasted like pumpkin pie in a pint glass. I was tempted to ask for whipped cream. \n\nWe experimented with several different beverages throughout the course of the night. I awoke the next morning to find a note written to myself in my phone that merely said:\n\nlos abbey angel share is the most delciousber of allll time\n\nAs you can clearly read, Lost Abbey Angel's Share is the most delicious beer of all time. They serve it here, for $13 a glass. It's totally worth it though. It's extremely strong and tastes like a combination of chocolate and jesus. Another win-win.\n\nI'll definitely be back to Taste of Tops. Cab drivers everywhere rejoice."
0,"I have been a regular for years and I really like the place.  But last night was a disaster from start to finish.  The waiter had no business being a waiter.  The food took quite a while and came out lukewarm.  All of it.  The main dishes, the rice and the nan.  I made them aware and they brought back another round of dishes they claimed to be fresh, not just original dishes heated up.  Same temperature and virtually no spiciness.  We are usually asked how spicy we like our food.  The waiter never bothered to ask us.\n\nIt was as if the place changed ownership and the new team was that day trying to figure out how to cook and run a restaurant.  I made management aware and received 10% off the bill.  Still not sure when or if I'll be back."
1,"Today I just went to ATL Wings Your Way in Gilbert, by Filibertos.\nI must say, I was pleasently surprised to be greated by the owner, Tony Yates, He welcomed us into his restaurant and asked if we had been there before. We said yes to ATL Wings in Chandler but never this store. He then said that this store is the corporate store and not a franchise whereas the ATL Wings in Chandler is a franchise. This store has fewer wing sauce choices for a reason.  This store has the original 9 sauces that the owner invented. ATL Wings in Chandler has non corporate sauces which explains the difference. I ate the 6 wing combo plus fries and a fountain coke. It was $6.49. I ordered the HOT wings and they did have a little heat to them but not over the top but good. It also did include celery and cool ranch sauce. They were very tender and perfectly sauced. I enjoyed every bite. I didn't order any dessert but I assume they are good too judged on the wings. Also, they are now offering Ribs (Half and Full Racks) on Friday & Saturdays ONLY. I plan to go on a Friday or Saturday to try them out, and I can only imagine that they would be just as good if not better than their wings. If you are in the area of Mcqueen and Elliot Rds. in Gilbert drop by and check them out. In my opinion they are worth it."
1,"Went in last night for the Yelp Event and was very pleased. Food was great, service was pleasant, and we had an overall good experience. Loved the outside patio too! Ballantyne is a little far for me but I'd definitely go again if I was in the area."
1,"Best dog park hands down. Believe me I would know ive been to all of em in town but they dont have anything on this park. The dog park is on the corner of eatern and warm springs and there are 2 sections: dogs up to 35lbs & 35lbs and up. I take teddy to the 35lbs and under and its usually the same regulars and their dogs that I see there which is great. Everyone knows each other, cleans up after their dogs, help clean water bowls, they are even a few people who make rounds around the park with a pooper scooper just making sure to pick up anything someone may have missed. Most dogs are friendly I have yet to see a fight break out just the occasional snapping at each other with a growl. No big deal. Safe enough and the dogs love it!!! Theres usually someone there at all times of the day but most people go at 6:30am-7:30am and 6:30-7:30pm. Oh and a lot of dog parks dont have any grass this one does so thats also a plus :)"
1,"I am not much of a mexican food fan, but this was a very nice restaurant that had a lot of variety.  Besides the waiter accidentally spilling a margarita (which was very tasty) on a person in our party, the service was excellent.\n\nThe pork was wonderful.  The shrimp tacos were absolutely delectable!  The chips were fresh and pleantiful.  Salsas were very good also.\n\nI can't believe how busy it got while we were there.  Obviously a hot spot in this part of town.  I can see why."
0,"Oh my goodness. My friends and I came here at 12:20am, and there's only one server. Which is no problem to me bc I am a waitress as well and I know sometimes 1 server can handle smaller restaurants when it's not during peak hours. But wow, was I wrong. Our female server just did everything sooooo slow. She took our drinks late, our order late, everything. The way she prioritized the order of the things she needs to do was just terrible. Halfway through my meal (bacon slam burger & chicken tenders were delicious tho! Thanks to the cook), I needed another sauce of honey mustard. She only checked on our table ONCE and I asked for my extra cup of honey mustard & refills for our waters. Then she goes to the register to process a LARGE party who has multiple checks first before she gets us our simple water refills & sauce. That took about 15 mins, so by the time she came back w/ our stuff, my chicken tenders were cold already and my 2 other friends has already finished their meals (lumberjack slam & Belgian waffle slam). Ugh I've never written a review let alone had such bad service that I had to write my first one. Such horrible service. Management, please train your servers to be better."
1,"I have NEVER been here when the weather was warm enough to go out onto the fabled patio.  Am I missing something?  How awesome can a patio be?  I'm sure I'll make my way there eventually, but for now I can only imagine the wonders said outdoor patio holds.\n\nRound Corner Cantina is pretty good indoors too.  My relationship with Round Corner Cantina is simple & pure. If I'm breathing, then I want tacos.  They have good tacos, and they'll bring tacos to my table in a friendly fashion.\n\nThey've got good cocktails, good beer, and I think they are reasonably priced.  They have fun drink specials.\n\nI like coming here for food, I don't know if I'd come here to hang out because I feel like I'm too old for their crowd  ...although their lack of lighting could help me blend in.  In the one back room, its really dark.  \n\nSo if you're on a date with someone who is not exactly a feast for the eyes, take them here.  There's tacos and it's dark.  Your situation will immediately be improved 100%.\n\ntip:  this place is ALWAYS packed.  If you LOVE to sit during happy hour, I recommend getting here early to stake your claim to a seat."
0,"Service sucked and food was mediocre. We went on a weeknight to avoid crowds and there were only a few people in the restaurant - that should have been a clue! 4 people were seated at a teppanyaki table that sat 10-12 but the host said we had to have a reservation for teppanyaki.  Later on the 2nd teppanyaki table opened up for two people.  I have no idea why we were not permitted to sit at either teppanyaki table when they were mostly empty.  Our service was awful! Ordering entrees over $25 each, I expect quality service.  Rather than going around to the other side of the table, the waiter passed me my son's soup, salad and fork. Did not box our food after dinner and brought our check while chewing his own dinner! Food was just ok. I can get the same quality food at our neighborhood restaurant for 1/3 the price. And the iced tea tasted like instant tea.  The entire experience was very disappointing!"
1,"I didn't know what to expect from The Soup Factory, but I liked what I found! I visited around noon on a weekday and the place was hopping with what seemed to be a local business crowd. I ordered the Cheesy Caprese sandwich and loved it. I sampled some of the soups as well and all were good, but maybe not great. There are about 8 different varieties of soup to choose from each day, everything from different chilis to stews to bisques--you won't get bored. And a regular menu of salads and sandwiches is available. Friendly, hard-working staff."
1,This is on the SOUTHEAST corner by the walgreens. Not the north east as the map shows.
0,"Been to a lot of nail spas. I would say this one is one of the worst. To start they do not use plastic liners on their soaking tubs. Second although they do a decent job on your standard pedi. Im just not too impressed. They lacked the quality work of an experienced manicurist. We like getting our ingrowns removed and if your not skillful you can be in a world of hurt. The chairs are dated and I dont understand why the nice 42\"" flat panel tv is on the back of the customers. They have a nice 12\"" tube tv for the customers. But my advice if you like quality work this may not be the place for you. If you like cheap you get what you pay for. I wont even bother coming back."
0,"This is kind of a weird review because it's for Gap products but not actually about this store specifically.\n\nThis is about Gap's maternity clothes. Back in the day when Gap had two stores on Princes St, there was actually a maternity section.  Actually having said that there is a vague bell ringing in the back of my head which suggests that this store may actually carry maternity. I'd say I need to check that out but...\n\nI discovered recently that Gap doesn't size their maternity clothes in a normal way.  Specifically, I think they size them to make women think that they've not gained weight.  That's all well in good if you fancy tricking yourself into thinking you've not changed a size, but it's less good for those of us who genuinely haven't, and buy their normal size on good faith that the clothes will actually fit.  And they basically do, for the first 30 minutes, until they stretch out and you're left hauling your trousers up every 10 steps because, despite your swelling stomach, your clothes are STILL too big.  \n\nIt's a shame because my cords are genuinely cute, when they're yanked up to where they should sit.  \n\nSo, although I kept the two pairs of trousers and one top I bought from here, I'm not entirely pleased with them. The trousers are baggy and the top is also too large. How about we all just deal with weight gain instead of having stores make up crazy enormous sizes that don't fit?"
1,The best hole I. The wall Chinese place I've ever had. Great to. Pick up and take home. They are super fast getting your food together and my order is always right!
0,Overpriced and it tastes like frozen powder. The only reason they're in business is because they're the only frozen yogurt place in the Mirage Hotel. Save your money for a Gelato at the Venetian or the Bellagio.
1,"As a lover of all food Thai...this place takes the cake for the best I ever had! While at Commonwealth, we smelled something good. I asked the security guard what it could be & he pointed in Le Thai's direction, right next door. \n\nWe ordered the Thai style wings with sriracha sauce, & pork Pad See Ew. I've had Pad See Ew all over town, & hands down...Le Thai has the best! The noodles had a sweetness to it & they even serve it with a fried egg on top. Something we haven't has anywhere else. The wings were fried perfectly & the sriracha sauce was delicious. \n\nCan't wait to go back! Yum!"

0,"Just here on vacation with my family. Stopped by here because they're craving asian food. Ordered a burger and ate it half way through looking okay until it was literally raw beef. It wasn't rare. Just literally raw.  \n\nIt was a struggle getting a refund after waiting awhile and the manager or whoever was managing that day didn't apologize. :/. \n\nThe girls were nice though, thanks. \n\nBoba tea was awesome though."
1,"We had breakfast here while staying at the Four Seasons.  Everything was delicious.  I had the french toast with a side of bacon and it was absoluted devine.  The applewood smoked bacon was cooked perfectly.  The service was excellent and the restaurant itself was beautiful.  There was indoor and outdoor seating - we chose indoors.  It was not the least bit cramped and you could actually enjoy your meal and conversation without feeling as though you were eavesdropping on the people sitting nearby.\n\nThe only reason I can't give it 5 stars is the price, but it was the Four Seasons, so I expected it.  Thankfully we stayed there in the middle of summer, so we got a fantastic deal on the hotel, which allowed us to splurge a bit.  Otherwise, I don't think I would have spent $60 on breakfast for 2 people."
0,"At first, we had to wait to sit in a booth, which wasn't a big deal. Then, we had to wait for our server to come over and get our drinks. Considering this was during a slow lunch, waiting 10 minutes for the server to come over and introduce herself was a bit ridiculous. We ordered the calamari as an appetizer, which comes with a tomato sauce on the side. When we finally got our appetizer, there was no sauce. I asked the waitress (who I will not name) if it came with the marinara sauce. She gave us a curt, \""no, it's not served with anything.\"" And then asked if we would like ranch to dip the calamari in. I grabbed a menu, just to make sure that I hadn't read anything wrong, and sure enough it says that the calamari was served with a warm pomodoro sauce. I got another waiter's attention to get the sauce (after ours ignored my attempts to get her attention), and our waitress got very snotty and butted in. All we wanted was the sauce that was served with our appetizer... The salads we ordered were good, and after we got a little rude with the waitress, she spent the rest of our meal trying to make up for her rudeness. \nI will not be returning to this location."

1,"Fun stuff!  My raft flipped taking all 8 of us (includes guide) overboard.  A few of us had some cuts from bumping up against the rocks.  It would have been nice if the guide had directed us to the first aid area after we finished...but we had to go find antibiotic ointment and bandaids on our own.  Other than that, I'd do it again."
1,"My wife and I just did the West Rim Grand Canyon VIP tour today.  We had a wonderful time.  Tour guide Jody was awesome.  One of the best guides we every had.  We paid the extra $20 for the food and was very pleased.  Good value for the $.  Stop at Hoover Dam was quick, but nice.  Gave us a chance for some nice pics.  We did the optional Skywalk which we felt was worth it.  A little pricey, but a cool experience.\n\nThis tour is a great way to see the West Rim of the Grand Canyon.\n\nBased on today, we would definitely do a Comedy on Deck Tour again, especially if we would have Jody as our guide."
0,uhm i get that im in vegas and things cost more...but ROFL WOW. theres a reasonable point in paying for something. \n\nto be dramatic...its like paying 10$ for a piece of gum.
0,"Paid for an unlimited wristband and it ended up being a complete waste of $70 to those who are already VIP members at the hotel. The gaudy manager who goes by the name Art Pepper gave awful service to guests. His tone of voice was uncalled for. The cashier with bad makeup who goes by the name \""Sasha\"" gave a snarky attitude to the guests as well. They need to reevaluate the way they treat their guests at this hotel. I can get better service at a Burger King drive-thru."
0,"I had been really excited to try this restaurant because the menu looked so good, but I was quite disappointed. I went there for dinner on the 4th of July with my husband and mother-in-law. The food was pretty mediocre. The decor seemed cheap (also keep in mind that it's located in a hotel). Our server was rushing us the whole time, serving our dinner while we were still eating our appetizers, asking if we wanted dessert menus when we were still eating our entrees... She was very nice, but in too much of a hurry, and she also forgot the beer my husband ordered. Would not go back here."

1,"This place is fantastic.  Great atmosphere, and a really cool ilttle bar.  The food was superb.  \nWe didn't have a reservation, but they were able to seat us right away.  Probably because the room they placed us in was filled by an uber-obnoxious group, about 3 sheets to the wind (drunk).  Even they couldn't. Ruin this wonderful meal.\nThey start u with veggies and a generous bread plate.  Like almost all the places we went in Madison, they had excellent cocktails.  We ordered the frog legs (best I ever had) and the corn soup (yummy)to start.\nI ordered the sirloin, and it was great, one of the better steaks I've had.  My buddy got the rack of lamb.  It was excellent.  Luckily the portion was big enought o share.  \nA great place.  I wish I could give it 6 stars."
0,"I do not recommend coming to Fat Dumplings at all. \n1.We waited for our food over an hour (we came in at 1:45 and our main dish came out around 3 which is unbelievable)\n2.The dumplings were alright but it took forever for them to serve their foods because they are short of staff, you even have to ask for water yourself\n3.The teriyaki chicken was especially terrible, obviously lack of cooking skill, not to mention the sauce itself. On top of that It tastes like micowave-food. \n4. Pork chop rice was plain, tasteless, and the meat was hard as rock. \nI am not a picky person but this restaurant disappointed me. The food is not worth of the price. \n\n\nPS I'm Asian but I dont approve this restaurant AT ALL. You could spend the money anywhere else than here. The only thing worth praising is their decently hygiene d restroom."
1,"Good work, fair prices, friendly people."
0,"AWFUL!!!  Too bad you can't post without a star.  However, please consider going here if you:\n1.  Want it to take 40 minutes to get your food. \n2.  Don't care that when you look around the restaurant and see 10 other people, and management uses the excuse of \""they're busy\"" as to why your food took so long. \n3.  Don't care that they tell you there is a big VIP party behind the wall and that's why your food was late. \n4.  Love being told by incompetent management that the kitchen is slow because of a VIP party, behind the wall. (You should NEVER give another paying customer that excuse. It's not MY problem. I don't want to know of any problems when I've decided to come to your restaurant as a paying customer. Run a tight ship!  I don't want to hear it!)\n5.  Want to feel privileged that they are going to take a whole whopping $8 off our meal because it took sooooo long. \n6.  Want a free dessert offered by same incompetent manager, as a courtesy for taking sooooo long. This AFTER she was told TWICE we can't do dessert, because the kids have to go to bed. \n7.  Love having a wait staff that doesn't understand the importance of getting kids in and out. \n\nThe list could go on, but my husband and I were appalled. To note, our sushi was \""stringy\"" and the edamame was WAY over cooked. The Filet we ordered was for our 2 kids, which the waiter knew. No sense of urgency just TONS of idiotic excuses.  But hey, we got $8 off!  \n\nWe will not go back!  \n\nWAY TOO MANY OTHER GREAT CHOICES FOR SUSHI IN LAS VEGAS!!!!\n\nSushi Fever...here we come!!!"
1,"Been here many times & absolutely love the food!! The unlimited fresh pitas with garlic humus is excellent & worth the dine-in experience if u are prepared for poor service! Don't get me wrong, food is always great, but service is always poor. You can go when it's busy, when it's quiet, they always manage to forget to bring water, bills. Well worth the food! Choose take out if u want good service."
1,"I'd been to Settebello once before and finally made it back last night with my husband and another couple, and we all really enjoyed our meals. The service was great, and I love the Italian decor. They don't take reservations on the weekend, but we had no problem getting a table. Here's the food breakdown:\n\nCaprese salad - awesome! They really know what they're doing with this salad. We ordered it at another pizzeria in town last weekend and it was just so-so. Settebello really got it right. Mmm.\n\nDiavola Pizza - We shared this since we were getting dessert, too. This was really good. It has a bit of a kick to it, but not too bad. I love the fresh mozzarella, and the crust is so chewy and good!\n\nNutella Pizza - This was a big reason why I'd been wanting to go back. We saw it on the menu last time we went but exercised some self control, and I've been thinking about it ever since! It has an awesome presentation and just looks delicious, and it tasted delicious, too! Our friends got the La Bomba (caramel surrounded by peanut butter gelato coated in chocolate), which was also delicious. \n\nWe will definitely be back!"
0,"This has been my go to car wash since it opened well over 15 years and boy has it gone down hill. \n\nToday I arrived at 12:20pm with only one other car waiting in the ticket writing/vacuum area. There was one guy vacuuming the other car and 4 others standing there. Each, at some point in my ridiculous 5+minute wait for my ticket to be written, came over to offer me an oil change, a wind shield replacement, fuel etc but not one could write a ticket. Finally the magic ticket writer appeared and wrote my ticket. \n\nMy car went through the car wash in sub 3 minutes as it was out before I was done paying and it was evident how 'fabulous' of a job they did on the vacuuming. Clearly nothing had been done but I was just over this whole experience.\n\nWaiting outside in this lovely 105+ heat, I noticed they have turned their misters off as well. Great customer experience and satisfaction...not! The inside was barely wiped down but I didn't want to spend one more minute here. Also, while I was inside the cashier was very sweet and when I commented that they needed more ticket writers, she agreed. Not sure how Danny's expects to increase sales if you can't even get a ticket written! Better yet, how about they cross train one of the 4 guys standing around doing nothing to write a ticket in a timely manner. \n\nAs a final note, when I pulled away I went left, not right as most people do and saw 5 more Danny's employees hanging out under a tree. Guess I know where all everyone went. Later Danny's!"
0,"I'll have to go with Mr. K on this one, a definite pass.  There are three other hookah lounges all within a half mile of Oasis and they are all worlds better than this one.  Go to Urban Cafe or even King Tuts, just anywhere but here. \n\nThe food is mediocre, nothing stood out one way or the other.  The music was a little annoying, but I'm not really into pop music or hip-hop, but I suppose people who are would enjoy it.  However, the service is absolutely terrible.  I've been there twice and on both occasions the (extremely late) delivery of food saved me from walking out the door.  Their hookahs are not good, and you practically have to tackle an employee if you want more coals.\n\nSave yourself the frustration and go to Urban Cafe or King Tuts.  Urban is a bit more for the mediterranean loving, less-frills crowd.  Tuts if you still like your hip-hop and being surrounded by ASU students."
0,I was in LV for the night and did a yelp search for the best Thai in the area and this place popped up.  I ended up ordering several things off the menu to-go.  Overall it took a long time for the order to be ready.  The customer in front of me said she had been there for over an hour and her meal still wasn't ready.  So that was a negative.  Got back to our hotel and tried all the dishes.  Overall they were ok to pretty bad.  Not even close to the quality of Thai we have in Seattle.  I am not sure why this place has such a good rating...
0,"Apparently there are 2 names to this place. Clearly the marketing in that was well thought out....  re-posting what I already wrote---\n\nI vomited in the bathroom mid lunch. If that wasn't enough to stop making you eat here... I'll list some more reasons-\n\nAgadashi tofu was more like watered down teriyaki sauce with a side of tofu mush.\n\nTempura with no tempura sauce, and it tasted old.\n\nWaitress dropped an entire tray of ice water on my mom and didn't even apologize.\n\nThe best part was the table behind us with young children screaming... while the parentals were sake bombing like 18 year olds.\n\nClearly... a classy place if you ask me.\n\nBTW, if you honestly give this place more than 3 stars, I really question your taste palate."
1,"Great new spot in the east valley! My coworkers and I went here for lunch the week before Christmas. We made a reservation as we wanted to be sure we could have lunch in the allotted lunch hour, and they let us place our food orders ahead of time. (If you've ever tried to do a group lunch in this Superstition area in an hour, you know what I'm talking about.) When we arrived, the server took drink orders and began bringing out salads, followed by soups. Pretty much everything on the lunch menu comes with a salad and soup, which makes for plenty of food! The lunch prices were great too, ranging from $7-12, including the teppanyaki dishes. I had 2 maki rolls and both were delicious and fresh. Definitely a place we will do lunch again!"
1,"Great food, great service, and great atmosphere.  Family friendly, with owners that care about their business and their customers!"
1,"I love that Japan is a world of nonsense and absurdity. I fully embrace things like a restaurant only playing ABBA. And if that is what you are looking for, then Tokyo Japanese Restaurant completely delivers on that front. The sushi and other dishes are all solid, but nothing really blew me away. And for that reason, if it was not for the great and friendly service (and the ABBA), I would give this joint three stars. The service was so spot-on, with all of the staff willing to help out on anything you may need. We went with the all-you-can-eat menu, which has a great variety of apps, dishes, and sushi. At $27 a person, it is a fairly decent deal, and let's you order at will. Insider Tip: If you are the height of a normal American male, watch your head on the hanging lanterns."
0,Not real impressed. Walked in because I was at the Smiths next door and thought it would be a quick in and out. Nope. Not only are they slow. They are rude. They have a Chinese movie blasting on the TV and everyone is just lounging around. My tech was in the phone for the first 10 minutes. No effort to conversate. The chair was broken and his massage was horrible.  Two of the best part of a pedi...FAIL.
1,"I have to say, when my friend told me about the pool where girls can go topless, I was all for it. (I wish we could've stop by there earlier on our trip)\n\nMonday came around and my friend & I was still in Vegas. She told me weeks before our trip that she wanted to check out the Bare Pool place on Monday before we left. She asked if I would like to join her. (F yeah!)\n\nThis Bare Pool is located in the Mirage. We got slightly lost looking for the spot. Finally we arrived and through some miracle (and my friend's charm) we got in for free. We got there at around 1PM so there were the perfect amount of people: not too busy, not too slow.\n\nWe did what we normally did: bathroom stop, off with the covers, and walk right back out. I saw down for a bit in the pool. I tried out the environment first. I felt pretty chill and comfortable after a few minutes then off my bikini top goes. I didn't feel like people were staring, just simply relaxing at the pool having a good time. I think I was the 2nd person there to go topless. I thought it was a little surprising since it was Las Vegas; I figure everyone there are more bold then me. (I guess not! lol)\n\nWe stayed there for a few hours to get rid of out tan lines we had for the past few days at the pool parties.\n\nAbout 4PM people started to show up. I guess I felt like the obnoxious crowded started to fill up the spot. Why did I feel that way you say? There were scattered drunk individuals who were obnoxiously loud. I started to feel like I was at a nightclub in Downtown San Jose. I sat up most of the time and just scanned the area. I guess my friend notice that I'm starting to feel uncomfortable so she said, \""lets go.\"" \n\nThis pool was a perfect spot for you to wine down from a hectic weekend and go topless... before 4PM on a Monday.\n\nYou should stop by here at least once when you're in town. =]"
1,I called Macias Landscaping because I got a letter from the town of Tempe saying they were going to fine me because of my palm trees being overgrown. They were able to come out the day after I called them and was even able to come particularly early because of my work schedule. The palm trees look great and I really appreciated the quick response and fast service. I would definitely recommend Macias to anyone needing their palms trimmed.
1,"This is definitely one of the more expensive and classier restaurants in downtown Pittsburgh. I came during restaurant week with a group which was a perfect opportunity for me to try multiple things here.\n\nI honestly don't remember what the entree I ordered tasted like, but my crab salad appetizer was a great start to the meal. Pleasantly, the crab to salad ratio was higher on the crab end. It was dressed with a vinaigrette giving the whole salad a very crisp and fresh flavor.\n\nThe best part of the meal was the dessert. That probably made me forget what the entree tasted like. Since I came with a group I was able to try their Chocolate Mousse Tart and Capuccunio Torte. Both were rich, chocolaty, and addicting. The Torte also came with this delicious oreo-cookie like crust. \n\nOne plus for this restaurant is you can get your parking garage ticket waived. Free parking in Pittsburgh is a win."
0,"Messed up my whole order, the drink they gave me was watered down they also never gave me my receipt! Never going to this location ever again."
1,YUM! Hubby and I split the blue cheese burger and we added duck bacon.  Wished after the fact that we had both ordered our own! The sticky toffee pops where also delish!
1,"This place is very cool for little treasures and fun gifts, and it has the coolest owner.  I met her while shopping one day, and I will have to say that the service in a business is critical as a shopper who doesn't like to be ignored until it is nearing closing time, and then all of a sudden here come the staff to let you know they are closing in ten mins (my sister's closet who also lock the doors with customers still inside-not actually legal ladies)  Service and selection of unique trinkets and fun accessories with a lovely selection for Believers."
1,"Utter deliciousness-every bite, every thing, every time.  I have been coming here for years and I am amazed at how good it is every time. Fresh home made rolls, high quality beef or chicken, quality cheeses make an amazing sandwich, and the fries, oh my goodness soooo good, especially the sweet Potato.  The fry sauce is a must but if you like ranch, ask  for some on the side, hause made and best on the planet.no joke-I would have it as my drink if I could afford the calories.  Employee turn over is low so they must take care of the staff,  and the owner is usually there, working just as hard as every one else.  Thanks for an amazing lunch."
0,"There's probably a reason no one has reviewed this show yet.  It's definitely not a destination show.  It's one of Vegas' cheesy magic/acrobatics shows that's showing at 4:00 pm every afternoon and is definitely \""family\"" (little kid) oriented.  Ai and YuKi are the hosts/stars and are somewhat following a plot of battling an evil character called Tengu.  The duo are pretty well versed at all the magic tricks that I learned the secrets of while watching PBS specials as a kid.  The performances are a large step beyond cheesy, enough so that we were a bit annoyed.  The highlight of the show were the associated acrobatics.  An aerial gymnast captured our attention and made my friend gasp out loud a couple of times.  I hope they include health insurance in her contract, yikes..."
1,"The food was good but not fantastic. We got a lot of items. The desserts looked beautiful and interesting but we didn't get any. The fig cheesecake was especially intriguing. We got shawarma wraps, falafel, the flavor savor combination with jasmines rice, lentil soup, hummus, and a pita pitza for our baby. The pitza was borderline yucky. The cheese was flavorless and she wouldn't eat it after the first bite. It needs some work. Maybe if it was fresh it'd be better but we did take it to go. The hummus really does need more flavor. More garlic maybe, I'm not sure. But, it is saved by the hot sauce that they make! It's outstanding! As is the garlic sauce. The shawarma wraps were good, especially with garlic sauce and hot sauce! The flavor savor was a nice representation of their food but I felt like some of my chicken was missing, like it was supposed to be a whole thigh but was only like half a thigh. The beef was good but I'm certain it was previously frozen. The falafel were fine although a tad salty and potentially previously frozen. It did satisfy our desire for Mediterranean flavors and we'll give it another try for sure. The restaurant was very clean and the ladies that helped me, including the Manager, were both very friendly and helpful."
0,"I may edit this review at some point in time because I've heard a lot of great things about this venue. But one thing I want to really point out is that John and Eric (two short asian guys) are the worst and most unprofessional bouncers ever. First they accidentally let in the wrong girls in with us and left out our other half of our groups, clearly those extra girls who got in with us are obviously not with us, then we let them know, and they don't even own up to their mistake and complain that we are wasting their time and give us 10 seconds to gather our group of 40 people. Are you kidding me? If you can't maintain your attitude and problem solve then find a new gig, don't be rude."
1,"Have a really cool dinner tonight, i got the sushi and BBQ. The sushi is fresh rice with a big piece of fresh fish on top,  BBQ are fresh and taste sweet. Server with shiny smile they teach me how to do the BBQ help me a lot, I am happy to having a delicious food in this wonderful restaurant ."
1,"Picking up the car was quick and the car was great. Checking back in at the end of the rental was fast. Since it was covered by insurance, paperwork was minimal."

1,"I haven't actually purchased a car at this particular Carmax, but I have come here on several occasions with others who have been in the market for cars. I actually really like the Carmax experience. The worst part about car shopping to me is negotiating on price. That's what I like about Carmax. You walk in and you're free to browse the inventory at your leisure and there are salespeople ready to help whenever you need them. Each time I've come here shopping with friends the sales associates have been friendly, helpful and most importantly... patient.\n\nThey have a big inventory and what's even better if there is a vehicle at another Carmax across the nation they can get that to your local dealership if you request it. Within 250 miles there is no cost and they charge a service fee for any that are at dealerships that are a little further from your current location. \n\nThe web site is pretty easy to navigate as well. You can keep an eye out for the car you've got your eye out for or even set up alerts for a particular year, make and or model that you are looking for and they will let you know when it's available. Definitely the way I like to car shop."
0,"In its heyday (80s and 90s) I would have given it 4 stars, but it just doesn't have that mall energy or buzz any more. It has too many cheap specialty shops. The best thing about this mall is it is a cool place to go in the summer. It needs some serious updating to be more relevant to the times. However, my son loves the play area and \""choo-choo\""."

0,"We were very excited to try this restaurant and went there on Saturday night for my husband's birthday. After reading a lot of the Yelp reviews, I was looking forward to the food and was concerned about the poor service many before us reviewed.\n\nWell as you may guess by the rating, neither the food or the service was up to par. In my opinion, one of the very best things a restaurant can do to ensure its success is to make sure their servers are knowledgeable, gracious, super efficient & personable. If I'd had that, I'd probably give the food another chance. \n\nThe most glaring failure during order taking was asking if we wanted bread or frites with our mussels and failing to mention when my husband said frites that he would again be served French fries with his brisket sandwich. Who seriously needs 2 orders of fries during 1 service? Our first beers we ordered off the bar menu were served in cans - that's an inexcusable restaurant decision that I wish they had made more obvious on that bar menu. Seriously, it's a gastropub not a tailgate!  Draft beers were not mentioned by our server and had we not read the board on the other side of the bar and done an online search for the beer's description, we wouldn't have known they existed or what they were. She had no idea about any of the drafts when we asked.\n\nSo many things on the menu were appealing we decided to order 4 items. We started with the smoked wings (recommended highly by other Yelpers) and the curry mussels. I got the feeling if we hadn't specified to our server that we considered the final 2 items to be our entrees, that all 4 items would have shown up at our ridiculously tiny table for 2 at once. When the 2 appetizers arrived at once we had to pile everything on top of each other because the table didn't have room for 2 appetizers plus 2 small appetizer plates. The wings were actually really delicious with a nice smokey flavor and turned out to be  the highlight of the meal. The mussels were nicely sized and plentiful but the curry sauce was sorely lacking in flavor. \n\nThen our server disappeared for 20 minutes, stopped by to tell us she was sorry about our wait but our food would be up in 1 minute, then disappeared for 25 additional minutes. My husband found her scurrying by long enough to tell her to please cancel the rest of our food if it wasn't already sitting in the back. She disappeared for another 5 minutes and appeared with only my husband's brisket sandwich which came with more frites. She squeezed into the tiny space between us & the next table and informed me that my short rib flatbread had hit the floor as she was racing it to our table but that they had started another one and it would be done in 7 minutes. Not sure why the first one couldn't come out in 45 if it only took 7 to cook. \n\nNeither the brisket nor the flatbread were very good and unfortunately our attitudes toward Meat & Potatoes weren't either by the end of the evening."
0,"OMG if i could give this place a negative star i would. $8 for a turkey sandwich which consist of 2 slices of bread,turkey meat, and lettuce.Pickle on the side and a packet of mayo. 7-11 makes better sandwiches.So disappointed.Subway was so much better.Went to panda express afterwards (food court next to M&M world) and was more satisfied and cost even less.Pay $2 more for a footlong at subway or go to food court.Can't believe this place stayed in business.Never again."
1,"This show was amazing, visually and entertaining. First of all the seating is awesome, there is no seat that's bad here. I can't even explain how crazy the walls move and how everything switches around.  The storyline was pretty easy to follow. This isn't your ordinary trapeze artists and circus performers. This is a show that entertains your eyes, mind, and shall I say it your soul. \n\nGO WATCH THIS SHOW!"
1,"I'm tripping out on the number of stars this place has, I totally think it should be 5.  Vegas should be excited that we have a coffee Shop like this in a town where Starbucks and strip malls abound.  \n\nThis place looks amazing, the iced drinks are great, the tap water has lemons in it!!!! What else do you want?????\n\nCute date spot, great place to bring your family"
0,Worst customer service ever we got\nInto 25min argument over 3 dollars and they ended up not helping us out
1,"Chicken marinated and grilled to crispy skin perfection over an open flame. I love it. I love it so much I could marry it. Only if I did, we would never have kids since she'd be barren from all the flame grilling and marinating. \nI'm not sure that's the life I envisioned as a young man. \nI want a couple more kids, but not with a flame-broiled chicken.                                               i don't care how hot she is. \n\nThe pollo bowl is only five bucks...'bout a half of a breast, rice and beans in a six inch bowl. Quite a lot actually. \nEIther get here at 11:30 or wait until after 1:30, when after the lunch crowd subsides.\n\nBe prepared for panhandlers standing just outside the door asking for loose change.\nSuch a great hood. \nEnjoy."
0,The guy working was very rude. They closed thirty min early and all sat outside drinking coffee. Then told us they're closed. When I said your website says your open he yelled again at me and said they're closed.
0,"Disappointed in the food. The items we ordered were flavorless. Our orders were brought out wrong. Our server was seriously super slow. On the flip side the place is rather nice with a huge outdoor patio. Unfortunately, I do not foresee myself returning here."
1,"I got the classic but upgrades to the Kobe which was so tender and off the hook juicy and amazing.  Very cool place, open and trendy.  Had a really cool feel.  I also got the banana pie which was off the hook deliciously. Definitely highly recommend this place for a gourmet burger, best in Gilbert for sure!"
0,"I wish I could rate zero star, not even 1. \nNot talking about food here.  Just salty. That's not a big deal. Service here was hooorrribbblllee!!\n\n Am from NYC and stopped by Montreal before heading out to quebec city. The restaurant is nearby airport. What can I expect about the food here?\n\nService here was the trouble itself. \nWe,7, ordered bunch of steaks and lobsters.  Food came out pretty late.  That was fine cause we were sorta big group in this neighbor. \n\nBtw how can we eat lobster without cracker? Kidding me? Waiteress brought the cracker almost when we finished. And ordered the rentil soup. Of course she forgot the soup. My dad got the soup when everyone else almost finished the soup.  How lame. \n\nBread.. How come they don't serve free bread with butter before the meal? Isnt it the best part of the dinner? Oh they did.  They served the bread for other table, not for us.  I asked gently why we didnt get the bread.  She(vic?) explained i'm supposed to ask manager to get bread.  Kidding me? I didnt even know they serve the bread before i saw the other table. How the hell i know they serve the bread? Isnt it supposed for them to ask customers whether they want bread or not?? Well, She asked me if i want bread when i'm about to ask the check. I said \""fxx you\"" in my mind. \n\nOrdered kids meal for my nephew and niece.  They were cream pasta and chicken finger.  They were obviously worst kids menu ever.  Pasta tasted like hmmm. Can't even describe it. Chicken finger was very moosh. Btw, Where was the crayon for waiting ?? \n\nshe totally ruined my trip to montreal and would never come back here."
0,"I placed an order for two, didn't receive a single napkin and also received the wrong flavor of donuts. It was your typical poor fast food experience. I'm not encouraged to return for another visit."
0,Without a doubt this is the worst and horribly managed McDonald's in the entire universe.\n\n11 minutes to get an unsweetened tea with light ice if you can't get that order right you really shouldn't be working anywhere other than the hospital that did your lobotomy. I am convinced they are only in business because they have a golden arches and people who know no better go there. \n\nI will not be making that mistake again!
1,"The Creative Quest is a terribly cute little store in old-town Glendale.  The shop sells all manner of handmade papers, rubber stamps, scrapbooking notions and book-binding supplies.\n\nI originally found this store because it's a great place to buy origami paper.  They take the paper remnants and cut them into squares to be sold in bulk, variety bags.  It's an amazing deal for a collection of fine, textured paper.\n\nCheck out their website for the workshops going on each month!"
1,"Take and Bake pizza makes sense! It tastes great, is supremely fresh and is a ton cheaper! Papa Murphy's offers custom toppings, vegetarian options and good old fashioned combinations! The staff at this location is fresh, fun & friendly. Whether you call your order in or come to order in person - the wait time is usually under 10 minutes. Ask for a punch card - after so many orders you get a free pizza. 5 stars for solid service and selection! Let Papa Murphy's do the cooking for you tonight!"
1,"Creation is one of my favorite restaurants in Charlotte. There are lots of things that are great, from the decor to the prices to the service...it's one of the places I come back to again and again, and I like to bring friends who are visiting from out of town here.\n\nMy favorite thing on the menu is the cabbage wraps with tofu. It's too much, which means I can bring some home. The half-price bottles of wine on Sundays are (obviously) an awesome asset as well. \n\nIt's a minimalist, warehouse kind of feeling inside. I love the big windows, the clean spaces, and the muted colors. The bar is nice as well, and it makes for a great escape from the Penguin's weekend frenzy if you want to be able to breathe and hear the folks you are with talking."
0,"There are two listings here on Yelp.  However, if you check Winco's website the address they show is THIS one (Power Rd), not the Hampton address.  So I'm putting my review here.\n\nThis building used to be Costco.  Costco moved about a mile down the road, and Winco moved in.  Winco reminds me of Food4Less.  Same basic layout, and I don't think Food4Less took credit cards either.  Plus you bagged yourself, just like Winco.\n\nThe prices here are mostly reasonable.  You can do better in a regular grocery if you shop the sales, however.  For everyday prices these guys are a little lower, and I think at least some of that is the 5% (approximately) that they save by not accepting credit cards (VISA and those all charge a percentage of every transaction, which stores pass on to us).  Factor that in and this place probably isn't any better than Basha's or Fry's, and not as good as Costco.\n\nDon't get me wrong, it's not a bad store.  But I wouldn't make a special trip here unless they had some great sale or coupon (which they did for their grand opening).  They are more hype than anything really special.\n\nAnd, just to emphasize, they DON'T take credit cards.  Be aware of this, because they don't have it posted anywhere except at the registers.  By then you've already finished your shopping.  If it weren't for this I'd probably have granted three stars."
1,I went here out of curiosity after stopping by PetSmart next door & I was pretty amazed to see that it had a lot of home decor & a great selection of all things dog lovers (like myself) would buy. This is definitely a store to shop for gifts & I will shop here more often now that I've discovered it.
1,"FUN FUN FUN & CHEAP CHEAP CHEAP!  Fremont St. is THE place to people watch, hear good music from cover bands and street musicians, drink on the cheap, and just explore.  The light show that happens on the hour with bands like Queen, The Doors, Don McLean (which by the way is awesome singing American Pie with thousands of strangers)!  So much is happening on this street you'll forget the time."
1,"This is a review for the hotel. I'll update the review should I ever play games here. Jean-Philippe will gets its own review when I've tried enough of their selection, but they have good seafood quiche!\n\nI've been spoiled by this hotel, for future Vegas trips I'll be expecting rooms as nice as this one. \n\nThis is one of the newer hotels in Vegas, situated near the Cosmopolitan and Mandarin Oriental hotels and Crystals shopping complex. It offers the 21st century equivalent of classy, different from the Bellagio. Check-in was hassle-free and straightforward. Upon going up to our rooms, the room was clean.\n\nStayed here twice on standard rooms. Instantly I was hooked on the touch panel on the center screen, which basically controlled everything except the bathroom (that would be kinda creepy if it did) and call room service. You could even review your bill and check out, which is one of the best perks about this place. \n\nBeds were very comfortable, with the exception of snoring I had a good two nights sleep. TV was in HD and contained most of the common channels, so I was able to catch a bit of my favorite show being aired. LOVED the overall design of the rooms, gives a new meaning to contemporary and classy, from the mirrors to the drawers. If you get a room of the view, the windows are big enough to peer down at the Strip below, especially with all the lights at night. \n\nBathrooms were just simply GORGEOUS. Toilet and shower/bath had its own compartments. Glass is opaque on both doors.\n\nService is pretty good. We had a wonderful housekeeper who brought us plenty of shampoo and shower gel, and still kept an upbeat attitude when we forgot to ask for towels initially and asked him again."
0,"This location for some reason has a high volume of customers for some reason. They are undermanned and don't have enough people working to move the lines. The last time I was here, a lot of screaming and angry customers going on. I kinda was saying to my self that the dude needed to take a chill pill but in the end, if that was me, I wouldn't be happy that they can't find my package and have no answers. So there is some pain I feel for the dude. Other than that, the service is good. Just will have to be willing to wait for a..........while."
0,"I've never written a review so damn fast...first off the post office is the post office...it's going to suck a whole lot of the time...I get it. Aside from this place from having that old beat up interior decor...here's what happens just now:\n\nHusband and I went in to send a return package to Cox. The box was ready to go with the exception of tape. Idk who this \""customer service attendant\"" is that runs the floor while you're waiting in that long \n@$$ line but she approached us and lectured us on the collapsible box package...she said with a snicker, \""You can't send it like that you have to tape.\"" The first time my husband said, \""oh ok, it's ok I'll get the tape.\""  BUT forcefully repeated it 6 times! As if she was pissed off and lecturing her 9 year old kid! WTF?!? I interjected before my husband blew his top and said, \""OK that's fine lady we'll know next time. I want to leave NOW! I'm not going to be disrespected for no damn reason.  She is fu\u20acking ridiculous rude. \"" \n\nSo ummm maybe regulations have changed and you have to wrap your packages before you approach the counter.  Lady...whoever you are....learn the CORRECT way to approach someone! you're better off saying, \""Oh, you just need to wrap it with tape before we send it off.\"" And left it at that!....My husband and I are grown @$$ people. We will buy some fu\u20acking tape here and wrap that bit\u20ach up no fu\u20acking problem!!!...I don't need anyone lecturing me on how to package. \n\nApparently you all DO NOT inspect your packages like you USED TO (at least they do in San Diego)...so USPS security must be $hit since all those budget cuts. Hmm...Beware consumers!...USPS apparently hire people who lack common sense and social interpersonal skills...idgaf if I'm sending one single chicklet...I'd rather deal with UPS."
1,"The Fremont Street Experience is a blast.

0,"I came here recently on my lunch break. The place is cute but tiny. Totally packed. Waited about 45 mins for my to go order, as I was leaving I noticed they left out 1/3 of my order! I had to go back and wait another 10 mins for the missing piece. That leaves 5 mins to eat and get back to work lol. I got a healthy Cobb salad that wasn't too tasty... But I did enjoy the mini cranturkey burger.  I wasn't the only one who had a bad experience this day... Lots of ppl waiting and very unorganized for call ahead orders.\n\nMaybe this was just a bad day... I will call ahead next time and give them another chance."
1,"This place is not going to win any Michelin stars or James Beard awards, however if you're looking for fast, cheap, and good sized portions Mi Patio hit's the spot. The service is always excellent too.\n\nI like the free chips and the salsa is always fresh and excellent.\n\nShredded beef tacos are HUGE and tasty.\n\nDuring the day every beer is $3 but they ALWAYS have $3 Tecate beers 24/7 and they always give you a free shot of some tequila concoction. \n\nBOTTOM LINE: I'm a regular but don't tell anyone ;)"
1,Always wonderful.  Great food and good service.  It's a shame that the patio is in a parking lot but that is my only compliant.
0,"A visit this particular store (#1108) was an ordeal, exemplified by two staffers:\n\n1) The moody 'customer service' rep who doubled as the cashier.  On a strict academic, anthropological level one had to admire her economy of words.  Indeed, she seemed to have distilled spoken English, which linguists often categorize as a notoriously complex tongue, to a series of monosyllabic grunts that no doubt allowed her to conserve energy and finish her shift as fresh as when she clocked in.  'Yeh...No...ID?...Bag?'  Minimalism isn't just for modern art anymore - it now applies to communication!\n\nIn keeping with some bizarre trend in 'service' (sorry but the quotes are still necessary to convey irony), this cashier eschewed eye contact and instead stared into the far corners of the store.  What could she be watching, one wondered?  The movements of her colleagues?  Her favorite show (possibly a cartoon) visible on a distant flat-panel screen?  In any case, the girl with the faraway eyes managed to complete a transaction without once looking at her point of sale display or the customer standing directly opposite.  Quite an achievement in its own odd way.\n\nAh, but the final touch was the completion of the sale.  Most consumers long ago abandoned any expectation of a simple, courteous 'Thank You' for making a purchase ($200 in this case) and doing their part to pay salaries and keep the doors open.  Somehow, a vague suggestion among retail and foodservice staffers to 'Have a good one/day/night' has supplanted any expression of gratitude.  But our girl wasn't having any of that chat and, after the exertion of placing a single item in a single bag, left the bag to languish on the counter top.  None of this pick it up and offer it to the customer!  Who does that customer think he is, anyway?  He can damn well lean over to the far side to reach the bag handles and haul it off his grand self!\n\n2) The DIRECTV Vampire.  No, it isn't a limited-run gothic drama offered by a particular satellite provider.  The vampire is the guy/girl in the navy polo watching for fresh blood to enter the store.  The customer walks down an aisle, stops to examine a product, and the vampire approaches stealthily from behind.  'Finding everything OK?  Say, who's your TV/cable provider?'  Cue the sales pitch.  An optimist might inform the vampire that he already is a subscriber of DIRECTV (really!) but the vampire is undeterred.  Come to Best Buy and renew!  You get access to a supersecret customer service phone line!  The customer wonders why he isn't getting top-tier customer service already, based on the exorbitant amount he spends on DIRECTV every month but why prolong the conversation?  \n\nFor many, the prospect of dealing with a new or used car huckster and the hard sell keeps them coaxing every last mile out of their older-model vehicle.  Now the full car dealer log-rolling experience is available to the poor sap who just wants to grab a Bluetooth earpiece or a phone case and get on with life.\n\nThe vampires may be 'independent contractors' but obviously they wouldn't be stalking any and all without approval from and coordination with Best Buy.\n\nIronically, the vampire is the only one who approaches the customer to offer assistance, ulterior motives notwithstanding.  Thank heaven for small favors!\n\n\nAnd so, the full flower of making a simple purchase at Best Buy:  the loyalty program....the warranty pitch with its melodramatic (if unconvincing) Fear Uncertainty & Doubt (FUD) routine...DIRECTV 'partnering'...the upsell.  At corporate HQ they are looking for any ray of light, any means of grabbing the customer by his figurative ankles and shaking him like a piggy bank, waiting for that last dime to fall out.  But the slick training videos, hyperbolic rah-rah slogans, white-board targets etc. lose something (badly) in transit to front-line operations.\n\nAnd so, the customer gathers his own bag in silence, exits past a glowering Loss Prevention type, and berates himself for weakening and shopping retail just one more time.  He is now fully resolved to save himself a trip and several headaches by shopping online where no web server has ever given him attitude, attempted to interrupt his browsing with irrelevancies, and where at least the e-mails say thank you, however automated they may be.\n\nFinding everything OK?  Why yes - on the internet!"
1,"I really love their shrimp tacos. A bit pricey that can go up to $10 for 3 pieces but put some lime on it and green salsa, OMG that's heaven in your mouth."
1,"I found the prices here cheaper than Walmart and this store is allot cleaner. The floors are waxed  and employees friendly . I but the orange blossom honey and all kinds of groceries here. Milk ,potatoes , lemons  and the basics are inexpensive . A good place to go during these tough times."
1,"Maybe its because I can't handle the sheer mass amount of food given at other buffets, but the serving sizes and taste of each item is FANTASTIC! Starting from every single breakfast entry to heavy ribs to delicate yet perfect deserts the suave looking buffet at the sex themed cosmopolitan is perfect for me.\n\nAdd in the unlimited drinks and its great. The food isn't the greatest you've ever had, but the fact that each dish is well crafted makes a lot of difference. Another big thing, that seems to be common with all things at the cosmopolitan, is that its management runs the place seamlessly. Regardless of how long the line was, everything goes smoothly to make your breakfast wait that much shorter!\n\nOne thing I loved about this place....DESSERTS! How could you go wrong with so many great desserts, from delicate little creams to vast fields of chocolate covered strawberries...mmmm!\n\nBesides the Bellagio buffet, this is definitely one of the best!"
0,"From the crummy, dated, damaged rooms, to the crummy food, to the overpriced EVERYTHING, this place is a 100% PASS."
1,"I see a lot of negative reviews here on this business but I've had good experiences with them, sort of.\nI went in to ask about getting the carbs on my bike rebuilt. The cost was prohibitive for me but some guy, my apologies for not knowing his name , asked me what year my bike was. I told him and he said they won't even work on my bike because it was too old. Huh? He explained to me about how with bikes than ten years tend to have things break quite easily and end up costing them more to fix than they make. Ok, I can understand that.\nHe then tells me that when I bike has been sitting for a long while and the gas goes bad that the thing to do is run some SeaFoam through it and that will probably bring the bike back to it's original performance. Cool. \nSo he says they won't work on my bile but tells me the easy way to fix it myself. That rates pretty high in my book.\n\nThe second incident was when I went in for a clamp that I lost. He, same guy, asked me what it went to and I told him the air cleaner. He tells me that they don't have a clamp like that but I can use a zip tie to re-attach that hose to the air cleaner. I think that's some stand up advice. He could have easily told \""Sorry, ain't got one\""  and let me walk away bummed but he helped me out with some mechanic advice.\n\nIn summary, I've never had my bike worked on by them so I can't comment on that kind of experience but have been given good advice from them."
1,The view from the top is breath-taking. We parked at the top (1220 Grandivew) and took the ride to the bottom anyway. I don't think it was necessarily worth the trip but we were tourists and did it anyway. Go for the view.
1,"We were married here on 7/31/10...we were perfectly happy with nearly all aspects of our experience, most of all with our Wedding Coordinator, Danielle.  The chapel was very nice, the lighting and music were lovely, the flowers were gorgeous and the feel was very intimate and not at all \""quickie, cheesy Vegas wedding\"".  The only thing we felt could be improved upon was the photography. You are obligated to use Cashman in the chapel (you can hire anyone else for the rest of your day, and we did) and their photography was not very professional and the posed shots were in front of a background that looked a bit like your local JC Penney photo center.  Aside from that, the experience was wonderful. Danielle made our day a dream come true for us. OH, and the limo ride to get our license was really fun, that's part of the package."
1,Probably the best taco place in Vegas. My favourite is the Al pastor but j recommend you try something different every time you visit. Thats what i do and i usually like what I get.
0,"This is a rundown on the hotel as I did not play in the casino or bars.  I stayed in a \""Hollywood Hip\"" room.  \nAbsolutely nothing special about this hotel - run of the mill.  You will get nothing more than the room for your money.\n$14 for internet connection in room\n$25 to use the fitness room?  That is only a $10 discount for hotel guests.\nShower in adjacent room made so much pipe noise there was no sleeping past 6:00 am.\nLighting in rooms is dingy.  Not even a makeup mirror.\nCould not get a late check out even on a Tuesday morning with no big events going on.\nWhen are they going to make in-room safes big enough to fit a 15 inch laptop?\n\nMall adjacent has lots of stores but not as nice and not as simple to navigate as Caesar's Mall.  The best thing was the fella that stored my luggage.  He looked me in the eye and assured me my luggage would be kept safe.  I'm one for two - lost sleep but no lost luggage.."
0,"Friends wanted Dim Sum in Vegas, and Orchids was shown as the one spot on yelp that we should go to. The restaurant is large, and they have plenty of parking. Our party was seated really quick and there were a bunch of people eating here. It is a traditional Dim Sum style restaurant where you get the cart ladies strolling by promoting their food. While the quality is definitely not on par with the 626 in California, it was decent and the service was quick. Not sure if speaking Canto helped, but god damn they came by immediately and if one of the ladies didn't have what we wanted, the manager or hostess near by would place that order on the quickness.\n\nWe orders all the usual items, like shu mai, and hai gow, which like i stated above, was decent, i've had way better back home at many other places. So overall, super great service, but mediocre dim sum"
1,Mmmm I love Johnny rockets.  $22 gets you 2 orders of burgers fries and a soda. Groupon had a discount so check it out.  I hate pickeles but it was just so.good in my burger.  Sometimes it can get very greasy but they made it just right this time around.
0,"For $43 I got a basic manicure, a lip wax & my underarms waxed. I got slightly rude stuck up service & the place looked like crap. My nails weren't even dry before I got shuffled into literally a closet to get waxed. People kept coming in to get things while I have my shirt up showing everyone my bra. I don't ever plan on coming back here again."
1,"I am so happy to have hired Green Orchid Events to help me plan our wedding! Angelica is amazing! She seriously is wedding Wonder Woman. Very organized, responsive, detail oriented, and such a sweet heart. The last few weeks of planning got my stress levels a bit elevated... My nerves and worries were just getting the best of me, but Angelica was always so positive and reassuring. She listens to what you want, what your visions are, gives you options, choices... Planning was so fun with Angelica on board. She even went above and beyond by making my escort cards and table numbers for me as I'm not much of a DIY person AT All! Our wedding day at Westin Lake Las Vegas was perfect! Everything ran smoothly, and it really was the best day of our lives. Thank you so much to Angelica and team at Green Orchid Events for helping us make such wonderful and priceless memories. They are worth every penny! We love you guys!\n\nCandice and Aries"
0,"I went there for lunch with my boyfriend. We are both cajun food fans. We ordered the spinach artichoke dip with crab. I ordered jambalaya, and he ordered the combination plate. They were all edible but not very pleasing to the palate. The  staff was nice, but the main entries took almost an hour to come out. It was pretty disappointing. I don't think I would come back."
1,This is a review of the Lounge area only* \n\nWe came in last night and pulled up four chairs in a corner spot the cocktail waitress started off slow but she was very nice and by the end was great!! We had just come from dinner so no food only alcohol!! But they had a drink special that was Grey Goose with Chambord and fresh Lemonade.....Really Really Good they were garnished with fresh Melon. \n\nThey had live music and the crowd was large. We had a great time and picked on some bar snacks that they brought over. The bill came and as we had expected it wasn't cheap in fact it was just as much as the dinner we just had!! Oh well they were good and it was a nice time!
1,"This is the largest Express I have been to.  Great deals and great selections.  The staff members were very helpful and very nice.  I ended up buying a jacket I've been eyeing for for awhile now but didn't want to spend $159.00 for it.  I came to this express and it was on sale for $40.00 and they had many sizes when all the other stored sold out of it.  The men's section also had a large selection and stocked with sale items.\n\nEnded up purchasing over $400.00 dollars worth of clothing for only $92.00.  Well stocked, many selections, great deals, and friendly staff, short lines... That deserves 5 stars in my book."
0,"My husband and I saved Craftsteak for our last night in Vegas and I wish we had skipped it altogether. If there is one word to describe the meal it would be BLAND BLAND BLAND. I don't know if the chef was out of town because it was Labor Day week-end or what, but everything was barely warm, and tasteless. We went with the Waygu tasting menu when I asked about a wine pairing they said to pick any \""flight\"" of wine that was offered because they would all go with the meal. Having had many tasting and degustation menus at many other restaurants I was very surprised by this, there was always a certain wine for each course not a \""one size fits all\"" mindset. We decided to opt out of the wine flights and stick with mixed drinks.  Our first course was Lobster Bisque which was thin and barely room temperture and as we started to eat that, out came the salads, Caesar, Heirloom Tomatoe, and Buffalo Mozzarella again all I can say is BLAND BLAND BLAND no taste or seasoning what-so-ever. Now I was begining to get really worried about our main course and I was right to worry. The steaks, while cooked fine were as tasteless as everything else, and keep in mind that all of this was served to us with-in 30 minutes of seating down. When you go out for a meal like this is \""supposed\"" to be, I don't expect to be rushed in and out the door. There were plenty of empty tables so it's not like they were busy. Anyway, I was so dissapointed in everything that after one bite of the steak my husband and I both decided to send it back. To the restaurants credit they did take it back and offer to make us something else but we just asked for our check and left. They did not charge us for the meal, just the drinks we had. Next time we are in Vegas we will avoid this place at all cost. After reading the reviews for Picasso at the Bellagio I think we'll try there. They seem to know what a degustation menu, wine pairings, and a leisurely dinner pace should be."
0,"Went in to get dinner for the family service was great at first, Tyler help us immediately with taking our order. Then there was the usual kitchen banter while they were getting orders ready. \n\nThe manager came out and asked for grilled chicken. Ok fine you need food the nice kid Tyler that help us out turned into a punk and said out loud (for me and 2 other customers in the resturant to hear him) I've got it in you stupid b*tch. Then proceeded to repeat him self 2 more times. \n\nI promptly asked for my money back and I got an attitude from him and he stormed off to get the manager. When the manager came out I was in absolute shock that this little punk was cussing at his older female manager. I absolutley refuse to return to this location until the staff is changed."
0,I cannot believe this is related to the same claim Jumper in Summerlin.   This is a nice-looking restaurant and the food is horrible.   I had chicken fingers and could barely tell the chicken fingers from the french fries for the price it was ridiculous. I tried the rotisserie chicken it was dry and flavorless I will never go back to this place again.
0,"On the plus side: the coffee was very good and they tried to seat us away from air conditioning vents. The place was freezing. \n\nEverything else: not so much.  One order of biscuits and gravy. Gravy was not  hot and had nothing in it but way way too much salt. \""Biscuits\"" were more like dumplings in that they were not cooked thru so that they were doughy.\n\nI ordered the fall special: pumpkin pancakes. They came with a huge dollop of whipped cream and something yellowish that was way too sweet. Glad I only ate one. Within the hour, I was rushing for the \""facilities\"".  Hmmm. Guess we won't be going back."
1,We've eaten here many times and the food is always good. It's always busy which shows me the food is good. Spaghetti and meatballs is a favorite along with their pizzas. They have a great Happy Hour menu so check it out!!
1,"This restaurant is in a bit of a transition. Downstairs is a cafeteria style experience that has been the standard for the restaurant. Recently the restaurant received a liquor license and started full service upstairs. Our server was very friendly and described all of the proposed changes including closing up the upstairs, but making the roofing retractable so that it could be opened on nice days. \n\nThe views from upstairs were great - despite not much in the surrounding area to look at other than ran down buildings. At least the mountains provided a good view. The linens on the table and full service made it a wonderful experience. The food was good too - we started with the freshly made guacamole. It was just as good as Cafe Laredo, but half the price. I went with a margarita for $8, which really I could skip. I ordered frozen, but didn't get it and in general it was just kind of average. The chips were very good and the salsa very good. I ordered the beef taco with carne asada - which was surprisingly really spicy. I finished with dessert - the churros and the newly introduced sundae - neither were really impressive. \n\nWhile the service was friendly and knowledgeable, the server was a bit slow. I am sure that will improve as they get more experience with the full service. The entree and the app was exceptional - skip the drink and dessert and it would be perfect. Overall it was just over $50, but subtract the $8 drink, the price for the churro and sundae and it would be a good meal at a good price. \n\nWhile the bar isn't very high, this is definitely my new favorite Mexican restaurant in Queen Creek. I will be back frequently."
1,helpful funny and nice staff. always try to get your the best deal weather it's a coupon from the paper or your insurance they want to get your the glasses you want for a good price. doctors are informative during procedure and always keep appointments.
0,"Worst experience I have ever had in vegas by far. Got to our room and it is not what i had reserved. Instead they gave us two small beds when i reserved a king. Went down to ask for the king bed like i reserved but was not taken serious and told there was nothing they could do. Asked to talk to a manager and there was no one there til the next day. Receptionist was rude and rolled her eyes when we asked to talk to someone. They called a pit boss to help but all he gave was a phone number to a manager. I called, left messages, but no one would even listen to me. Awful customer service and i had to squeeze into that uncomfortable small bed for the night."
1,"I went here for the first time with my wife yesterday having expectations that this was going to be similar to a Black Angus or Outback. We got there at about 7:30PM, which seemed like the tail end of their dinner rush. I could see several open tables, but was told that it was going to be a 25 minute wait. Normally I would have walked away then but my wife really wanted a steak and options in Surprise are limited.\n\nDespite the open tables we waited about 20 minutes to be seated. After sitting down, we waited around for another 15 minutes to get our drink orders in and another 10 minutes after that to actually get our drinks and bread. Service was very slow.\n\nOur server was friendly and helpful, but it was obvious that she was overwhelmed with the number of tables assigned to her, which is probably a management issue.\n\nWhile waiting for our food I checked the restaurant out and it was very clean (I would hope that it would be because the building is less than a year old). The only place that seemed to need some attention was the restroom. It looked like it had been hit by a dinner rush crowd and was is need of a cleaning.\n\nWhen our food arrived it looked very appetizing. My wife order the filet mignon and I had the parmesan crusted chicken breast. We both ordered the baked potato as a side with a side salad to start. I thought that all the food was great and worth the wait.\n\nThe filet mignon was very tender and prepared perfectly. The chicken was good but I wish I had ordered the steak after tasting my wife's. The salad was fresh and the baked potato was good. In all the food was very good.\n\nThis places food is great, but the service isn't. If I'm going to shell out $90 for two dinners, one appetizer, and four adult beverages I would hope for much better service.\n\nThis could be a five star spot if not for the service."
1,"The Scotch Whisky Experience lies in the center of some Venn diagram of things that are embarrassingly touristy, goofily hokey, and actually pretty cool.\n\nThe Experience (which seems to also be referred to as the Scotch Whiskey Heritage Center) consists of a few different elements: \n\na. A tour you can take that teaches you about whisky.\nb. A bar/tasting room you go to at the end of the tour.\nc. A gift shop where you can buy bottles of whisky and various souvenirs. \nd. A restaurant (which I did not go to). \n\nThe tour itself is a combination of interesting and cheesy. It starts off with an \""educational\"" amusement park-style ride that you might find in Epcot Center. You sit in a barrel-shaped cart that goes down a track while a hologram explains the process of making whiskey to you in the language of your choice. No, I'm not making this up.\n\nFollowing that you go into a room where an actual non-holographic human being gives you scratch-and-sniff cards and teaches you about the four regions of whisky-making in Scotland. I am not making this up either. \n\nYou then get to choose which region you want to sample whiskey from (hint: if you've never had whiskey before go with Speyside or Highlands malts. They tend to be the sweetest and smoothest. Islays are the harsh peaty whiskeys) and your host pours you a small tasting glass. \n\nThe next step of the tour is the largest collection of whiskey in the world. It's an impressive collection and very well presented. I believe you can pay more to take the last tour of the day which allows you to spend more time in the collection room. I found it interesting, but didn't feel like I was missing out on anything by mainly looking at the collection as a whole, and not examining each individual bottle. \n\nFinally, the tour exits into the tasting room. If you paid for the \""silver tour\"" you are now done. If you bought the \""gold tour\"" you get a flight of whiskey from the tasting room. This flight is chosen by the museum and will generally consist of a lower-end whiskey from each of the four regions. Please do not ask the host to give you top-shelf 30 year malts instead. \n\nYou can also purchase glasses of whisky in the tasting room. I found if you sit at the bar and wait until the wave of people from the latest tour group have trickled out, the host will have time to talk to you and make some good recommendations based on what you've tried that you like. \n\nThe hosts were all very friendly and very knowledgeable.\n\nWhen you decide you're done there, you can go to the gift shop and buy whisky to take with you or any number of little tchochkes.\n\nI wouldn't say I learned a ton at the Scotch Whisky Experience, but I found the tour design to be fascinating (you can tell some serious money and thought went into it - even if it is hokey), the large whisky collection to be impressive and getting recommendations from the hosts to be worthwhile. All in all an enjoyable way to spend part of an afternoon if you like whisky."
1,"Oh I love this place. When a generic Harkins theater closed on Mill, the space could have been converted into more chain restaurants and/or overpriced urbany lofts. Instead we got an independent multi-plex! Not one that shows new indy movies, but one that hosts weekly or monthly screenings of audience participation classics like Rocky Horror, The Room, and Carrie! Plus they have special events with some of the stars - I met Mink Stole and the stars of \""The Room\"" within a single eight-week period.\n\nThis place makes me happy. :)"
1,Probably the best Mexican food on the strip! Fresh food great choices and everything tasted amazing. Be sure to flash your players card for 15% off. The wine selections are quite enticing and not super over priced. It's affordable food on the strip still with great flair.
1,"Very nice place to stay. Buffet line was very long, about 30 min wait in the VIP line and was just OK. The rooms are large. very nice decor. The people were very nice. The kids loved the pool with the sandy beach walk-in. my only neg was that the sink had a huge crack in it and the drain was very slow. Oh and I was a little sticker shocked by the $7, 12 oz. lemonade at the pool. No wonder there are no prices on the drink menu."
1,"In a city full of great coffee places and pastries, Caf\u00e9 St. Henri is quite deserving of another rave review.  Despite our group overwhelming the small staff, everything was A-okay.  All our coffee drinks came with a palate cleansing shot of sparkling water (nifty idea). My very pretty latte was one of the best tasting I've ever had....and I've had many.  And the berry muffins were amazing, fluffy and chock full of actual fruit.  Can you ship some to me please?!"
1,"We take our Boy Scout troop here for special functions - and everyone always has a great time. The games are fun, it's not overly noisy and ridiculous like some other places, and the pizza is actually really good. The staff is great. We love coming here."
1,"Wonderful staff. \nOutstanding location. Big rooms very comfortable beds. If you are going to PNC park, stay at the Hyatt. \nSecured parking area that is fenced in. \nGreat computer area and excellent WiFi."
0,"So I really like cheba hut and they are usually able to get my order right, but this time was a complete joke.  Me and my boyfriend told them the order 5 times to 3 different people and they couldn't grasp that I only wanted 3 things on my sandwich. We ended up leaving and hopefully they know how to refund my money."
1,Seem like a great place to hang out and talk with a group of friend.\nI'm a tea lover and they have a great variety of tea available. Wish I can try them all. \nI usually order the green apple tea.
1,"I had an amazing time here! I didn't have any services done, just paid $45 for the day pass. I sat in the different pools, enjoyed some tea, and just had a very relaxing hour. They provide you with everything you need - flip flops, hair cap, curling iron, hair gel, deodorant, toothpaste, etc. They were lacking the snacks department, only pretzels, bananas, apples and oranges. All the women were wearing swimsuits. I loved the multiple shower heads in the shower."
0,"Never again! I was returning packages with prepaid UPS shipping labels. The labels didn't come out on 2 of the packages so I requested she use my hard drive to print 2 new labels. She informed me it would be $5.00 first to use the computer, then pay for the printing, then pay for the handling as the labels were already paid for. Now understand I did expect to pay something, just not all this! FYI, the lady was not very friendly at all!!!\nWent right down the street on Windmill's UPS store next to Vons and wow! WHAT A DIFFERENCE!! The employee took my hard drive and printed the labels and gladly took care of everything and at no charge. I have just found a new UPS store to use!"
1,"We go to Arties all the time and have never had any issues and love it more now that they have a post office in the back, so we don't have to drive to the post office. It is a little cramped, but the staff has always been great in helping me find things. I also love the fact that I can take my dog. She loves to go in there but I won't take her during very busy times."
0,"I was so hungover our first morning at the MGM, I couldn't even leave the hotel even though I should have. \n\nManfriend and I decided to grab a bite at Studio Cafe after checking out the menu.\n\nThe only star goes to our waiter, Jose who was very polite and attentive.\n\nThe food is a different story. Tell me why weren't both of our  hashbrowns, which I was looking forward to the most, even lukewarm? It was COLD and tasted like cardboard. The breakfast burrito was disgusting. Took one bite and felt like throwing up. Babe's steak and eggs didn't look too appealing either. He liked the steak but everything else was a culinary disaster. From the lingerging old lady perfumes, the food and my hangover, I couldn't stand to sit there one more minute. Asked man if he didn't mind eating in the room because I was about to hurl right then and there. Grabbed Jose as quickly as we could, paid $60.00 for the worst food I've eaten in a long time. \n\nShould have Yelped it before hand but nonetheless, NEVER AGAIN."
0,"It's very pitiful that I have to give a 1 star to any restaurant or business. But this place deserves it.\n\nBurger King hasn't really been good for anything, really. The fries stink and are usually cold, and the burgers have spots with color. I really have no idea what it is.\n\nThe few times that I've been to this location, we've only gone through drive-thru. The dining room always looks closed. There was one instance when I pulled up to the speaker, and no one answered for about 2 minutes. I drove around to the window, and the lady didn't really apologize and just took my order. \n\nI really didn't know what I was supposed to expect. The food always sucks, and so does the customer service. I won't be going back."
0,Worst service ever by Rob and the manager. \nJust asked for no chili mayo and I get a give minute speech about I better not have allergies or they can't serve me. The manager needed me to confirm I can eat everything in the burger and then substituted the fry dip even though my friend could eat it.
1,Fresh ingredients as far as produce is a must (I don't eat beef or pork) so this joint nailed it for quality greens and spices. Wines were a tad pricy but quality nonetheless.
1,depending on who is cooking that day you can order the same thing and it will be cooked differently.  that is my only complaint.  other than that the food is above average .  best bacon cheese burger in the area for the money .  try the deep fried zucchini but make sure they cook it thoroughly. it can be amazing.  breakfast is slow but cheep and good.
1,"The Paseo Verde Trail may not be the Grand Canyon. It is a star short of as good as it gets.\n\n  Paseo Verde Trail is laid out in the heart of Henderson's Green Valley Ranch community. It travels along the south border of Paseo Verde Parkway from St. Rose Parkway at the west to Valle Verde Parkway at the east.\n\n  Going back to 2007, long before Yelping, I have been hiking on the Paseo Verde Trail. My favorite Paseo VerdeTrail hike has been between Green Valley Ranch and the Paseo Verde at Valle Verde Starbuck's. Talk about two awesome trailheads. Fill up at a buffet, loose calories walking, relax with a Frapucino, and loose additional calories.\n\n   Hiking on the Paseo Verde Trail leaves me spiritually uplifted and physically improved. It is urban planning as good as it gets. Paseo Verde Parkway, the companion asphalt resembles a windy park drive more than an arterial in the shadow of Interstate 215. A major segment of the trail features two dual right-of-ways that separate bike and pedestrian travel. Lush landscaping is in abundance. This attracts birds and butterflies. Graffiti (kudos to Green Valley Ranch) is nonexistent. This attracts people of all ages to the trail. Throughout the trail there are decorative shade stations. These are enjoyable places to relax on a bench in the shade. A cool feature are their water fountains, regardless that they never work.\n\n   Paseo Verde Trail also functions as a linear park that connects the neighborhood parks throughout Green Valley Ranch. It touches the northern boundaries of Discovery and Paseo Verde Parks. In a sense Paseo Verde Trail is a linear extension of these community parks.\n\n   Paseo Verde Trail is just one star short of being as good as it gets. It is still Awesome. Paseo Verde Park will certainly join the other awesome parks on my \""Vegas Is Sun City\"" list. With the work that the City is doing on expanding the network of trails in Henderson, Paseo Verde Trail could become as good as it gets.  When the expansion is complete Paseo Verde Trail will be contiguous to an expanded Armogasa Trail near the Paseo Verde Library, and it will merge into the St. Rose Parkway Trail at the westernmost point."
0,"We purchased a pool fence from this company 3.5 years ago. Up until this month, the fence looked great. My kids are finally old enough to start enjoying the pool, so I figured I'd invest some time cleaning the yard and planting some flower pots. When I swept the cool deck, the broom brushed against the fence and a large chunk of the light colored paint fell right off. Prior to this, there was no visible evidence of rust along the actual fence. The only area where I've seen rust was on a separate gate, and it was only barely visible around a welded joint. \nJust a year ago, I called our salesperson to come back to give us a quote on possibly reconfiguring the fence....and he certainly made no mention of seeing any rust as walked the fence and discussed our options. \n\nWhen I called to ask what they could do, a very nice and friendly woman informed me that we only had a 3 yr warranty, and since we were at 3.5 yrs, we would need to repair ourselves. She recommended sanding and repainting the rust area.\n\nThis sounded easy enough, but when my husband started to sand the area, the paint literally started to lift off the metal due to rust underneath, and we decided we needed to have it professionally done. \n\nI called back and spoke with a gentleman first who was respectful and took some notes and then patched me through to another man who also worked in his dept. The man was aggressive from the start, even after I explained I just wanted to come up with a plan to prevent the fence from being completely junk in the near term. \n\nI first acknowledged we were 6 months past warranty, at which point he said you can't expect us to give you a new fence for free. Um...no, that isn't what I expected at all, but it was certainly enough to put me on the defensive. As I tried to explain I just wanted to figure out how we could refinish, or treat the rusty areas, he told me it was my fault for getting it wet and not maintaining it. \n\nWE HAVE A GRAVEL backyard...no grass, no sprinklers and the drip system doesn't even run near the area where the rust is evident. He said there must be some environmental changes then. Well, we still have a gravel yard, and aside from planting some flowers recently...I can't imagine what would have happened to cause rust. We don't have a bug problem, and haven't sprayed in at least 10 years, and I don't use any harmful chemicals (aside from acid in the pool) in general because I have two toddlers. \n\nI totally understand rust is caused by water, but the only water our fence is exposed to comes naturally from the ground under our gravel. I'm not sure how wet the ground is in Phoenix, but I'm sure the fence was installed properly to take that into account, right? Besides that, it rains in our yard - which isn't something I feel negligent for allowing to happen. \n\nAs much as I tried to explain the myself and diffuse the situation by pointing out that the man was being completely argumentative, he kept pushing it. What's strange is that I was honestly just calling to see what we could do...more than willing to spend $ for refinishing or whatever was needed. Yet, all he wanted to do was place blame as to why the fence was rusting. He said he's been in the business 30 yrs, and he knows all about it, and he has people all the time who try to blame the company for rust, but it's always their fault. OK...if that's not the definition of bad customer service, not sure what is. \n\nI finally said I'm not interested in placing blame, but really just want to get the fence in the condition where it can last until my kids are older. Once again, he kept wanting to explain how it wasn't his fault and I should have just spent an extra 200 to 300 dollars to avoid this. \n\nI tried to explain that when we purchased the fence, we told the salesperson we only needed the fence roughly 8 to 10 years, and he said we'd be fine with the middle-grade fence. I literally wrote this in my notes from 3.5 yrs ago, which were attached to my paperwork that I just dug up). From there, the man said there is a difference between a fence \""lasting 8 to 10 years\"" and looking good. He said the salesperson must have meant that the fence will \""last\"" that long - meaning it would provide an effective barrier for our children, but he said he surely knew it wouldn't look good that long. \n\nI finally couldn't take it any longer, and after trying one last time to get him to calm down and lower his voice, he wouldn't...and I hung up. I just didn't want to get dragged down to that level of communication with this individual. \n\nI left a message with the salesperson we worked with (3.5 yrs ago & 1 yr ago), and hope to hear back from him tomorrow. I would like nothing more than to report back on Yelp that we came to some sort of resolution - be it getting the fence touched-up or refinished at a reasonable price, since the fence shouldn't be in this condition at this point.\n\nUPDATE 7/3/2012: Unfortunately, the salesperson has yet to return my call."
1,"Great experience! It's open and inviting, and the staff was very friendly. The poutin was very good and way more food than one person can eat (in my opinion). The piece if cake was AMAZING! We also got to try the malt- again really, really good. Desserts are an afterthought at some restaurants, but not here. Beer was more of a 3.5 stars, but it was satisfying. I would say only downside is no full bar and no other beers besides theirs."

1,"Very courteous staff and more health conscious options than is usual- even for California! They sat us with a smile 10 minutes before the breakfast buffet was over, and, along with the regular fare, there was soy milk, tofu scramble, tons of fresh fruit, granola, and oatmeal with all the fixins... Rennick's for the win."
0,"The first time I went they messed up my order. I couldn't eat the sandwich because it had something I really don't care for on it (even though I explicitly asked for it NOT to include that item). I took it to go and it was late in the evening so I didn't go back. Mistakes happen, I get it. The fries were really good!\n\nThe 2nd time I again took it to go. This time the sandwich was correct, but really not good. It was gristly. I took one bite and spit it out. I took another bite, same thing. YEACH. The bread was kinda tough. The fries were really good. \n\nFries alone do not make a meal. They had 2 chances. No more. I do not recommend, unless you want really good french fries."
0,"Well, what can I say,, I had a poor expereince at McCorkicks in Sacremento and thought I would given them a go again in Las Vegas, I had the stuffed shrimp which were so small you could but them in ANY supermarket for a few dollars for 12, this dish was $25 and the portion was, wait for it not even 6 BUT 5 to a portion and small at that... I was not looking for a large portion but more so quality. this was a waste of money but even greater a waste of my time,, sad"
0,"The buffet is not even worth the 8.99 price.  There were maybe 6-7 dishes total to choose from and you probably wouldn't want 3 of them.  Scarce desserts, sad, sad salad bar.  Perhaps if they had a 2 for 1 local special it may have been worth it. I felt really bad for the servers. Not sure what the Kali style ribs were, perhaps they were the ribs of a cat!!"
0,"This child friendly establishment is decent when you're taking kids for something entertaining, and where you won't get awkward stares from couples dining without kids.  Sandwiches/burgers are usually fairly consistent in quality/taste, free refills on fries is nice, and their shakes, malts, and such are quite tasty as well.\n\nMajor downfall is that frankly they're overpriced for what they sell.  Appetizer, 2 burgers, 2 shakes, and you're looking at $40-$50 plus tip.  They just don't offer the atmosphere, high quality, and presentation of food that you get at places across the street (Cheesecake Factory, for example) to justify $9 nachos, $8 onion rings, and $10 burgers.  Since when did milkshakes cost $5?\n\nNo happy hour too, even though they have a bar.  And if you're going to charge me $3 for a soda pop I'll just pay $5 for a beer.  This is crazy."
1,"The atmosphere would be considered upscale. It was a little stuffy on the inside, in my opinion, so we decided to sit on the patio. \nI ordered sushi, and it tasted very fresh and was well-prepared. \nThe service could have used some improvement though, based on our experience. Our waitress seemed like she was new, and wasn't too knowledgeable when it came to the menu. She also somehow missed getting us soy sauce when she delivered our sushi, and didn't stop in to our table frequently enough to check on us.\nI would go back, but with slightly lower expectations for the service."
1,"I went with my friends during a bachelorette night. We got there fairly early and the place was dead. But the bartender's were cute with personality and the drag queens hopped up onto platforms every so often to dance. As the night wore on, we had a really good time dancing, but my group of friends were probably the only ones on the dance floor. This place probably would get 3 stars if not for the fact that I got plenty drunk and had an excellent fun night."
0,I ordered a sandwich here and it wasn't very good. They also didn't have honey mustard which is just an outrage.
1,Great place to have a good small portioned meal with a Lady.   Its fancy but casual.  Very inviting.  :)
1,The associates at this store are very friendly and helpful. From the moment I walked in at the door to when I checked out I was greeted and it was a speedy check out.when I had questions I got an answer right away. They have great customer service. They had all the items that I needed. I will return to this location.
0,"A few years ago, I went on a Jeremy Piven-esque sushi frenzy and ate sushi so much that I actually got a little sick of it (who knows, maybe I had mercury poisoning, too?) Anyway, I rarely eat sushi these days and even though I always walk by K.O. Sushi, I never considered trying it until reading these reviews today and, as one reviewer said, had a completely uncontrollable urge to eat sushi and had to have it right then! So, to K.O. Sushi, I went. I used the convenient on-line system to place my order for the combo with 4 pieces of sushi (crab, shrimp, tuna, salmon) and a roll of my choice. I also ordered a side of seaweed salad just to see how it stacked up to other seaweed salads I have had. \n\nI chose the eel roll and it was pretty decent and probably the best part of the meal. The eel was still warm, which is good, but I didn't think the actual construction of the roll was that great. \n\nThe sushi itself was the big disappointment.  First, though, I should note that today I went against one of my cardinal sushi rules NEVER to order shrimp and (fake) crab--as that is always the bottom shelf of all sushi. This place was no exception, so, if you are even moderately serious about sushi, avoid the crabstick and shrimp sushi or nigiri pieces. As another reviewer noted, the tuna sushi was not the highest grade and the salmon was passable but not really that great either. The seaweed salad was a very large portion, but it had way too much oil on it.  All in all, while I didn't love my meal, I partially blame myself for going with the cheap combo option and its disappointing pieces, rather than ordering a la cart and getting the sushi and nigiri that I like. But my guess is that since the quality of the fish is passable, but not excellent,the mayonnaise and cream cheese rolls will be best bet here (but, naturally, far more unhealthy). \n\nOne other minor thing: if your meal is over $10, you get a free soda. That's great, but be aware that the self-serve fountain machine produces an incredible amount a foam. I realized, as I was walking back to work, that my cup was only half full of soda after the foam cleared. No biggie, but just a word of caution to be patient with your soda filling, so you can take full advantage of this deal."
1,"Wow, very glad my girl found this place. Their bagels are amazing. They cook them perfectly and have so many varieties inside, you will fine what you crave for sure. It is a very small shop but you can tell they love what they do. trust them when they make a recommendation for you."
1,"What a great place for dinner! It's nice to dine at a place that's fancy enough and welcomes children at the same time.  They were very flexible about our reservation and service was prompt, courteous, and attentive.  \n\nFor starters, my husband had oysters and I had the sardines (of course!).  Dinner for me were mussels and frites which were very addictive to eat and my husband had the mahi-mahi.  And yes...we fed our children and they had buttered orrichiette. We skipped dessert but I'm sure that would've been good too.  Does this have better food than Nostranos?  Maybe...but what this place had was a welcoming atmosphere which is more than I can say about the pretentious ambience at Nostranos!"
1,Came in for happy hour at 5 in the lounge and came back fto try dinner at thrir main dining room at 9:30. Food was amazing!Hidden local gem! Great ambiance. Happy hour from 5-8 daily and half off tapas and select cocktails. Our bartender Patrick and the bar/ lounge staff gives impeccable service! Absolutely better than our server. I'll definitely be back here!
1,"Took the family...The portions were generous & the food was great. I recommend it, if in the area."
1,"I've been here twice, great decor, cute & really friendly staff, and lots of really nice people to shoot the bull with. I've heard the food is really good too, but haven't tried much of it yet. I did try the french fry basket, it was nice and huge, and the hot wings are good, they use Franks, so if you like reg hot, get the hot. Happy hour specials are a good value too. Will return often."
0,"I know I won't get any freebies on this review but who cares. Truth is more valuable.\nI dropped in last night. It was the cheeziest get together I've ever experienced.  Filled with people who don't know how to socialize, sad faces abounded, appeared to be a park and swap gig with cheap jewelry on tables for sale.!   The way 90% of these patrons were dressed, astonished me! OMG. Cheap cheap and quack quack!  I should of known hwen I noticed the cars in the parking lot, I've not  seen  so many old cars and trucks, since  I attending the Park and Swap experience. The drinks (wine) is so bad, you can expect to spend most your time 'later; in the bathroom with diareaha, either from the cheap beverages they serve or the nasty germs they have in this place....I would rather mow my lawn than frequent this establishment again...off to Montelucia, El Choro, & Ocean Club which are much better places to spend your money and time and eyes loking at the crowds.  Look for my lates reviews every Saturday mornings!"
0,"Horrible service. They sent someone to fix our internet because it wasn't working,  and they said there was no problem and that we aren't \""technically\"" guaranteed the wifi internet speed that we pay for and that they couldn't do anything to help us. Our internet still sucks as does Comcast."
0,Went here expecting more variety! The name is sort of misleading! Very limited to Oriental food. Not that bad but too pricey.
0,I switched with them thinking I could save some money by bundling my package and get the same type of service I had before. NOT!! The internet service is a joke. Maybe its because I live in Fountain Hills. They shouldn't even offer the service here.
0,"Like many others, I go here because there are not many options on the east side, and Sam's Town ( a solid 3 star establishment) isn't always showing what you want to see. Have to hand it to them that the theater is on one end of the building, so you don't have to walk all the way through the casino to get to it. Unfortunately there isn't really a whole lot of parking convenient to the entrance (am I the only one who has noticed that the State of Nevada has issued handicapped placards to EVERYONE)? There used to be valet service at that door, but it disappeared along with the rest of their customer service long ago.\n\nSo, you have to tack an extra 15 minutes on to your trip so you don't miss the previews, which, as we all know, are the best part. \nOn the other hand, don't hurry down, as we did, to make it to a showing that starts before 5 to get the slightly more reasonable matinee prices. No matinee rates on the weekend. Seriously?\n\nIn addition, we got into the (horrifically overpriced) concession line with only one party ahead of us, but it seemed to be a complicated transaction because the other line managed to serve 4 groups before the befuddled teenager in ours finally figured it out. Don't know which of the kids was supposed to be in charge of popcorn, but they were all out and BG had to go back and pick it up (at least it was hot and fresh). \n\nThe theater was adequate if not great, but we were disturbed a couple of times by youngsters chasing each other up the aisles. Where are the Nazi-trained ushers of my youth, standing with arms crossed and jaws clenched, ready to take out the frustration of their miserable circumstances on any intrepid hooligan who dared step out of line? Better yet, where were their parents? Probably at the Galaxy, which is where I'm going next time no matter what."
0,The $22 all you can eat dinner at More Buffet was not the worth the $22. You will get better buffet at IHOP!
1,The view is beautiful and worth the trip up to the top floor of TheHotel for the view alone.   \nMy husband and I enjoyed some great food including blue fin tuna sashimi.  I was impressed with the food; I often find that restaurants with  pretentious d\u00e9cor don't pay attention to the food but Mix did not disappoint.

1,"After a good morning of dining around downtown Phoenix and a few hours of shopping for essentials, clearing out the old condo, and studying I returned to Scottsdale for part two of my food day but (as usual) my plans to check out Barratin and/or FnB were foiled by menus that simply failed to wow.  Having heard countless times that I don't know what I'm missing in passing up these places I guess I'm simply afraid that a menu without something that really catches my attention could prevent me from ever going back and as such I searched for a plan B for dinner-before-dinner and instead ended up with dessert before dinner-before-dinner at Lee's Cream Liqueur where I would not only meet Lee herself, but also have some rather excellent ice cream.\n\nApparently more of a side job/pet business than full-time gig for Lee, the \""Cream Liqueur\"" concept admittedly seemed a bit strange to me at first, but with Lee explaining her ideas and time spent formulating the recipes I decided a taste or two wouldn't hurt and with stomach capacity plus $5 to spare a few bites of Pumpkin Pie Brandy, Cinnamon Bun Brandy, and Caramel Pecan Tequila would all prove interesting enough (and the latter two quite delicious) to justify a full order - one scoop of Carrot Cake Irish Whiskey and one of Red Velvet Scotch.\n\nNow, having admitted already that I quite liked what I tasted, I will note to purists or mavens that the texture of Lee's Cream is somewhat atypical, an effect of a blending process that that allows the booze to freeze while also using mix-ins like cake and cookies, but if this doesn't bother you then the flavors are great.  Beginning first with the Red Velvet, I loved the chocolate and scotch combination while bits of frosting added needed sweetness to the mix and moving next to the carrot cake - it tasted like a great spice cake, complete with raisins and nuts, mixed with something akin to Bailey's - it was definitely the favorite of those I tried and even if not the most technically proficient ice cream, all in all a nice idea and an interesting change of pace."
0,"I did not like smashburger at all!\n\nThe people were super friendly but the food was not good at all. \n\nDeserves zero stars. The burger didn't taste like a burger at all. There was barely any lettuce or bbq sause (I got the bbq and bacon burger). It was bland and just not tasteful at all. \n\nI do not know what all the hype is about this place. I will never return here again. \n\nSave your money, go elsewhere. \n\nThe meat was nasty (tasted like chewy dense cardboard), there wasn't enough sauce on the bbq bacon burger. Just over all not good. I won't be going there again."

0,"Horrendous. First time for both my friend and I. We had high hopes, had heard good things even from my non-yelp friends. Wasn't expecting a mid west style diner, when we walked in, the first thing I noticed was a giant big screen tv hanging over the bar replaying CNN or Fox (I can't even remember what it was, as I can't stand watching either) and a couple old dudes hanging around watching it. We seat ourselves, and we are roughly \""greeted\"" by a woman and before I can finish my sentence of ordering coffee, she has already left our table. We noticed right away she was the only one serving the entire restaurant. So she comes back to finish our order, and before two words can get out of my mouth, she leaves to go answer the telephone. \n\nWe finally place our order, San Diego Omelet with a side of grits and Monte Cristo with Sweet Potato fries. They both come out, they look decent, but one bite into the Monte Cristo and I was done, it was disgusting. Inedible and I don't know how but my fries were sour. I never leave a fry untouched. Never. I couldn't eat them. The San Diego Omelet was nothing special. The only thing this place has going for them is they don't use instant grits."
1,"Isn't the thing we all hate about Yelp is that everyone is just biased? I might be, because I'm not a big fan of pizza, and this place unfortunately didn't change my mind. \n\nI paid $6 for a slice to pick up from the \""take-out\"" window but it was monstrous. Had to bring it back to the bar which may be weird & inconvenient to most, but I was in a good mood this night so no complaints. What I will give 5 stars to is Dan the Man @ the take-out bar, he was super friendly and very informative! I got vegetarian and it was pretty good... for vegetarian. And for people who like pizza. I was expecting life-changing flavor, but none of that (hence the 4 stars). Sorry, can't speak for any meat slices out there but my friend enjoyed his! \n\nWhat I also WILL give 5 STARS to is having one of my all-time favorite beers on tap: Blanche de Bruxelles. I'm pretty sure that's hard to come by in America. So KUDOS!! Also did enjoy the loud music and continuous music video play on the TV screens. Many may not, may make it hard to have a conversation."
1,"Ok i walked in to this place while i was out there for a business trip and was in need of a cut bad i'm usually really picky about who cuts my hair (because its really thick and curly and can look really bad if cut wrong) but i had a big meeting at a casino and needed to look my best. So this women named Kat came up and asked me what i needed and how i liked my hair cut i gave her a general overview of what i liked and asked her to cut it how she would like it, well needless to say when she was done it looked great. There are people who learn to cut hair and then there are people who have natural talent to cut hair and kat was born to style hair thank you, you did an amazing job. I'll be see you for another trim next time im in town."
1,"Geez - where the heck is the prior review(s) I've done on Drago ?!?!  The Yelp ghosts are messin' with my mind !\n\nI've been to Drago at least 5 times.  At one point, it was the only bakery in the area ( sugar bee, peridot and others now compete.) \n\nI've eaten a variety of cakes, cookies, cupcakes , etc.  I've even special ordered cakes twice.\n\nMy history with DG has been a roller coaster - highs and lows.  As of late, we're on a high.  I'm a big fan of the mini-pies, especially the key lime and chocolate.  My last visit, I wanted to try the pumpkin pie but they sold out - had to go with the tried/true key lime along with a turtle brownie which I also enjoyed but would really enjoy if it had fewer walnuts on top and more caramel ( pic attached )\n\nDG is my \""go-to\"" in the southwest with Manon my other fav when I want the French-style goods"
0,"Feels like a high school dance sometimes. People don't seem to be having too much fun.  Kinda fun to dance on the risers, but those same predatory men (every time) are not fun at all.  The music has its high points but is usually just tolerable."
0,Food was decent ordered gollo burro.  Sat in bar as I travel often for work.  Was dark dirty and took ten minutes for someone to ask if I wanted a drink.  Will not visit this place again
1,"Consistantly great food, service is hit and miss but always friendly.  We usually get steak dishes, always prime and cooked perfectly.  Great choice for a special night out, fireplaces for cooler weather and misters on the large patio."
1,"I  can be a bit critical of bbq, and I love this place.  The meat is good enough without sauce, and that's all I need.\n\nI recommend the smoked catfish.  I haven't had any smoked fish like this; it's amazing. \n\nThe service is nice, kind waitress.  I guess they can run out of food.  That's kind of like the good bbq joints you would run across in the South.  Go early."
0,"I haven't seen a motel this scary since The Shining. Room 325 stunk, and 326 stunk worse. The beds must have been slept in by sumo wrestlers. The 2nd floor walk way  was slightly bent, and felt like it was going to collapse. The AC was noisy. I'm a little surprised  we didn't see ghost.\n\nThe bathroom looked clean, except for a mold stain behind the toilet. The staff was friendly and attentive. Perhaps not too strange, the clerk didn't ask us how are room was."

1,"The only service I have ever received at Total Bliss is nails & toes. I have been going to Pam for almost 5 years and she is awesome!!! Acrylics, gel nails, manicures, pedicures, I have had them all and am always extremely happy. They have the gel nail polish \""Shellac\"" here as well as a few other colors in a different brand. This stuff is AMAZING. Goes on like regular nail polish but is cured under the UV lamp and lasts for WEEKS with no chips whatsoever. Does no damage to your nails and keeps the same natural finish as regular nail polish. The salon is always clean and provides late appointments some days. My mom gets facials there ( I can't remember the girl's name :/ ) and loves them as well. Would definitely recommend booking an appointment with Pam if you are in the Gilbert area and need some nail help :)"
0,I came to Mike N Molly's to see a relative play in his band. I got there late and there was no seating. Across the street a building wall  is painted in chalkboard paint and people are allowed to draw pictures and write whatever they want. I liked that there was no cover charge.
1,"Last Call is da bomb....I luv me a discount and Last Call delivers. Unlike say TJ Maxx or The Rack, Neiman's is discounting the truly outrageous. Designers with a Capital D. You will not find Liz Claiborne or Anne Klein ala Marshall's. No.Think Chanel, think Vera Wang-Green Label, D&G, Burberry, Ralph Lauren-Purple Lable.  Also think crazy expensive, marked down. So, yes if the cashmere sweater by Chanel  was $2500, it is now $1400 - come on its a deal, albiet a deal at the Mills!  \n\nI come here for career clothes and typically I can find a good pencil skirt by Elie Tahari and a few silk shirts for under a $100.00. Granted, I'm shopping the 30% rack and only on the days that the whole store is 30% on top of it.  Everything is one of a kind - think only one size. The only eggshell blue St. John's cardigan with jewel buttons was in my size and 85% off - $30 smackers and it is exquisite. I look like a million bucks for $30.00. \n\n I drop by a few times a month to check out the deals and usually there are always a few to pick from.  My career wardrobe is growing with some beautiful pieces thanks to NM."
1,"We stopped in for a late lunch on a weekend and were very pleased with this place.  There is a fairly large outdoor seating area and the interior is nicely decorated with photographs and other art.  The servers were nice and very efficient.  I am usually not a big fan of hip-hop, but I really liked the music they were playing - the volume was just right.  The food was good to great depending on the dish.  I would have to agree with a previous reviewer that the mac and cheese is too oily and not creamy enough, although it is pretty close to southern and Caribbean style, so this might just be a matter of taste - it was pretty good though.  My wife and I both thought that the BLT was phenomenal.  It had incredibly delicious bacon, red onions, and avocado that all worked together perfectly.  I would come back just for this sandwich.  Sandwiches are inexpensive, about $7-9 and the mac and cheese was about $7."
1,"Every three weeks, I make the 2 hour drive to the Henderson Cherry Lash Lounge, so Monsey can do my Fill Plus. I am eye phobic, but Monsey makes the process easy and I have even caught a small nap in the process. \nMy lashes remain thick and full for the entire 3 weeks (I also use the Sealer, religiously).\nThis is a salon I highly recommend and an Artist to whom I have become a loyal fan."
0,"Hadn't been here in many many years. The atmosphere is wonderful and the food is plated so well. The service was okay for most of the meal, but failed between mains and dessert when the waiter just seemed to disappear. While the appetizers (a soup and a salad) were wonderful, the mains were too salty (ravioli) and well the beef tartare had so much mustard that we wondered if we should call it mustard tartare instead. We actually wondered if maybe the chef had a cold and wasn't tasting his food. Definitely not to our taste. Considering that we held this restaurant in such high esteem and how wonderfully balanced the salad was, we were shocked at how ill prepared the mains were. It's too bad, because the location is wonderful and romantic."

HEY OWNER GET SOME PEOPLE THAT TAKE PRIDE IN THE WORK THEY DO, STOP ROBBING PEOPLE.

0,"I live in the apartments across from here so I can't help but come here when I am craving wings, it's so convenient! \nBut I'm not going to sugar coat it...the service is horrible.\nOn more than one occasion I see servers standing around talking or huddling in a corner, not checking on customers, or looking like they would rather not be there (and I'm sure they don't) but that attitude reads all over your face and body language and really turns customers off...killing the entire experience. \nNow when I crave wings I just order to-go and skip the drama."
0,"When you replace the songs in your head from Katy Perry's \""Waking Up in Vegas\"" and you end up with many morbid Smith songs with lyrics like \""I was happy in the haze of a drunken hour, but heaven knows I'm miserable now\"", that's when you know you're at the Stratosphere.\n\nWhile my friends from LA stayed at higher end hotels on the more festive part of the strip, I went the cheap route with a $69 dollar rate at this hotel. Don't get me know I've had many adventures at other cheap Vegas hotels but this one takes the cake. \n\nThe best way to get by is to never turn on the lights, or be in your room in daylight. If you manage to see your room you'll be overwhelmed by the stark whiteness of it all, with no decor and a small window at the end with a window A/C unit. Basically, it looks like a room at the asylum. It also has an amazing funky smell. \n\nThe hotel is pretty far away from other attractions and the main part of the strip where all your smarter friends are. What you saved in your overnight stay you'll be making up for in taxi fees (It's about $12 one way from Treasure Island to the Stratosphere) and I wouldn't recommend walking there at night. \n\nHowever there are some pluses. First the hotel has several pools. It's one of the first few pools in Vegas that actually has clear water and look like you may not need a Hepatitis vaccine to enter. The first pool is a large pool meant for families. Basically it's like kids gone wild, and looks to be fun.  There is a smaller pool that is 21+ with a bar and dj, on a high floor so it has a great view. It also has a topless option. Please keep in mind, those who exercise the topless option are not those who should. As a women based on what you'll witness, you'll be praying to the gods of gravity, breast feeding, and plastic surgery to treat you right. The lifeguards are friendly and keep supplying you with wet towels to cool off as well as place damp towels at your feet. \n\nOne star for the lifeguard."
1,"Tl;dr-This place rocks!\nI come to this bar time and again because of the awesome atmosphere, great service, and delicious menu. \nI hear bands like The Knife & The Xx playing here often.\nThe happy hour prices are always reasonable and the drinks never disappoint. \nThere's Wednesday night Trivia! \nThe food is on par with restaurant quality & the menu exceeds \""bar food\"" expectations. The pretzel w/soft cheese is [housemade]amazingness.\nThe service is truly great, I feel as comfortable as a regular there. \nAwesome place!!"
1,"Pizza has a great flavor and the Spaghetti with Meat Sauce has Great Flavor, only too little sauce!  If you see my photos you may say it looks like a lot!  The service here is always very good!  I have to say I'm a fan because I eat here more than any Italian place!"
0,"They have children, 12 and 13 year old children running this place without adult supervision. One of the horses tried to bite my baby and I blocked my son and he bit me. There was no adult on the grounds to attend to the situation and the one adult in the office up front could really care less. He acted as if it was no big deal. Maybe it happens often. But I had to go to the hospital and take antibiotics for 10 days. I am just grateful the horse didn't bite my 1 year old. I sent a letter to the owners to inform them and they could care less as well. I will never step foot at that place again and neither should you, it's not safe!"
1,"This was totally fun! There's tons of crazy Coke memorabilia to browse. You can even get your pic taken with the Coke polar bear. And upstairs, for $7, you can sample 16 Coke products from around the world. This is the thing to come here for. Get it! James O. and I had a blast sampling all the concoctions. Ever wondered what the soda in Peru or Zimbabwe or China was like? Now you can know. And then after your around the world soda tour, you can grab a Coke float for dessert. Then you can get a giant Coke slushie to walk around the Strip with. Yeah, it's a total tourist trap and frequently overrun with families, but it's worth it."
1,"Since I moved to AZ from NY about a year ago, I have been disappointed  by  dozens of AZ restaurants that claim to be \""New York Style\"". Not just Italian restaurants. I'm just as disappointed by AZ yelpers who think they know what authentic NY style is. So it was, with trepidation, that I heeded the advice of the reviews previous to this one, and booked a table for ten for a pre theater dinner. Well, you see the five stars. How good is RigaTony ?\nLets start with service. We were pretty late for our 4:30 reservation after being stuck in traffic on the 10. They held the table, no problem, on a very busy evening. Even though we ordered our plates after 5 we got the early bird specials and the $3 glasses of wine. Again, not a problem. Our waitress was very friendly, knowledgeable about the menu and very efficient. Sodas and waters were refilled without prompting. Sorry, I didn't get her name. \nThe food. Fresh Chapati comes to the table almost immediately . There are bottles of olive oil and small dishes of freshly chopped garlic too.  Make your own concoction. The early bird pasta dishes offer a good variety of  pasta and accompaniment, are plentiful, tasty and offered in fresh semolina or whole wheat and a great value at $6.95. Three of us ordered the veal parm which we all agreed was tender, tasty, and large enough to satisfy. The sauce was thick, tangy and garlicky, much like Carmines or many of the midtown (Manhattan) Italian eateries. Also ordered at our table was lasagna and a clam and mussel dish. All were very happy with their meal. The tab for it all was very reasonable.\nThis is not a franchise restaurant. It is the real deal. RigaTony could make it in NY. The fact that it is in Tempe is, i think, fantastic."
0,"After a hockey game, we saw a sign for Fudruckers.  It advertised burgers made with ostrich, boar, elk, and american Kobe.  We thought fantastic!  Let's try this place out.  After waiting in line, we finally get to the register to order.  They don't have ostrich.  They don't have boar.  They don't have Kobe.  Really?!  We were very disappointed.  But since we were hungry, we went ahead and ordered an elk burger and a bacon cheeseburger.  When they asked how we wanted them cooked, we both said medium.  After a 15 minute wait, we received our burgers.  They were both very well done.  You get your own condiments in a salad bar style.  Kind of gross as people had their hands all over it, just grabbing things without tongs. Ew.  Beside being overcooked, the burgers were bland.  We were disappointed.  And when you factor in the price, it was definitely not worth it."
1,"AJ is awesome.  I have used window cleaners for the last 20 years and his company is by far in my top ONE!   Not only is he meticulous but he is also so professional and thorough.  I would trust him with my precious dogs that he was so gentle with.  I wish there were 10 stars cause he deserves it.  Amazing as it was, called because he was running FIVE minutes late because of an accident on the road.  That never happens."
0,"My wife and I had lunch.  we ordered the special, Philly cheesesteaks. The bread was so stale and had been left on the grill so long that the sandwiches were dry and inedible we had to request additional ranch dressing . After reminding the waiter twice we finally received our ranch dressing and some mayo.  The roast beef was so tough and stringy we finally asked for boxes and took our sandwiches home where we fed them to our dog who love them. However, the onion rings were superb."
0,"Had lunch here on a Saturday... The restaurant was completely, which might have been the first red flag. I had the chicken teriyaki bowl and my husband had the beef and broccoli bowl. Although both items came with a choice of soup or salad, the portions of the entrees themselves were on the small side. The beef and broccoli can be described as \""just okay\"" and the chicken on the chicken teriyaki was dry and didn't come with enough teriyaki sauce. We also ordered salmon nigiri which wasn't very fresh and tasted mediocre. We both left the restaurant still hungry. The only saving grace was the customer service."
1,"A ton of people told me to try this place, so I went.\n\nIt's very different than most restaurants. The place is old school, but so friendly. My pal and I had a great time! We got burgers of course. We are used to bold flavors and crazy combinations; but you will not find any of that here. They are simple burgers that have amazing taste. I repeat, do not have your hopes up for something that will dazzle you, but the quality is great. The meat was awesome, cooked to perfection. There was nothing gross about the meat, no crunchy or fatty bites. \n\nGet the home fries.... Old school Heinz bottles where you have to hit the 57. \n\nThis place is worth trying. It seemed like a type of clientele that have been going there for years. Time for the younger hipsters to revive it?\n\nTry it."
0,I asked for a call from the owner.  Never heard from them - apparently they don't care either.  I guess that's why their staff don't care either.
0,Hands down the worst restaurant experience I have ever had in Vegas. Which is really a shame because I loved staying at the palms place and the front desk service was phenomenal. When me and my group got to the restaurant the hostess sat us and it wasn't busy. After about 20 min the waiter came and got our drink order and walked off. I overheard the table behind us talking about how poor the service was and how they should leave. The waiter then goes and talks with a female co worker for ten minutes before coming back to re take out order because he didn't write it down and thought he could remember it...apparently too difficult. So we sit and wait another 15-20 and notice tables around looking irritable and one gets up and leaves. I try to wave the waiter over and he ignores it...we get up and leave and never even got our drinks in the hour we were there. Will not recommend to anyone.
1,I've been waiting 4 months to return to this bakery.  They were located on S Jones Rd in the Market 168 shopping center in Las Vegas.  They now take credit cards for purchases over $25.\n\nI chose the same 2 items I bought last time.   The hotdog wrapped in a bun was like sweet  Hawaiian bread wrapped around a hotdog.  The cream cheese bites were as good  as I remembered.  Yum!\n\nI will be back!
0,"Sadly a costly business decision cost them another customer.  Apparently overnight they raised the minimum debit/credit to $20.00 due to increasing Costs?!?!  Sadly they lost more than that with me. Mediocre sandwiches, a perpetually dirty floor and now this....Mr. Lee when will you get it?"
0,"Meh.\n\nFirst food and bar was the first place that we went after we arrived in Vegas. We had three appetizers (the egg rolls, the wings, and the goat cheese souffle), my husband had a beer, and we had a pitcher of Sangria. The bill was $100.\n\nI thought the prices were outrageous for what you get. The wings were decent. Egg rolls were mushy wrapper mostly with a little bit of filling. They were not very good. And the cheese souffle is decent-- it's like a goat cheese mix served on big pieces of lettuce. It was all just OK. The sangria was good, and the pitcher was big enough that we each had two big glasses.\n\nThe restaurant was dead. This was probably about 530 on a Friday afternoon. Our waiter was not very nice or attentive.\n\nAbsolutely skip this place. There's a reason it is empty."
0,"On all fronts.. food, atmosphere, service, drinks... SakeBombers is just okay... and that might even be stretching the truth.  \n\nThe sushi is sub-par as are the cocktails.  They do have lots of happy hour and reverse happy hour specials but they are again... mediocre.  Considering that I can walk here from my house and stumble home if need be... I still would rather go eat/drink at MANY other places instead.  \n\nThe volcano roll is not very spicy as it is claimed to be and the wings are a bit soggy.  \n\nThe atmosphere leaves much to be desired... Its like they didn't know if they were going for the asian theme or for a more swanky cool vibe... and they ended up in this bad middle ground that leaves you feeling confused."
0,The most arrogant and pretentious staff of any Home Depot I have ever encountered. It is well worth going to Route by magnitudes of infinity.
0,Had the Churro Caramel Crave and the churros were over cooked in the microwave and destroyed my desert experience. Nice kid who made it but maybe they should have fresh churros instead of microwaving frozen ones. Disappointed because I love Cold Stone but I honestly wasted my money.
0,"Think the food will be good... If it ever gets here. One waitress working a crowd of about 100 customers. I get that it must go in spurts due to flights, but this is extraordinarily bad. Don't come if you're hungry."
0,"I've been coming to this buffet before it was even called Flavors... Basically it's like an international buffet but the variety within each country is limited. The quality reminded me of hometown buffet, but it gets the job done of getting you full.\n\nCame here during breakfast not really hungry. Stuffing yourself in sin city, what they hey? seems appropriate. There was nothing that I didn't try at this place. If you dined with me before at a buffet, you'd know I eat a lot (like there's no tomorrow). They had an omelet bar which seemed like a hit due to the line, but I'm against the whole waiting in line in a buffet while food is all around you.\n\nI can point out many flaws of this place. Service sucked coming from a deaf server who worked as slow as a Windows 98 computer, prime rib was as chewy as the Trident gum I had in my pocket, scrambled eggs had a cake texture that you had to cut through, breakfast sausages had a casing stronger than my iPhone's, crab legs were puny, sushi tasted and looked like two colored lego pieces. \n\nCouple of goods were the bacon, crisp, unburnt with a great porky taste. Broccoli were steamed to the right texture. The sashimi got me going back for more. I had a good 2 or 3 platefuls of these suckers. The best thing you can creatively make at this place is tuna w/ 'broccoli rice' wrapped in bacon \""sushi\"". I also got bored with flavors from eating everything separately so I made prime rib tacos, mock sausage bacon and egg biscuits from McDonalds, vanilla tart using vanilla syrup and a heart waffle, and a sashimi sandwich with a dinner roll. \n\nFor about 25 bucks a head, you'll get full off of \""ehh\"" quality food, but it gives you a reason to be playful as well because you won't feel so bad from eating plates of bland food. \n\nP.S. - save room for dessert and don't eat here! They skimp on the sugar, oil, butter or something that has to deal with sweets' flavor. There's a Ghirardelli shop a couple steps from the buffet that'll oversatisfy your taste buds for sure."
0,"Maybe I set my expectations too high but my stay last night was a huge disappointment. The Luxor is marketed to be one of the better places to stay, but upon checking in and getting to my room at best it seemed very average. Also, room was not clean (found chewing gum stuck on wall and a used band-aid on window ledge, also lots of garbage behind nightstand). Overall the place seems rundown and old. The Casino was not lively at all, restaurant was average with bad service.... \n\nOverall a disappointing experience."
0,"If you've ever been to a zoo, it's a lot like going to an Apple store. They smell terrible.. like a zoo. Most likely it's from constantly being packed, but it always makes me think it smells sweaty from all the people touching all of the electronics. I'm not a germophobe, but if I was, this place would make me cry.\n\nIt's always too crowded in here to get service, and with Apple's super hip no counter thing, it means that while I'm standing there wanting to spend $1200, nobody is available to help me because they're showing teenagers how to use to Macs to take webcam shots. I don't even know what's going on half of the time.\n\nMy least favorite experience was trying to get an iPhone 5 with them. I finally was making the transition to an iPhone, but it seemed like nobody would sell me one. I had to wait 15 minutes in the acrid store for someone to tell me they're out. They are popular, I get it, but stop acting like it's a privilege to spend money at your store.\n\nApparently the best way to go about getting one is to wait until 1am, when their systems refresh, then see if you can win the race to reserve one online. Really? Okay. So I end up doing that nonsense, finally get one days later, go to the store, wait to be acknowledged, finally get help.. then they lose my reservation. Apparently it was some sort of weird glitch that \""never happens.\"" The whole experience was miserable.\n\nThey get me one, and a couple of days later, the battery is dying insanely fast. Like 4 hours fast. My boyfriend just got his weeks earlier, and his is great. So I take it back in. Wait to be acknowledged. Finally someone helps me and tells me that they are all booked up, and if I'm lucky enough, they might be able to help me over at another location if I go in and check.\n\nSo to end this sob story, the customer service is terrible, especially considering that you're paying a premium for the brand. If their \""Genius Bar\"" is fully booked because they're soooo popular, then Apple needs to hire more people so that they can handle walk ins AND appointments. I went because my phone was sold to me defective and couldn't even get help. If you ever need a repair, don't take it here, they charge an insanely high fee for everything. That is, if you're lucky enough to have them look at your equipment."
1,"While visiting St. Andrews Cathedral and Castle, hubby and I wanted a simple quick hot lunch (50s in June is still cold for Americans). Zest served that exact purpose. We ordered at the counter and was informed when the food was ready. Our lunch consisted of lentil soup and sandwiches. My curry sandwich was especially yummy without the overpowering taste of the curry spice. The big windows brought a lot of light into the restaurant which is somehow the perfect setting for a light lunch. \nI noticed the sign said Zest juicing & coffee bar, sadly I didn't have room left for any juice, but if you are visiting Zest, at least you know that option is available for you."
1,"I had the Andy's chicken! Crazy huge portion! Amazing presentation! My hubby had the chorizo hash....he said it was ok. He ate half of mine. Had a yummy butterscotch espresso, yum! Oj was fresh and yummy! A Vegas must go to breakfast place! Then go walk 5 miles! Totally worth it though. Service was good. I think I'll venture to the San Diego location with my family this summer! We got there at about 10:15 on a Sunday and got seated right away. When we left the wait was insane!"
0,"Great location in Verona!  The bar is beautiful and they pour a large glass of wine for a good price.  Food is marginal at best, but not consistent.  The only thing I enjoy eating is the cheese bread."
1,"Was close by for a doctor's appointment and yelp introduced me to this place & I fell in love with the place. Exceptional food and service, one of the best meals I have ever had in my life."
1,"Brooklyn Bowl. Now this place is awesome! I always say you can trust a place w/ PBR on tap and my rule has yet to let me down lol They get some of the best shows in town and their tickets are reasonably priced (I heard locals get 2 4 1 tix if bought at the box office but always forget to ask). Combining bowling, fried chicken and live music is an interesting concept but seems to work considering this isn't their 1st rodeo w/ locations in NY and somewhere else. After many visits we broke down and tried the fried chicken (how could you not?). It was quite tasty. Not the cheapest fried chicken prices but I get it. Worth it, especially if you're already there watching or waiting for your band. \n The bowling is cool too. I heard there are like 30 lanes in there but don't know where they're hiding them all. A cool feature is if you get a lane while a concert is going on they broadcast a live feed on the big screens that sit above the end of each lane, looks cool. If you forget to wear shes w/ socks you can score a pair but they'll run ya like $6 (ouch!).\n\nThey have a decent draft selection w/ both PBR & Stella making the cut and being somewhat affordable, so kudos to that. PBR weighing in at $6 and all other beers I think are $7. Mixed wells drinks will run you $12. Their gried chicken (what they're known for) is pricey as fux but equally as good. 8 piece of dark will run ya $24, $26 for mixed & $28 for all white. They have the shoe string fries and for $4 they're worth it. I saw calamari on the menu and we were hella tempted but had already ordered all that other goodness and for $14.50 was too much for us to add to the tab. C'mon, we need room for drinks too."
0,"I had to go home and re-shave.\n\nI scheduled an appointment for a Presidential Shave for my father, and a Presidential Shave and haircut for myself on my wedding day, with the intent of being a father-son experience.  We both had appointments scheduled for 11:00 the day of my wedding.\n\nThe facility was clean, and the staff was nice.  My father got in at 11:15, and I got in at 11:45.  Instead of us being able to experience it together, the same barber that shaved him shaved me.  So there was no experience to be had.\n\nThe worst part is, the shave was terrible.  There was still a significant amount of stubble on both of us.  My cheeks were shaved, but we both still had a 5 o'clock shadow, and even after going over my upper lip multiple times it still looked like I had not shaved.  I was expecting a ridiculously close shave since it is a professional barber shop with a straight edge but that was most certainly not the case.\n\nFor the $135 it cost for the entire package, this was not worth the time or money, especially on my wedding day.  I would recommend to anyone to save their time and money, and they will save themselves a great deal of disappointment."
1,Best birthday joint for kids under 9 in town!
1,"When I grow up, I want to live in the West End. It's more upmarket than Newington, less studenty than New Town or Marchmont, and much more central than Brunstfield or Stockbridge.  For that reason, it tends to attract the young proffessional types and so has a really nice feel to it.\n\nAnd quite apart from the practicalities, its full of gorgeous Georgian architecture and little green parks dotted about all over the place. As well as being full of great bars like the Ghillie Dhu or The Rutland, there are also lovely restaurants like La Piazza and A Room in the West End."
1,"I did a lot of research before choosing a place to get my first gel manicure, and I can't speak highly enough of Jeniza Nail Spa (and I always work with Victoria, and I'd def recommend Terri, too).  It's affordable, long lasting, very clean, and I feel comfortable there.  I will now be a regular, thanks to their fabulous service!"
1,A delightful place with a unique feature. The revolving bar goes around the tables and allows customers to take what they want when they want it. Kiku Sushi allows you to choose the sushi you want without having to order and entire plate of 6-8 pieces. You pick up the plate from the bar which gives you 2-6 pieces of sushi per plate. There is less chance of you wasting the food and a better chance of you to get only what you love and try new things. The service is friendly and helpful. They all take great care of the customer. Another great thing is that of your sushi gets taken up by other patrons you can always just ask the waitress to have the chef make you your order instead of waiting for the dish to come around. They really want to make sure everyone has a great and filling experience.
0,I use to go there often with my parents when I was a kid...early 80 and I use to love it. Unfortunately for them since that time I have been to many more restaurant and I now know better. The service was slow and I am not sure why because the place was fairly empty. The meat sauce for the pasta taste like can sauce. The pizza dough didn't look or taste like it was fully cooked and the dessert was nothing impressive. \nThey really need a blast to 2014 and fast o be able to stay open another 50 years
0,"Why always such a long wait... ??? And if waiting is forever long, why install those most uncomfortable park bench... Staffs are awful & unhelpful & slow... Really ?"
1,"Come here expecting a mixed crowd and nights where you can barely find standing room or others where you and friends are one of the only people in the place. Overall, its a great place to catch up with friends or start your long night."
0,"This should have been a better experience... \n\nI'll begin with the food.  We arrived on a Sunday afternoon after a visit to the Phoenix Art Museum.  We ordered a BLT salad off the lunch menu and a manicotti dish.  We also included a cup of the minestrone soup for a buck.  The salad was good and was accompanied by fresh, hot bread.  The minestrone soup was outstanding.  The salad and soup were brought out early, as we requested, and we had ample time to complete the salad before our entree arrived.  The manicotti was fine and a good enough portion size that we had to box some.   So far, a good dining experience.\n\nThen the bill arrives.  The salad was 8.50 and then entree was full price.  We questioned the bill, as the \""lunch menu\"" said the salad would be 5.99 and the entree 1.50 off.  The server actually apologizes and says he'll have the manager correct the mistake.  Then he comes back and tells us \""Sorry, manager says lunch prices only apply Mon-Fri\"".  Nowhere on the menu does it say lunch only applies Monday through Friday, and we were never told.  I didn't press the issue, paid the bill and off we go.  \n\nWhat could have been an overall pleasant experience ruined by what is essentially a sham.  Giving patrons a menu with lunch specials and prices and then waiting to mention \""that doesn't apply\"" until the bill arrives disgraceful.  Deceptive business practices will trump decent food every time, hence the two-stars."
1,"I went to this show for my bachelor Party this past weekend on Saturday March 2nd. It was one of the greatest shows ever!!!! I got hypnotized, and it was HILARIOUS!! Everybody had an awesome time, my friends said they have never laughed so hard!! You have to do this while you are in Vegas!! It is a must!!"
1,"Have been here several times, everything is super yummy! Have tried salads, sandwiches and smoothies all delicious. Awesome and friendly service all the time. Really glad this place is close by."
1,"Great park area!  It's always clean and very well kept. We celebrated my son first birthday at one of the pavilions and all the kids had a blast. I was lucky that someone cancelled, apparently the pavilions book months in advance.  \nThe play area is completely covered, which is a necessity once  it starts getting hot."
1,"I'm a weirdo that likes plain cupcakes. No frosting.\n\nI asked the girls at the front for my special cupcake and they seemed some what taken back. \n\n\""I dont think anyone has every asked for that. Umm.. Yeah.. I think we can do that\""\n\nBut Hooray! They came through and it was a glorious day. \nSuper moist and fluffy. \nYum Yum Yum!"
1,"Before REI had even considered opening in Phoenix, there was Arizona Hiking Shack. The staff is knowledgeable and helpful. They are very good at fitting their customers with the right gear. They make every effort to be sure that you have what you need and are prepared for your hike, climb or backpacking event. They are also a great resource for local maps and information."
0,"As all other Home Depots this places always has exactly what I need to get the job done. This issue is that the customer service is not that good. I have found myself on more than one visit here having to seek out someone with the orange apron on to find that one evasive item. Another thing that upsets me about this location is that on my last few visits I have found that the only registers available for check out are those of the self-help variety. On top of that, the one associate who is standing there avoids eye contact at all costs. Will continue to shop here because it is the closest and like I said they always have what I need so what the heck I guess."
1,My kids love it!\nBeen there a couple of times and always enjoyed the courtyard seating and the ice cream is pretty good
0,"I think this is the only 1 star review I have given out. Sadly enough it's based on customer service/service and value. I've seen the ABSURDLY expensive bottle list packages that have been circulating on the internet (i'll upload a picture) that they seem to be proud of. The cheapest one starting at $12,000 on up to $500,000!! A half million dollars for 4 hours of impressing your friends, co-workers, and Vegas hotties with how wasteful you can be. The second thing I'm rating them on is service. I showed up to check out this hot new club with a group of 11 friends, 7 girls, 4 guys. First they required a $10,000 bottle service to let us in, then after over an hour of waiting they and it was getting closer to 1 am, they came down to just cover at $150 per guy + $50 per girl, + $300 to the door guys to pass the line. Sad thing is we could have easily afforded the $10k table if we wanted, but the way they treated us and demanded it of us and acted as though we were a waste of their time. We ended up grabbing a huge limo and hitting another great club on the strip. \n\nI was really looking forward to checking this club out and now I could care less. One of my friends is even the General Manager and when he answered his cell, he said got no time & no tables then hung up on me. I guess I'm not A list famous enough to warrant their time. Sad day for Angel Mgt group!!! I really have supported you all around town and still enjoy your other locations."
0,"The room was great. It was large, clean an modern. However I am very disappointed by hidden fee I was charged on my reservation. I reserved the hotel via Expedia. The website offered a very good deal that brought the price below the price of other competitors. When I went there they told me there was a resort fee in addition to my reservation price. The final invoice ended up 20% above the original fare."
1,"Whaaaaaaaaat!! How have I not known about this place?!?! Other cities have way better options on desi food and I've always been generally disappointed in the options in and around Charlotte but this place has won me over. We tried several dishes and all were flavorful, warm, and fresh. I didn't get the \""this just came out of a can/box/whatever\"" feel from this place and I love that! The restaurant wasn't super busy around 730 on a Monday night but they did have a steady stream of customers (desi people eat late....LOL). Anyway, the servers were very attentive and quickly and efficiently brought and removed items to and from the table. Cannot wait to go back and try more dishes!"
0,"The fried calamari were pretty  pedestrian. The pasta with clams was ultra salty and impossible to eat. The pasta with asparagus didn't have any asparagus in it (well, only hard unchewable endings that you cannot even bite).\n\nWe complained to the manager about our poor experience. He was not too friendly, but to his credit he took the two pastas off the bill (hence +1 star).\n\nUPDATE: I have a suggestion to the chef. If you wish to learn how to cook mussels properly, you might consider doing an internship at Bouchon in the nearby Venetian hotel. And to learn how to prepare asparagus, consider an internship at Julian Serrano at the  Cosmopolitan. I'm sure there are many other places too :)"
1,"If I could give 4.5 I would.  Bumped up to five partially because there are very few restaurants like this in mesa.  By that I mean local,  non chain, nice decor.  Basically it has a Scottsdale feel in east mesa.  I usually get the calzone, it's enough for two to split and get full.  Don't get me started on the bread. .. the poor waiter always has to bring me a couple refills.  Pricy,  but not overpriced.  A good place to celebrate."
0,Service was very good but the food was very expensive and pretty bland. No salt & pepper to be found :(
1,This was an awesome show!! It was worth the money. Terry was really funny and talented.  It amazes me how he hits those notes as a ventriloquist.   Would definitely do it again.
1,"I had a great experience. I waited a LONG time before getting my legs waxed and she was very nice about it. She even offered a touch up next week.  Made me feel so comfy and I will be back for sure! For just meeting someone and lying there in my underwear, it felt like she was family. I will not go anywhere else!!! You shouldn't either!"
1,"Very nice little ice cream place. They only have soft serve ice cream, but you get to choose your dip and the toppings. I've only been once so have yet to try all the dips but i was very happy with my first experience. The ice cream itself is what you would expect (it's classic soft serve), but the chocolate/caramel dip with bits of crushed Oreos was awesome.\nI will definitely go back the next time I'm craving some sweetness!"
0,I had the regular spaghetti with marinara and meatballs. And the meatballs were good with the sauce but the sauce alone with the noodles was HORRIBLE the marinara sauce tasted like packaged ketchup from in n out! If I were you I would just order the Alfredo like this old man was raving about in the restaurant or have the famous baked spaghetti but I've had way better! I'm never going there again customers were giving me weird looks... So overall my experience at this restaurant was uncomfortable and the food tasted like a frozen meal cooked in a microwave! Do not eat here!!!! I'd rather eat a gas station mexican breakfast burrito
1,Grapefruit served squeezed\nA very fluffy pancake\nWhat a great ham steak\n--\nQuality is guaranteed here.
0,"What a disappointment this place was. I am a Hilton Honors Diamond Member and stay in Hilton properties at least 2 nights a week. From the moment I walked in the door I had the feeling they could give a rats ass whether I was there or not. I was told at the front desk that I was in one of the nicer remodeled rooms. The room I was in hadn't been remodeled in at least 10 years it was clean but was worn out. In every hilton property I stay in there is always a welcome letter and a few treats waiting for me in my room, not this place. The only part of my visit that was halfway decent was the complimentary buffet breakfast that was offered for gold and diamond HH club members, I will add that if I had to pay for it I would not have been happy. I wanted to order pan cakes off the menu and the waitress told me I would have to pay al-carte  for them. I was ok with that until I found out they were $11. Yes I said $11 for a side order of pancakes. To add insult to injury I signed up for the players club which is totally misleading, don't waste your time and have never done so badly on slots in my life and tried my luck 3 different times. I stayed 4 nights and when I was checking out I saw a VIP sign on a door behind the front desk marked Gold and Diamond HH Club Members. I inquired with front desk clerk and he said oh yes that is for our HIlton Honors Club Members there are free drink and d'oeuvres nightly. It would have been nice if someone had pointed that out when I checked in rather than when I checkout. My advice is stay away from this place there are too many nice places in Vegas to stay and this is not one of them."
1,"Dr. Sam and his staff are very professional, courteous, and friendly. Growing up I always dreaded going to the dentist because of all the pain associated with the cleanings and fillings. However now,  I am very comfortable in the care of Dr. Partovi and his staff. Each time I visit, they make me at ease, and always provide great service. My husband and two children are also Dr. partovi's patients, and they are very satisfied with him and his dental office."
0,"Wow, so my booking at the Luxor was a real last minute move.  Booked my room via MLife dept, and no complaints...the rates were great considering it was a few days before the New Year...$39 and $43, respectively, for two nights.\n\nCheck In...up to the Room\n\nThere wasn't a huge line for check-in, although when I was called up next, the check in agent couldn't have been more rude, and stuck up.  A real dick....he didn't even confirm with me what type of room I'd be staying in, but I didn't say anything because I wanted to test his customer service skills. He told me that I'd be staying in the LAST non-smoking room in the entire resort, which I thought, that's completely bull!  So grabbed the keys, and off to the room, and WTF, the room wasn't even clean at all. Towels all over the floor, empty coffee cups laying around, pillows on the floor....ummm, say what?! I called front desk right away from the room, and demanded that they give me a different room, and that I wouldn't be willing to come down to the check in desk.  They assigned me to a different room, and when i arrived at my new room, the key wouldn't work.  Again, I complained heavily, and said that this was unacceptable.  They sent some guy with the new keys, and he wouldn't be apologetic on behalf of the hotel. I told him, \""Wait, don't leave til my keys work.\""  He tried to run off, and i told him, \""Don't you see that this is terrible service?\""  His response, \""I'm just doing what my supervisor told me to do.\""  I thought in my mind, \""You're a real loser.\""\n\nOk, so they gave me a new room--much better...clean as expected, and double beds.\nSince my friend and I weren't in the room most of the time, didn't really care much for the room, since we got the room to sleep, and shower.\n\nOverall, my biggest gripe about this hotel, is with its horrible service.  Don't ever want to stay here again. Not worth my money.  $20 to $30 more, and stay at the Mirage."
1,"You bring new meaning to Tex Mex cuisine.   I loved everything.   \n\n I made reservations  for our party of 4 and sadly enough we were late from all the traffic and parking fiasco.   But along the way, we called and informed them and the host accepted it as calm as can be.   So getting there about 30 minutes late for our 8:30 dinner reservation, we had to wait about 5 minutes till our party was complete.   Right then and there they led us to our table and offered for drinks on the spot.   Hello tequila!   Yes, they have a great selection and the margaritas are just golden.   Mixed sweet and it's got the kick.   Our waiter introduced himself and informed us about the wine list. He even pointed out some of the specific details of the tequila list and explained some of the items on the menu. The bread basket was good, but I was mostly impressed with the customer service and the interior.   We skipped the appetizer and decided to go for the entree since we had to catch up with our schedule for the club.   I opted for the Grilled Lamb Porterhouse Chops.   This is where BF's talent in his signature sauces come in.   Simple presentation, just grilled with a side of Tamale and the meat in the center.   The flavors come together and heaven came down to earth.   It was a balance of meatiness, salt, sweet, spice, and a tang of goodness. It looked like I can finish the plate, but wow was I wrong.   That portion was a lot for one person to conquer.   Next time I'll try the seafood. \n\nI'll be back Mesa, I'll make sure to leave my hotel an hour before considering the strip traffic and the parking.   There are three places to valet park and the best one is all the way in the back closest to the restaurant."
1,"Let me start by saying that having come from the San Francisco Bay Area...I'm spoiled by all the awesome choices for food and services.\nBut being new to Phoenix, it's been a challenge to find all the good stuff.\nI hope my YELP's will help other newbies  (^_^)\n\nI must have tried no less that 7 nail salons before I found Oceans.\nThis place is great. They have 10 spa pedi chairs and 8 nail tables as well as a cute nail drying station for your toes.\n\nTHE best pedi I've ever had, anywhere. There is no timer on the pedi, or the massage. They take the time they need to satisfy each client.\nI've had 6 or 8 different girls and they were all really good.\n\nI also use them to do my gel nails too. I'm a little surprised that in Phoenix they charge extra fro the gel coat, but I guess that's what they do. \n\nOverall, good prices and the service is excellent!\n\n$$$  Discount for cash!!   $$$"
1,"Came here on a 4 day 3 night package deal that was incredibly affordable with the mandatory Timeshare Presentation\n\nSix of us got a banging two-bedroom suite equipped with Jacuzzi, washer/dryer, projector, full-sized kitchen, king-sized beds, and a decent view - We were on the 14th floor facing an empty parking lot but still, we weren't in the hotel room for most of the trip.\n\nPros: \n-BEST deal ever.

You're on vacation; I'm sure you can afford to give away some change money\n-Earlier Check-in available on a first-come first-serve basis\n-Free luggage storage available for early arrivals or late flights - a real added convenience!\n\nThank you for a pleasant and wonderful stay!"
1,"Great place to start your night.\n\nThe concept is awesome, great beer and bar snacks. I particularly love that they have nitro beers which not a lot of places are willing deal with outside of Guiness.\n\nThe beer prices are going to be on the higher end so just a heads up.\n\nWe always come here while we put in our name at Crepe Celler and it's a great start and transition for the night.\n\nIt gets a bit crowded, so I find I have a better time standing up and working the bar than the whole booth / waitress situation. \n\nFantastic spot in the heart of NoDA."
0,"Atmosphere =F\nWait Staff and Greeter Girl=D\nBus boy/chip boy=A+\n\nI went to dinner with  my kids tonight and the girl who sat us couldn't even smile just a little...she almost seemed annoyed that we walked in the front door.  We were seated and weren't acknowledged for a good 6 o 7 minutes.  The bus boy saw this and immediately brought chips...still no waiter.  After my son tried the hot salsa he was gasping and turning red dying for some water that the bus boy came over and took our drink order and gave us a menu\nThe waiter came over 2 seconds after that and asked if we were ready to order...we only had the menu for 2 to 3 seconds so no we weren't ready to order.  He said he come back....we waited for him to come back for over 10 minutes.  By the way, there was only 5 other tables being sat at...the restaurant was empty.  Our waiter NEVER smiled...seemed grumpy that he was working.  \n\nDid I tell you the bus boy/chip boy was great!!!  If it wasn't for him I would have left 1 star!  The food was just OK.  My sons got chicken tenders and fries and it tasted like the fryer hadn't been cleaned in weeks...UGH...soggy flat fries and the tenders turned a dark brown color from dirty fryer oil.\n\nNeedless to say I won't be coming back.  Hope the owner looks at these reviews and does something positive....the restaurant needs some spunk/life to it.  Just very drab and plain like the wait staff!"
1,"My only wish was that FnB was a little closer. Otherwise, I really cannot fault the restaurant for anything. The portions are manageable, the prices are right, and the flavors are outstanding. \n\nThe staff truly has a knack for making you feel welcome and comfortable. The dishes were seasoned perfectly and accompanied each other very well. The only item I did not care for were the fried oysters, as the texture of oysters usually make me cringe. However, that does not mean that they are not good, its just that they did not leave an impression on me and that's just a personal preference.\n\nI left FnB very satisfied. I would go there every night if I could and if the distance did not matter. Pavle and Emily, thank you for bringing a culinary delight into the Old Town Scottsdale spotlight. I wish you continued success."
1,"I was so looking forward our dinner here. I took my husband here for his 30th birthday and I waited for this day like a kid that's ready to meet Mickey & Co.    Few hours prior to our dinner, I ended up having the worst stomach ache and I couldn't even try anything, other then a bite of caviar(YUMMO), a bite of his lobster dish.   Shame, Shame, Shame (on me).\nHe ended up polishing 12 course meal all by himself and walked out of there like he just had the best sex ever. I'm sure it was orgasmic by his reaction. Since I can't speak too much for the food, I will just say their decor was over the top and the service was bit \""smothering\"" to say the least.  Our waiter literally stood right next to our table while we were eating the entire time (while I was sipping on hot water/lemon).  \nOhhhh.. and the candy wagon they brought out at the end. OMG!!!!!"
1,"everything about this place is simply \""awesome\"".\nspent an afternoon with my man gary and my dearest friend tangie for a bite to eat and delicious mixed drinks.\nwe had the place to ourselves before people began rolling in.\ni cannot say anything negative when this is a sister restaurant to one of my favorite hangouts \""AZ88\"".\nevery bite brought out each rich flavor - exquisite.\nevery drink brought through delicious-deliciousness. love the mojito.\nambiance, service, layout and design, and the history of the building is more than inviting.\ni am going back for more - when i am in town!"
0,"I've been here a couple times, not looking for anything in particular. It's a large space and fairly clean and bright but for some reason this place really skeeves me out. I can't quite put my finger on what it is though.\n\nThe women's section is fairly large. The last day that I went, skirts were pretty sold down the \""non-summer clothing\"" was abundant. The men's section looks limited but I didn't take the time to walk through it. Kid's was fairly limited as well.\n\nI usually enjoy thrift store shopping and searching through the racks to find that one awesome piece of clothing, but this location doesn't really have that going on...at least not for me anyway."
0,This buffet was disgusting. I have never wasted so much food in my life. Everything was very bland. Flavorless. Even the desserts were a huge let down. A bunch of nasty cupcakes and flan that tasted like nothing at all. Don't waste your money here.
0,"They didn't know what a hot toddy is. And the coffee was cold. I know this is Arizona but c'mon, it's December."
1,"I haven't had a good gyro in a several years.  This place is quite good!  The smell alone should sell you.  Almost everything was under $5, too!  The price and the food makes this one of my favorites.  In fact, this is my first Yelp post as this place was good enough to make me want to share it!"
1,"This place was fun! The atmosphere was great. Service was fantastic!\n\nI tried the Shepherds pie with cheese on top. It was tasty and a good portion.\n\nI also had the Irish Nachos, which were good, but I prefer them from my local pub where they use real cheese and bacon instead of chicken and fake cheese sauce.\n\nAsparagus was delicious and a great compliment to all the heavy fried stuff!\n\nMac and cheese was tasty but in all truth- could have used more cheese! Let's highlight the star of the dish people!\n\n\nI'm definitely coming back!"
0,I go here because everywhere else has a line. I can walk in here at 7 on Saturday night and there are maybe 40 people here. Most of those are at the bar trying to hit on the waiters who are not doing there jobs. The food is OK.  Its frozen food but its just OK.  The waiters are always talking to each other rather paying attention to our needs.
0,"C'est vraiment un beau restaurant, ya une belle ambiance, le service est bon mais le rapport qualit\u00e9 prix n'est simplement pas l\u00e0. \n\nC'est plate quand tu fini ton assiste en te disant tu aurais pu avoir mieux pour beaucoup moins cher. \n\nVraiment d\u00e9\u00e7u."
1,"When it's after midnight, and I'm looking for something to eat, I find myself drawn to the Landmark like a moth to flame. The place is grubby in the way that only a 24 hour diner can accomplish, but it's a grubby I've come to love.\n\nThe staff is friendly when it's not too busy, and you can expect them to want to chat. \n\nThe menu is giant...it's like 2 feet tall and 15 pages long. You can get breakfast at midnight or have dinner at 6 a.m. The dinner and lunch entrees vary from Greek and Italian home-style specialties to classic American diner grub (burgers, steaks, fries, etc.)\n\nSince I do the vegetarian thing, my favorites are the breakfast items and the Spanakopita. The Spanakopita dish comes with a lovely Greek side salad. I also like their stuffed grape leaves, even though I'm pretty sure that they came out of a jar. \n\nTheir cakes and pies are a little prettier than they are delicious, but really, even a pie that isn't perfect is still a delicious pie...You just can't go wrong with cake and sugary frosting. I tend to forgo the desserts, however, to save more room inside my guts for dinner."
1,"Floyd's is our favorite restaurant in the valley. We eat there at least a couple of times per week. We don't even need to look at the menu anymore. Everything is delicious!!!!!! Amazing food, friendly service and the place is really cute. You see a lot of the same people in there. Kind of like a \""Cheers\"" atmosphere. The restaurant is named after the owner's dog. I think that's really cute. If you haven't tried it, you must. It will be your favorite place too. ENJOY!!!!!!!!"
1,"The girls here are so nice and very beautiful! I have never had such nice service. Also, best tanning deals in Tempe AZ!!"
1,"We looked in at Jet, which had a line that was \""a couple of hours.\"" My friends had been here once or twice, so we decided to come over here instead. Good decision... I didn't realize it was so big inside. No cover, drinks are expensive but you can quite easily get some nice gentleman to buy for you ;D It was a good crowd, nice and packed but not overcrowded. Overall, all four of us had a really good time."
0,"really disappointed in my last experience.  lost items i had won because they claimed there was a credit card issues on a card i had used with them many times before that had no chance of being declined.  probably 75% of the electronics i have purchased here have been unusable.  a few deals to be had, but like all auctions this is buyer beware.  out of probably 30 laptops purchased there, not a single one has worked without a large amount of parts and work.  cell phones are usually reported lost/stolen."
1,"I took my phone out while walking around. \""No photography in the store, hun,\"" to which I replied that I was not. \""I know, sweetheart, I'm just sayin', there's no photography in the store, honey.\"" \n\nIt's hard enough being a woman that can fix her own car stuff. Being called pet names by strange women does not help. \n\nI contacted corporate and told them that the whole experience made me feel very uncomfortable. \n\nThis is where the obviously one star review turns into a five star review. The general manager was awesome in apologizing and assured me that she would receive some coaching on subtlety and proper behavior.\n\nThat really makes up for it. My greatest fear was that it was a given that if you're a woman in Autozone you're going to encounter condescending employees. I really felt like he was concerned and wanted that to not be the case.\n\nThanks for caring, AutoZone!"
1,"If you try nothing else, make sure to have the corn. It's amazing!  Great service, food and drinks."
0,"The worst pizza I have ever had. I ordered delivery for my friends and I the pizza shows up over 30 minutes after an initial wait time of 1 hour... So it took 1.5 hours. The pizza was soggy and greasy, the wings were hard and fatty.\n\nHonestly it sucked and I feel like I got ripped off - not to mention all the apologies and feeling like a horrible host to my friends. I called back and explained, but they seemed like high school phone girls who don't understand I can care less about getting a discount on my next purchase because I'm not going to order this EVER again. Personally I thought it would be a step up from dominos but I was proved wrong.. Now I know 2 pizza places that deliver to my house and suck.\n\nI've had celery before, but celery in a plain brown bag ( with no container just a dirty ragged brown bag) is a first for me. As much as this placed made me nauseated and they can't take the horrid taste out of my mouth they did reach a new low for me in terms of pizza/service."
0,"My friends and I were beyond excited to try this spot out.  We've heard great things about the one in LA.\n\nGranted we had the last reservation, so that may have something to do with the issues we had.  We ordered the tart and cheese platter as appetizers.  Both good, but nothing to rave about.  We were given bread for the table that was as hard as a rock.\n\nOur entrees took close to an hour to arrive.  We ordered the pork chop (which the waiter raved about), the risotto, and the salmon.  The pork chop was so chewy and hard to cut.  The risotto was served like tatter tots, fried into three tiny pieces on my plate.  The salmon was practically raw and still cold.  We sent all three dishes back.  A first ever.\n\nThe manager there at the time handled the situation very well and comped our appetizers.  Just maybe I'll return based on their customer service, but we did need to go find dinner after!"
1,"We are happy with this new pizza spot!  We stopped here on the way back from hiking Cathedral Rock at Mt. Charleston.  Eric R. was hungry for pizza and I had noticed this on yelp yesterday.  We hardly get to the west side so we went this direction post-hike.  Eric R. was pleased with unlimited toppings at a flat rate ($8.95).  They eventually will have wheat and gluten-free dough but today was just the regular.\n\nI got the spicy diavolo sauce (tasted it first - whew nice and spicy!) and a combo of mozzarella and jack cheese.  Then, the only non-pork protein option: chicken.  My veggies...basil, roasted red peppers, artichokes, caramelized onions, roasted garlic, sundried tomatoes, jalepenos, sundried tomato oil....I think that is it :)  After it came out of the oven, they zinged it with cilantro.\n\nIt was pretty quick, with a charred crust and 4 big slices.  It theoretically could be 8.  I ate 5/8ths of the pizza before saving the rest for my lunch tomorrow.  Eric R. enjoyed his pizza and saved some too.  It is quite filling!  He was happy with sample breadsticks at the cash register before we got our pies.  While eating we ran into friends who happen to live near the restaurant.  The owner came around and gave us a charred pizza dough roll stuffed with marshmallows and nutella for a free dessert sample - and it was like s'mores!!!  MMM!\n\nI definitely am impressed with the freshness and quickness of the pizza.  They did offer half off pies for dads today, which is nice.  Everyone working there is very friendly and takes pride in what they offer.  When we return to the west side, we will definitely stop  here!"
1,"Went there for the all you can eat pancakes and was absolutely impressed the first day.  Second day, not so much.  Food was great both days, but the service was hit or miss.  \n\nIt was great to find a place on the strip that didn't cost and arm AND a leg to eat at."
1,Four words: Italian Special Garlic Bread. Scrumptious. The place is a decent value if you get the large and share. Average sandwich shop decor. Super friendly grey haired owner/manager as well as the one male employee who I swear has been there forever. Always forget to get a coupon. I see them in Airpark News.
0,"Being a former Starbucks manager, i admit to being a tad picky when it comes to my Starbucks. With this location though, it seems they need to get it together. Every time I go, they are out of what I want. Sausage breakfast sandwiches are out at 10:30. That used to be a big deal when I was a manager. If we were out of something we exercised customer recovery. At this location...we play the guessing game and go through the list to see what they don't have and what they do have. Then I get a half \""sorry\"". They also charge me for things I ask for and I get home and realize i don't have them. Like an extra cream cheese or an extra shot of espresso. The reason I gave it two stars is because the baristas are usually pretty friendly."
1,"I had an AWESOME beef salad here, the hubby had the shaken beef (he was going to try the short ribs, but they don't make them anymore) and his was very good, also, I was gobbling his onions up :) I have had the Pho before and I thought it was great, but I have only had Pho a few times so I don't have a lot to compare it to, still I really really enjoyed it, very flavorful and very good flavor... We will be back for sure! This is one of only a few places out here that we actually enjoy a lot."

1,Not Only do they make the absolute best donuts and pastries in the whole metro area the couple that own and run the business exemplify the meaning of American small business !!   Go there now. Spend all your money!!!!  Be happy all day!!!!!!
1,Good standard Pho place. Cheap and tasty. Really hit the spot for brunch after a long night out the day before. Saw that they even have personal grills available for your table too.
0,"I think they must write their own reviews. Just a very average place. I just had lunch, wafer thin chicken breast, so over cooked I could barely cut it , with frozen seasoned fake fries. \nI have had breakfast here once and that was so so too. Over rated!"
0,"Will not go back to this location! I have had great experiences at Park Road and order take-out quite often from there. The Providence Road location always under-cooks. I said I wouldn't go back but decided to give it one more try this past weekend because it's close to our house.  My Calzone was wrong, only had cheese in it and was still doughy. The pizza we ordered was also still doughy. I hadn't ate all day and just ate it and went to bed. Big disappointment at this location! I will not give it another chance."
0,"Some time had gone by since my last visit to Kohler and I felt like giving it another chance. A Groupon was available so I purchased the deal and headed back to Kohler with a friend who goes there regularly and we spent the morning getting a facial and a manicure.\n\nThe facial - I get facials often at other places and know the general routine. The tech was sweet but she did not explain what she was doing to me, ask me questions, recommend products, etc. There also was really no privacy for taking off/putting on clothes, etc other than a sheer curtain that did not cover my treatment space. She also did not do extractions even after her instructor told her too. However, in the end I still left feeling clean and moisturized. The next day I woke up and I was broken out all over my face AND my chest. I have never broken out on my chest in my entire life. It has taken almost two weeks for my skin to clear. I have no idea what products they used but clearly it was not right for my skin. \n\nThe manicure - Much better this time, but the polish was still way too thick. Three hours later I had three chips and I had done nothing but have a late lunch, do some light shopping, and drive home. The next day the polish looked so bad I had to take it off.\n\nBottom line - I will never be returning to Kohler again, no matter how great the deal is. You get what you pay for."
1,"I would totally stay at New York, New York again. We upgraded our room  so we could have a view of the strip. Although a little pricey, the room was big for a hotel room with floor to ceiling windows which gave us amazing views. Not a lot of time was spent in the hotel room, but the views at night left amazing memories. \n\nI was warned by a friend that the roller coaster is noisey but it was actually pretty silent, it was never loud enough to bother or wake us up. The friends we went with were pretty stoked to hear that you can ride the roller coaster for free if you stay at the hotel (i think its about $10 to ride the roller coaster normally).\n\nThe beds were really comfortable with super soft sheets. I never sleep good on hotel beds but I actually had a really amazing sleep the nights we were there. The room was always nice and clean, as well as the rest of the hotel. \n\nAs for downstairs, theres a Espn sports club as well as a Coyote Ugly. Dont forget tons among tons of slot machines and card tables, but since its NYNY there are New York facades that have breakfast and lunch foods for pretty reasonable prices. Its really cool to walk around down there before adventuring onto the strip. On the same floor as the arcade, theres a Nathans NY Hot Dogs that has amazing chili dogs, hamburgers, chili fries etc. \n\nNYNY is definitely worth checking out."
0,"Horrible food. My bun was hard and the onion rings tasted like old grease. They forgot my husband's french fries and of course, we didn't realize it until we were down the road. Will not return."
0,"I was really excited about this hole-in-the-wall after reading all the reviews for 3 cup tofu and a great bar menu, but I was terribly disappointed with the food, service, and atmosphere. The server did not hear my order of one entree apiece, so when only one came out I passed the first 3 cup tofu onto my husband while I waited for my order to be placed a second time. After a few bites of his plate I wished I hadn't ordered a second. The tofu was alright - dense, overly gingered, sweet, and oily. The cucumber salad was like a too-vinegary version of kim chee and he wouldn't eat it. We ended up with two plates of obnoxious and overly seasoned tofu and veggies. The mussels appetizers smelled like Red Tide dead fish in the Florida Keys (perhaps if we hadn't omitted the cream sauce it would have covered the foul smell) and single spring roll per $4 order was kind of puny. The waitress balked at having to provide a receipt (thanks goodness I was prepared for the cash-only policy) and then \""forgot\"" that I gave her $60 instead of $40. And the music consisted of a soul mashup CD on repeat. I definitely heard the same track 3x. I enjoyed my Sazerac, and I better for $8 a pop. Overall it was a terribly  disappointing experience."
1,This place is very clean and the service is very fast. Try the Low-Fat blueberry muffin. It is to die for. Download the Dunkin Donuts app to get coupons.
1,"It's still as divey as ever here at La Bayou Casino.  It's run down, cramped and there's dusty stuff all over the walls and ceilings.  God knows I love this place!  It's one of the coolest places in downtown Vegas and they always get my business.\n\nFrom the time you walk in the door and get your beads and raffle ticket till the time you leave, it's non-stop free drinks, cool employees and loose slots.\n\nYou know how most casinos only offer you free drinks when you are playing the $1 slots or better.  Not here!  I walked up, got some Mardi Gras beads and before I could sit down they asked me what I wanted to drink.  I hadn't gotten half way done and she are offering me another drink.  These ladies usually come by about once every 10 minutes so drink fast and get your moneys worth.  By the way, these aren't pussy drinks either - you can taste the alcohol.\n\nTheir slot machines are usually pretty loose (not this time but usually).  The machines are retro coin payers so don't be looking for slots with tie ins to the latest movies or TV shows and be sure to have a cup or two handy for your big win.\n\nLike I said before, I'm still loving Barbara (manager) and Mary Ellen (cashier).  They are part of the experience and if they ever leave, the place just won't be the same.\n\nMan I want to go back there right now."
1,Shortly after my plane landed we headed to Chompie's because we saw the Man vs. Food challenge. \n\nWe ordered the Reuben sandwich to split and a Jewish slider.\nMan was it enough food. \n\nThe classic reuben was delicious to say the least.\nPretty sure I had the best fries I've ever had as well. \nThe slider was very very good \n\nPlease go to Chompie's.
0,"LuckyRice is a great concept. They have many well-known culinary artists serve their signature dishes in one venue. However, the planning for this event is lacking. \n\nWhen you can bear a long line to get a small portion it is very rewarding. However, places like Raku and Bombay had lines extending hundreds of feet! WAY too many people! When you expect an event where for $85 (or $125 VIP) you can eat and drink as much as you want, you don't envision fighting a mob to get to the vendors. Some vendors closed early, so the mobs hoarded those who were still serving...\n\nI loved the foods and drinks I could get, but be prepared to fight for it!"
0,"Save your $$$$!!!\n\nWe came here this past Sunday night for their famous Frozen Hot Chocolate.  If you don't know what it is, it's just a Chocolate Milkshake....without the ice cream.  We waited in line for 10 minutes just to place our order.  Here's why...there was one girl taking orders....and the SAME girl making the drinks!  Now after placing our order, apparently, workers inside saw the huge line building up outside the \""take-out\"" window, and one extra person decided to help out.  Funny, because through the pick-up window, we could hear him talking $hit about the girl (the one taking orders) with another co-worker!  After all this $hit talking, our drink was ready.  For $15 (for a double), this is EXTREMELY overpriced!!  And I do mean EXTREMELY!!!  I'm not 100% sure, but I'm pretty sure there isn't supposed to be ice chunks in it.  I was basically chewing my drink.  WTF??!?!\n\nIf you're looking for a frozen drink, I'd suggest going to Starbucks and getting a Frappacino....or better yet, go to Coffee Bean and get one of their blended drinks.  Granted, it will be more expensive than your local SB or CB, but it'll still be cheaper, faster, and more importantly, TASTIER!\n\nAvoid this place!  If you really want to try one, I'd suggest stopping by one of their locations in NYC."
1,This place is amazing! This is my favorite sandwich place! Everyone in there is super friendly and nice! Also their very quick! Highly recommend this place if your craving a sandwich!!
0,I don't know why this place has 4 stars.  It's Applebee's food with Ruth Chris prices.  With many other options in the near area defiantly walk on bye.
1,Great sushi and great fried rice. Customer service was very good which I don't typically find here in Las vegas. The girls at the counter were SOOO friendly and helpful! I really enjoyed the food and the place was very clean and nicely decorated. Great place for quick Asian food as you order at the counter rather than waiting for a server. LOVED IT!
0,This place is okay nothing really good to talk about.
1,Dr. Sura and her staff are the best.  I have been taking my dog there for years.  The prices are reasonable and I can always get an appointment when I need one.  I do participate in the wellness plan because it is a good deal if you take your pet for regular health care.  It also saves you money if your pet requires prescription food.  Most of all Dr. Sura discovered a cancerous tumor in my dog and because of her quick action she made a quick recovery and is still cancer free one year later.  I highly recommend Family Pet Hospital.
0,Don't waste your precious buffet dollars here. Go anywhere else on the Strip for a wider selection.
1,"I love this place. It's probably the best thing that has happened to an airport. Just imagine a great place for food, not expensive, and inside an airport... Usually, you have these chains and generic restaurants in there but not at Sky Harbor. There's an LGO.\n\nThere's already an LGO \""intersection\"" in Phoenix with the pizzeria, bakery, burger place and grocery. The food is great there. I compared the prices at the airport with the regular prices and they were the same! You would figured that you would get charged an arm and a leg because it's inside an airport. But no... great food, same price.\n\nI love the English muffins, the Kale salad and pizza. The sea salt chocolate chip cookie is good too. So if you are in Terminal 4 flying Southwest, you can head toward Gates C-D and grab some good food. It's worth the walk... or a ride on the moving walkway. You'll get there in like 2 minutes!\n\nThe food is really good, the price is fair, the staff is great, and you have a HUGE variety of items to choose from on the menu. Sandwiches, pastries, pizza, salad, soup, etc. Go try it out next time, and then go to the regular LGO location too. You'll love that you did. :)"
0,"I've already posted this review for the location at Bell and 7th Ave, but thought I needed to post it again since we took our dog here, too.\n\nThis \""pet hospital\"" is a scam and a total waste of money. Their vets seem like they barely passed vet school. We took our wonderful dog, Duke, into them when he developed a lump on his side. After taking x-rays, blood tests, etc., the vet told us that the lump was \""a medical mystery\"". Prior to this, we had signed up for their pet wellness plan. In short, we took our dog to a reliable, trustworthy vet (Dr. Ryan at Blue Cross Vet Clinic) and it turned out he had bone cancer :-(. He ended up passing away this summer, yet my husband and I are still being forced to pay for our Banfield pet wellness plan each month, even though our dog is dead. Thanks, Banfield."
1,LOVE LOVE LOVE IT!  I love the chicken corn tortilla tacos...along with a big cup of iced tea!  I always get in and out of this location! Good job!
0,pls have a menu on here!!!!!
0,I have had DIRECTV  before it was called that. I installed the receiver and dish myself where it would not be bothered by anything. So I upgraded to HD DIRECTV. They sent an installer out. He put the dish where trees would grow in front of it. Not where I had installed the dish clear of any blockage. So now I get to watch a TV service that goes in and out because of loss of signal. Simply because the DIRECTV  installer would not put the receiver where I wanted it.
1,Great massages!
0,Friendly service. Small town feel. Bad food.
0,"This is one of the worst dining experiences my wife and I had. Service was lousy, slow. My coaster fell on floor and the Waitress picked it up off the floor put it back on the table. And the food when it came out was overcooked I had the chicken it was dry my wife had meatloaf it was also dry. Also when we are waiting for appetizer it was taking a long time so I went to the restroom and I saw my waitress with appetizer in hand having a conversation with her coworker."
1,"A solid 4 stars.  See my tip also posted below.\n\nChicken chimi, enchilada style - 4 1/2 stars...full of chicken, crispy, tasty.  Oh, and be warned, it is BIG!  I had to ask for the shredded lettuce though.\n\nBeans - the refried beans were pretty good.  A bit salty though.\n\nRice - see beans comment.\n\nI really liked the chimi.  Best I've had since I lived in Tucson.  I'll be back to try other items."
0,"I'm giving it two stars for the customer service, the staff was super friendly.  There's a fast food Mexican restaurant (with drive thru) I can get better & cheaper fish tacos from. The taco was dry and I didn't care for the red sauce on it (I guess it was salsa?) I'm surprised by all the positive reviews."
0,Wait to go here. They do not have the ability to handle a Friday night. Had reservations for 730. Left at 815. Not once did a manager come out to explain or apologize. Hopefully they will figure it out.
1,"So this was my first time, in a very long time, that I've stayed at the Venetian hotel.  My friends apparantly got a great deal via Priceline, and since I was the 5th person to jump in on the trip, the split after 5 people was not bad...$80 for 2 nights.\n\nFirst Impressions\n\nAs one of Vegas' best resorts on the strips, I was impressed with the grounds, and the layout of the casino area, but in all honesty, I wasn't impressed with the layout and the floorplan of the hotel side.  It was ridiculously confusing to get to the room, almost as if you're trying to get thru a maze, with two different elevators, and what not.  It simply wasn't cut to the chase--and yes, I did get used to it after a while, but getting to the room was just overall confusing.\n\nThe Room\n\nThe room was absolutely beautiful--lots of space, two flat screens, comfortable beds, amazing bathrooms with granite counter tops, big tub, and separate area for the toilet.  Very clean, and spacious.\n\nService\n\nService was 7/10.  Why? Well, for the most part, the staff was great--top notch and efficient, and no problems, but where I ran into problems was with the bell service.\nIt's ridiculously hot in Vegas, yet at the same time, the waiting area is outside, and so there's a crowd of people waiting for their bags to be brought up, and the service was quite inefficient.  Just as an advice, give yourself a good 1/2 hr to 45 minutes if you plan to request for your bags to be brought up to the valet area, since there's a long wait.  Don't plan yourself 10 minutes before, with an hour before to head back to McCarren. \n\nOverall\n\nWas satisfied, though in my book, the Bellagio still beats the Venetian in a lot of areas--the location of the Venetian, being on the north end, makes it hard to trek your way to the center/south end.  \n\nOverall Grade:   B+/A-"
0,"I feel similarly with some of the 2-3 star reviews I've read-- not horrid, not great. To be honest, if the windows had been clean (in our pyramid suite) this would have bumped up a star or two. No matter how great the amenities are inside (which were very standard fyi), its hard to feel any sort of luxury when the windows are filthy disgusting and its the only way to get some light into the room. We kept our shades drawn when there was light out so I wouldn't gag while looking out. At least at night we had the lights of the Mandarin out the window, not that we were there much at night but to sleep...\n\nOtherwise, the staff was all friendly and accommodating. There's a little cafe/restaurant located by elevator 2 that we wished we would have found several days prior than we did... decent food at decent prices with lots of breakfast, lunch & dinner options for a quick meal without dropping a benny. \n\nAll in all, it was fine but I probably wouldn't stay here again. Unless it was a penthouse suite in the tower."

0,"I thought about changing my older review, but I thought I'd leave it I hopes that my frustration with them is a temporary thing.\nMonday I left work a little early to make sure I get to this shop before closing.  I had double checked the hours here on yelp.  I arrived to find that they are closed on Monday's.\nToday, Tuesday, I drove over after work to finally get that haircut.\nThis time I arrived at 5:47 to see a handwritten note on the door saying that they are closing today at 5:45.\nI'm not sure if I've got the patience to try again. Maybe I'll give V's at Norterra a shot."
1,"I love this place and have eaten here at least a dozen times. (I live kind of far away to admit that). The menu is comprehensive as is the wine list. You can have amazing really gourmet Thai fare, or you can go for authentic simple peasant dishes. Both amazing in their own right; simple and delicious or complex. I actually like their salads and curries. They'll put together anything you want if you don't see exactly what you want on the menu. They are very accommodating. I almost always order their seafood and it really just perfect. There is a newer section to the restaurant that I am not as fond of for seating. It pays to make a reservation and specify you want a quiet corner, if that is what you  are looking for. They will take good care of you. This place is a class act but the atmosphere is not what you might expect for this caliber of food. But really, it's part of the quirky nature of Vegas."
0,Mikes use to be the place to go about 15 years ago but has gone down a lot over the years.\n\nDecent price and the food is ok but not what it use to be.\n\nThe service was very slow and it was fairly empty went there on a Thursday night around 9pm so no reason to take so long to serve.\n\nWe got 2 sub and they were lukewarm and the bread wasn't really toasted.\n\nWish they would go back to what they use to serve
1,"Hey!!  I'm waving my at you!  Yes, I'm up on the stage at the House of Blues Gospel Brunch, and I've got my big blue hat in my hand, and my Sunday print dress on, and I'm waving at my pals to come on up and join me!!! Which they eventually do, after slurping down the last of their Bloody Mary's.  The music just enters your brain and gets your spirit hopping, and before you know it you're up on your feet on stage, even if it isn't your birthday or anniversary, it can be one of the best times of your life.\nThe buffet is a generous and overwhelming helping of Southern food, so there are a lot of Southern favorites like ham, peel and eat shrimp, corn bread, and even grits, as well as coconut cake and all the regular breakfast staples.  The meal is served at long tables, like a dining hall, then the band comes on and renders their soulful ballads in the best of gospel style.  There is an invitation for interaction with the band, the servers constantly bring drinks around, and if you are able to recover from tehenight before, go on up stage and sing halleluliah like you mean it!"
1,"Hands down the coolest thing we did on our most recent Vegas trip! Absolutely worth getting a rental car and making a special trip. \n\nThe tour itself takes an hour and winds through the junkyard trail of long lost neon Vegas signs. Our docent was full of information about old Vegas, how the signs got to the museum, the history of the hotels they came from, the current status of the hotel, etc. \n\nThe price is more than reasonable and goes toward a good cause. You can buy the Neon Museum/Mob Museum combo ticket too if you're into that (we did that but I was less than impressed with the Mob Museum). \n\nA must do! Highly recommended!"
1,"This is one of the better airports in my opinion.  (Hey a huge leap better than LAX which I usually have to fly out of!)\n\nMcCarran has free WiFi,  it's clean, easy to navigate, lots of shops/boutiques and places to eat.  There's a great selection of places to drink and slot machines everywhere. \n\nThe last time I flew in to McCarran, my friend's flight was delayed from Dallas (who I was supposed to meet there) so I ended up waiting nearly four hours for her inside the airport and the wait was extremely pleasant.\n\nI didn't take a taxi out of here, so I can't comment on that, I took a shuttle and that is pretty fast too\n\nMy departure from McCarran was pleasant too.  The TSA line at McCarran is extremely fast to get through (compared to LAX) and I like watching their funny videos they have (Elvis going through the TSA line and such like).  The TSA agents are friendly enough.\n\n."
0,"Traditional North Italian fare served pleasantly but without imagination. This place won't wow, nor probably let you down. It is Red Sauce Central. \n\nVeneto Trattoria has been here for ages and has a solid following of the older crowd and those who can't get into Houston's across the car park."
0,This place is the definition of slimy! The employees try to upsell you on everything.  I bought a pair of shoes there for 80 dollars and found them at Ross the next day for 15.  It is super overpriced and whatever you do DON'T let them talk you into a VIP membership!! It is not a one time fee and when I caught them on it she didn't even sound shocked or apologetic.  All they did for me was refund my money on the extra membership charge and said they would speak to the mangers later.  Umm I guess you lost a customer.
0,"A mozzarella bar where you can't get mozzarella (or bread or italian lunchmeat--until dinner.  Poor, confused service."

0,Apparently English speakers and employees at this restaurant are not welcomed as per the owner who told employees that they could only speak to themselves in French.  The employee quit in disgust and I will stop going here as long as that policy is in place.
0,"Rip Off's!!! They did an oil change for me, inspected my brakes and told be they were fine, but I needed a new water pump for $800!!! LOL \nHad it, all my hoses, all my belts, new thermostat and radiator flush for $400!!\nSomewhere Else!!!\n\nThen when I returned the next week because my brakes had been squeaking since they inspected them the week before, they had the balls to tell me it was because I needed new brakes.\n\nWhen I told them their Mac has just said my brakes were fine last week, they said I must have driven them hard!! IN A WEEK????\n\n\nTook my truck down the street to Midas on St Rose...they told me I still had 50% left on my pads!!!\nDo yourself a favor....DONT DO BUSINESS with these cheese balls!!!!!"
1,"It's big time trouble that I live across the street from Lorenzo's... The food is completely amazing!  I've gone with several people from New York who claim this is as good as pizza back home.  It's always hot, fresh and excellent - I have never had a bad experience with the food.  Definitely isn't too hot for your waistline but it's all relative. \n\nI'm big on customer service, which is why they are only getting 4 stars from me.  Most of the time, I'm greeted by the owners saying a robust hello but am served by un-energetic staff. There isn't a lot of urgency or attentiveness to customers.  The food makes up for it but I would love to see this change made.  \n\nGlad to have Lorenzo's as a neighborhood staple!"
1,"My family loves this place!  From having your pictures printed to getting eye glasses, this place is top notch!  We always feel confident buying stuff here as if we have any kind of problem with it or don't like, we can return it without a hassle.  The Executive membership is the best as you can more than pay for your membership on the rebates."
1,"Love the trail: the variety, the views, how clean and up kept the park is! It's my favorite place to hike!"
0,"Service was good, food was not. I ordered a chicken burger with half and half fries and rings. The fries did look like they were made from fresh cut potatoes, but the fries were greasy, limp, overcooked, and almost cold. Rings were also close to cold, overcooked, thin and flimsy, greasy, and they honestly looked like the nastiest rings I have ever seen. \nThe chicken burger was a pressed meat patty, which I wasn't expecting. If I hadn't been there with friends on my lunch break, I would have sent it back and gone somewhere else. As I said before, service was good, so I left a fair tip, but the food was severely lacking."
0,Food wasn't good. I'm korean. And I know korean food. I saw all these good reviews... But i think food is pretty bad.. Hopefully they'll fix it..
1,"This review is for the Oyster Bar they have.  Haven't stayed at the hotel so I know nothing about it.  But the fact that I LOVE oysters makes me come here.  Between here and Palace Station's Oyster Bar...I rather come here.  Pan roast is BOMB!  Oysters are BOMB!  Only thing I don't like is the seating.  High top tables with high chairs.  I'm 4' 11\"" and them chairs are NOT easy to get up on after a few drinks.  Haha!"
0,Made the mistake of ordering lobster at a steak house.
0,"It pains me to write a negative review - I always get the most expensive haircut here, and then always leave a big tip, and I liked them - been coming here for years. Then they switched from paper based reward system to computer (good), and they asked me for my cards to put on the computer last time I was in (good), but then none of my six \""Stars\"" made it to the online system.\n\nSp...I stopped in once, and they promised they'd check into it and call back. Nothing. I called and left a message, and was promised they'd look into it and call back. Nothing. I emailed them and waited for a reply. Nothing. Its just a shame - to treat, and lose, a customer over something so easily fixed as a free haircut (six \""rewards stars\"")."
0,"My husband and I went there last Saturday evening. We were 1 of 2 tables occupied, so we were a little nervous. Why wasn't this so called great place busy on a Saturday night?  Well, we found out. \n\nThe lone person on the floor was a nice enough person, just needs some training. She was the hostess, busser, and waitress. She spent a lot of time in the kitchen area so when we needed something it was difficult to find her. It was obvious her dinner was in the back since she came out eating several times.\n\nWe ordered the vegetable pajun only to receive the one with shrimp in it. Luckily my husband could smell the shrimp and saw them quickly since I am allergic! It took a few minutes to find our waitress since she was in the back again, but she apologized and made us another one and served it with our dinner instead of before our meal. Then we received our meal. We shared the Bimbimbap with chicken. Blah and bland. The rice was under cooked and the chicken was not seasoned and extremely dry. We added a lot of hot sauce and soy sauce to get some flavor, but it was hard to get over the \""chewey\"" texture. The pajun that we had ordered was fine. A bit under cooked and runny, but fine in taste.\n\nAfter a LONG wait for our waitress we got our check. We were quite surprised that the pajun was not comped. I didn't complain, just took mental note of another misstep in bad service. \n\nIf you want really good Bimbimbap, go to Graze on the square. That place knows what it's doing! This was not worth it."
1,Yummy BBQ. Good quality at a reasonable price.
0,"Ok, so I WAS going to give this place 4 stars, maybe even 5, but after having a great b-fast there last week I thought I would take all of my family who is in town this week, to b-fast there this Sunday. When I called to make reservations for 8 people, I was told they don't take reservations on the weekends, As if, you would need them any other time. So I kindly told the guy on the phone, well- you're loosing my business. He, of course, had no reponse. He is the same guy who wonders why at 30 hes working at a restaurant.\n\nand i seriously don't want to hear THIS local business WHINE about the bad economy making them close. I will tell them to SHUT UP  b/c they just turned down 8 people who drink a ton of alcohol and give good tips. \nI can guarantee they'll whine anyway, and then close, and then wonder what happened. Everyone will be shocked but me. It might not be this year, but trust me with that kind of customer service--people will go elsewhere."
1,"Three words, three cup chicken. So great! I love the cucumber tomato side. \n\nAll the pizzas are also delicious are reasonably priced. \n\nThe High Tea is also good, but kind of pricey"
1,Love the Blue Black Mac & Cheese and the  Bourbon Teriakye wings are delicious!! Nice atmosphere and drinks specials! Outdoor patio is heated and full bar!! This place is cool to hang with friends and meet new ones!!
0,"Worst experience I ever had at cosmo, the two bartenders Julian and Jordan were snobby and rude!! I'm not even sure if it's the fact that I'm an Asian or because I was there with my boyfriend. I saw these two bartenders, Julian and Jordan exchanging comments and obviously toward us. They even made a sarcastic comment. I asked: what type of drink do you recommend when I usually order appletini? To which Jordan suggested \""a shot of j\u00e4ger,\"" and just simply walked away?! This was truly nothing short of a disappointment from such a chic hotel. I hope the management and the customers will take notice of my review.\n\nUpdate:\nI just want to set the record straight that I wrote this review on 12/26/14, the day of my experience. I just received (12/29/14) a very nice and personal message from one of the bartender Jordan himself. It was very nice of him to explain the situation, and that's what I call \""class.\"""
0,"As a local, I have been to many sushi restaurants in the city.  Some very expensive and some more reasonable.  My advice is to skip this place and go to Sushi Kaya in Chinatown or go to Sushi Samba at the Palazzo.  \n\nWent here with a friend to catch up and get some appetizers and drinks.  The shumai (3 tiny pieces) was awful and it was ridiculously over-priced.  The lychee martinis tasted like v8 juice and tasted nothing like lychee.  The bill was close to $80 just for maybe 2 appetizers and two martinis.  Will never come back here.  To top it off, the bartenders were annoying and wouldn't leave us alone.  Eat elsewhere!  A buffet would have been a much better option had I known the prices were insane."
0,"Really not seeing the draw to this place. Visited yesterday on a recommendation from one of their staff members I met who seemed to have nothing but wonderful things to say about his employer's restaurant. Needless to say his opinion failed to meet my expectations. \n\nFirst impressions are not everything. Make no mistake, the building itself is impeccably decorated. Inside and out are both done up really well. The place was absolutely jam packed with people too. At least 150 people were crammed into the premises, all seemingly enjoying the rush of the fast paced ordering service. And it's here that I have to hand it to them. With lines nearly out the door (and it's a long way from the registers to the exit), employees handled the crowd with ease. No hiccups. No rudeness. Perfect service. At this point it's safe to say I was impressed and excited to eat!\n \nUnfortunately you just cannot rely on first impressions. The decor is a facade for what really is going on here. Only one word comes to mind when I now think of Portillo's: GIMMICK. The food here is nothing to write home about at all, or maybe it is, just not in the way you might think. The hot dogs I ordered were served in your typical Chicago style. Sesame seed bun, pickle, hot peppers, tomatoes, onions, and mustard. How could you go wrong? Right? Well they managed to... The bun was straight out of a cheap grocery brand bag. The hotdog tasted like an undercooked Bar S hotdog glazed with the dirty dollar bills Dick Portillo managed to swindle out of me. I could have easily made this at home for a fraction of the price and effort. Even the onion rings were from a low grade frozen grocery store brand. I know this because I often buy the exact same ones to eat at home, they are indistinguishable in both looks and taste. Terribly mediocre and good only for a quick frozen home meal. \n\nSome people will gawk at my review and say \""Try the Italian beef. You'll change your mind.\"" And to that I say \""My friend ordered the 'Italian' beef and cheese croissant with gravy. I took one bite and found myself only pushed further to disgust by this rip off of an establishment.\"" \n\nWhat a waste of time and money. I think it's safe to say Portillo's failed to gain a regular customer yesterday. I also think it's safe to say I won't be recommending this pace to anyone any time soon. \n\nThe only thing saving it from receiving a one star review is it's visual appeal and perfectly managed staff. So... kudos to you Dick Portillo for creating one of the largest privately owned food brands around! What a business plan you've crafted here too! Incredibly cheap ingredients and components sold at a premium... Wow... Can you say profits?! I'd love to own the place for a week. A privately owned chain with an owner who's story defines the \""American Dream\"" and basing out of a city famous for this style of food... Sounds good on paper but ,take heed, only one word can describe Portillo's: gimmick."
0,"Let me start by saying that if it was just food that I was evaluating it would have been a 4  star rating...however, I have to rate the entire experience.  My partner and I visited last evening and had a nice dinner - food was excellent, the popcorn that they serve when you first arrive is very flavorful and the wait staff was efficient.  \n\nAfter dinner however, we decided to stay to have a drink or two at the bar - this is where things went south.  They had one bartender serving the entire restaurant and she was simply overwhelmed.  It took more than 10 minutes to get a beer and once finished took at least 15 min for her to even notice that our beer and wine glasses were empty.  We wanted to order an appetizer to snack on, but simply couldn't get her attention.  For our check, we had to stop the manager and ask for our check, which he brought to us after another wait period.  Bottom line, they really need help at the bar during the peak hours - they honestly lost money we were ready to spend on more food and drinks....\n\nIf you are going to Nan and Byron's, expect good, unique food choices - but expect a long wait for drinks, unless we came on a fluke day where they were simply understaffed."
0,"Oh what a difference a year makes. One year ago I loved Penn's Thai House. The awesome Jaime W. recommended this place, and she was right in recommending them. Penn's was good, so good that I went outside of my comfort zone to try different textures and flavors that I never thought I'd try. Lunch, dinner, persuading my family to pay a bit more and give them a try, I had Penn's at 5 stars and showed my support with my feet walking in the door and spending $50 minimum on my night orders and giving 25% tips for lunch.\n\nThat was then. The love I had for Penn's has been crushed. I visited about 2 months ago hoping to rekindle the love and happy Thai food experience I missed. Instead the food made my family sick and my sister in law said never again. I would pass over Sunset on the 95 and look over at the green neon at night...And wish for the old days. \n\nThen came word of Penn's making it onto the dreaded Channel 13 Dirty Dining segment. I read the story, SNHD said Penn's hired a top food safety expert to clean them up. I found myself craving good spicy Thai...and through strange circumstances I found myself with 45 minutes to spare and I'm 3 blocks away. Off I went...would I be able to find happiness again? Had the expert done his job? This is Vegas, sometimes you gotta take a chance....\n\nThe building is the same, but the soulless lunch plate of chili mint chicken and boring egg roll and circa 1980 school cafeteria grade egg drop soup left no doubt in my mind that the Penn's I loved was gone. Tack on the extra $1 for using a debit card under $10 and service that was cold and aloof and when I walked out the door I said I was done. I believe in redemption and giving second chances. Penn's got that opportunity...and they blew it. \n\nWhen it was good, it warranted placement on my Mythical 6th Star list. Now it's just a waste of commercial space. \n\nBetter alternatives are less than 15 minutes away. You would be better off to use the Yelp app and find them. 1 Star, under protest....what a shame."
1,"Came here a few weeks ago for their happy hour (3-7pm Mon through Friday in the bar area). $5 Stoli martinis on Thursdays? Yes please. We also got an assortment of apps, all very reasonably priced from $3-7. I highly recommend the sliders, they were amazing! Calamari was good, but not mind-blowing."
0,I come here all the time and I wish I had never got out the car. The inside of this place is disgusting. Dirty. And always check your order because the last two times they forgot my tortillas and my dessert. I won't be back. And I plan on contacting corporate. Service was horrible.
1,"I was sooo in the mood for a Burger... Beef!!! This place is great, went to the Cosmopolitan with my fiance fer shopping and lunch! Came across this lil joint... The ambiance is decorated with nice graffiti-ish cow paintings. My Love ordered the Greek Burger - Lamb burger with red onions, feta cheese, and thaziki sauce.... she said it was OK, Not better than Black Hogg on Sunset Blvd! I had the Machete Burger - Beef Burger medium rare, Bacon, Fried Egg, Cheese, Barracho onions, Lettuce, Tomato, Anihiem Chili, and the Machete Aioli... As you can guess... it was deeelish! The fries on the other hand was a lil to over cooked, we got the sho string fries. I suggest the thick steak cut fries! Our waiter was very knowledgeable and friendly... Must come to again when I'm back in Vegas!"
1,"Harrah's rooms are whatever - not to shabby, not too stellar - and the same goes for the food offerings...\n\nBUT\n\nNO ONE can beat Harrah's casino, except maybe Bellagio.  But see, Harrah's an Bellagio has a completely different vibe.  I go to Bellagio when I'm in the mood for some calm gambling.  I go to Harrah's when I'm in the mood for some wacky fun while gambling.\n\nThe Party Pit is the best place ever to have a rowdy fun time while gambling.  It's the area of the casino just inside the entrance from the Strip.  It's open-air (sorta), what with the gaping entrance looking out directly across the Strip, and it plays really loud Hip Hop and Pop, adding to the general young, hip, fun-loving atmosphere.  The dealers here really know how to show a gal a good time, cracking jokes and using grandiose dealing techniques to entertain.\n\nI have this theory:  If you're in a bad mood, you just can't win.  If you're in a good mood and playing for fun, the money will just come your way.  It's like a law of nature or something.  Harrah's always puts me in a great mood, and their low table limits help extend my fun times.  I also like the party plus option sometimes, so that's a plus.\n\nIf you're in Vegas and not too serious about gambling (i.e. gambling is just for laughs), definitely hit up Harrah's and have a grand ol' time laughing and cheering with your fellow gamers and dealers.  I promise, even if you lose, you'll walk out with a smile!"
0,"bland flavorless boiled meat.... i got teriyaki pork, yes the meat was tender and perfectly cook alas it was totally tasteless i got up to ask for more sauce and she handed me what i thought was vinaigrette but it was just the most watered down teriyaki sauce ever... it was almost clear... so then i asked for the sweet and sour sauce also almost flavorless. my friend asked for the brown rice they wer e out of it but didnt tell her until they brought her food to the table. she also got the vgitarian bowl and it was frozen mixed veggies, carrots broccoli and cauliflower with rice that was it for $7.00 and she said her veggies were still cold.. the pinapple on the plate was still green and totally unripe. the coconut icecream was good the grandmoms chocolate cake was still raw inside and seemed like very under cooked brownies.. i wouldnt waste your money here.. go somewhere else..."
0,"The food was fine, but our waitress was pushy, almost rude.  She was more salesperson than waitress, pushing certain dishes by saying, \""all of my tables order this.\"" After ordering a bottle of wine, she suggested her favorite, which also happened to be nearly twice as expensive.\n\nMaybe just because it's Vegas this type of service is OK, but anywhere else, a restaurant like this wouldn't last long with such opinionated waitstaff."
1,"The food here is hands down delicious. If you're looking for something tasty to try, check out the spinach and feta pie. The baked kibbee is to die for, and the lamb sandwich is always on point. It's never over cooked or chewy. I typically order mine without the hummus but add a white garlic sauce to it. The babaghanoush is sooooo good. Pretty much anything on the menu here is wonderful and cooked perfectly and with passion. Don't skip out on the lentil soup either!"
0,"So, i dont expect much when i dine at these types of establishments and try not to make habbit out of it but when its late and you are hungry you find Fiesta Burrito.  I keep it really simple with a chicken burrito but EVERY time i order the same thing i get something different, and get upcharged for someting...Staff is pretty cool but when i get my beans on the side instead of in the burrito..$3...or the next time $.75... or during the day..free.  Quality is bad but again, i dont expect much out of these places."
0,"I used to love Ross J's, but left really dissapointed after my last meal there. I ordered the chicken katsu plate which comes with rice and potato salad. The rice was dry, hard and COLD. I considered asking to have it reheated, but with a frustrated looking line of 8+ people (plus more seated and waiting for orders to be filled) I decided against it. Yes the prices are cheap, but you get what you pay for. I think it's time for a new Hawaiian spot!"
0,"I love the Holiday Inn brand, but I'd avoid this particular hotel in the future. Nobody seems very happy to be working there. \n\nI'd gotten a bottle of water on check-in because I'm a platinum Priority Club member. I lost the cap and asked for a new bottle at the registration desk as I needed to leave to deliver a presentation. The staff member at the desk got rather huffy about it. Instead of getting one from the back room, she called another department and asked to have one delivered to the front. After 10 minutes, we gave up and had to leave. 100,000+ Priority Club points and a second bottle 17-oz. bottle of  water is apparently an unreasonable request.\n\nThe room wasn't made up the first day by 4:30 in the afternoon - we had to call to request service. The mattress was the soft, ancient kind that bounces your bedmate if you make the slightest move. \n\nI visit Mesa for this conference annually and I'll be staying elsewhere next year."
1,"I just went into this store yesterday with my girlfriend to do some shopping for a party that we were invited to and both her and I were blown away by the selection of foods and other items here in comparison to other supermarkets (especially the Safeway at 83rd Ave. and Cactus) and the Walmart (79th Ave and Peoria).  The bakery had every variety of pie and cookie you would ever want, they have a very large beer / wine / liquor selection, they carry all sorts of pre-made items like freshly baked buttermilk buscuits, and the list goes on and on.  They have a nice floral department and all kinds of prepared foods in the deli selection.  There just seems to be more stuff everywhere.  It also appears to have been renovated recently so the store is nice and clean."
0,"One step above a hole in the wall buffet place.  Food was edible.  Very bland, service was very un-attentive and my egg roll was soggy to boot.  I'll take my money elsewhere."
0,"For me the pizza is too expensive and and the flavors too exotic. For example, I tried the Pear & Gorgonzola pizza. It isn't bad, but I'm in no hurry to go back and order another. If you're in the area, I'd recommend going to Claim Jumpers instead."
1,Best chicken vegetable bowl of all the places I've tried also great friendly service.
0,"Went to this place today  to grab a beer to find the  bartender threatening to send the waitress home for not greeting someone that was  aiming to sit at the bar. I didn't find it my place to say anything to him about it because I don't like conflict but it seemed to really have embarassed and or pissed the girl off. I asked her how she was doing and she said \""I'm doing the best I can, thank you for asking\"" sweet girl even after. Hated to see her embarrassed like that so I threw her 5bucks because I felt her pain and the guy seemed like an asshole but I still gave him a tip for the sake of service."
0,"Ehhh.....it was ok. Quesadilla was ok......Carne Asada burrito my daughter had was down right aweful. Queso dip was good. I doubt I'll be back. GREAT service tho, very attentive and polite waitress."
0,Prices are STUPID. God forbid you order a Sam Adams Double Agent Seasonal beer - it's $7.00. Yes. $7 for one pint of a beer that is $8.00 for a six pack at any store. Total bullshit.
0,"My first rule of dinning is to only eat at places that are busy. I do this because I like to know that other people find it to be good enough to come back but more importantly I know the food is fresh. Put it this way, I've watched too many episodes of Kitchen Nightmares to even chance a restaurant in a great area with no one in it. With that said we didn't get past the bar at BOA. It was 6:45 on a friday night in Las Vegas and we were to only people in the restaurant. On this night we finished our drink and made our way to Joe's just down stairs."
0,Ugh. It's just not very good and the service is lacking.\n\nGo a little further to Pete's Fish & Chips. It is worth it.
1,"O, OOOO, OOOOOOHHHH MY GOSH, That is kind of how I felt when watching this awesome show, my wife and I were lucky enough to get some great special treatment and we were able to sit in the production booth and watch this show and take a backstage tour after. Now, those perks obviously added to the overall experience but without that I would say this was the most amazing show I have ever seen. First of all the theater itself was amazing and the the design of everything was simply perfection. All of the different acts hold there own level of intensity and none of them lack that O factor. From the seating we had we had a great view of the stage and how complex the entire production really is. \n\nI was shocked to learn that the music for the show is performed live, yeah you heard right that is not a recording. The music was spot on and keeps you licked into the show for sure. \n\nWe have a friend that we have met through Verve and she is one of the Amazing performers in the show and after we were lucky enough to be shown around back stage by her and learn a little more about the complete awesomeness and the struggles that some of these performers go through to become a part of this awesome production. This was an extremely awesome way to spend an evening and I would go back and do it again if I ever had the chance.\n\nI would recommend this show to anyone coming into Vegas, Not that I need to, It looked like everyone in Vegas had already decided to go considering the theater was packed."
1,People of all ages would appreciate this Musical. Right after the Show. I could see Big Amazing Smile from Kids. Telling their Mom and Pop how they Love to see Simba...\n\nIt Touches Heart of the Audience. This Musical has a Meaning.....Good for Kids and Adults that has kids at Heart....\n\nKudos to the CAST !!!
1,"The main things that get me in the door at Big 5 is shoes and Spenco shoe inserts. Big 5 runs some great deals on shoes from time to time, and while I'm in there I'll pick up a few odds and ends. On some of their camping stuff they have a pretty hefty markup so knowing your prices and comparison shopping can keep you from overspending. But all in all they do carry some things REI doesn't, and they've made my supply list for sporting goods and Burning Man needs."
1,"Someone told me about this place and their all you can eat spaghetti. They also mentioned that they have great meatballs...so I had to check it out myself. \nThe first thing that bothered me was the noise level...it's like all the conversations going on in this place remained within the walls. However, the staff was very friendly and the service was good. \nI had the Artichoke, Shrimp & Crab Dip which was good, but I wish it had more chucks of crab. I obviously tried their spaghetti with meatballs which I thought was good, but not  the best I've had. The sauce was a bit to watery for me and the meatballs just didn't have that \""wow\"" factor, but it was good (just not the best). I had also ordered a customize Calzone and that was without a doubt fabulous! The size and flavor were definitely in the \""wow\"" factor. This helped to push the rating to a 4 star plus the service."
1,"The Botanical Gardens are a pretty cool place to check out if you're in the Bellagio. If you want a break form the hectic tables and stuffy smoke infused air, come to the Gardens. They change the theme from time to time. Currently it's an Asian-Chinese New Year inspired theme. It's the perfect place to come and just people watch or hang out or take a break from gambling."
1,"Always had good, fresh food and friendly service. Their chicken tacos are some of the best I have ever had, and I will always be a customer because one time I ordered but had lost my debit card, and they still fed me and just told  me to come back the next day and pay. There are not many resteraunts or businesses that will do that anymore, and I was impressed.\n\nThey also make a pretty good torta and the carne asada is pretty good. \n\nCheap, fast, and yummy...."
0,"I have been to this restaurant twice, HATED the food.  The last time I went I had a great bartender. I can't remember her name, but she was good. Too bad the food couldn't live up to the service. Very poor quality menu! Great weekend drink specials and service, but food SUCKS!!"
0,"i don't see the big whoop with this bar. it always seems to draw a big crowd on friday & saturday nites. it's pretty busy all the time. they don't offer food accept for bags of chips. they may have a frozen thing they pop in the microwave. it's  mixed crowd of all ages. the tvs are ok. nothing special. they do have a happy hour. it's ok. i guess if you're in the mood to hang with alot of people, it would be a good place. they do have karaoke and live music at times. i would only go here if i'm trying to stick really close to hom."
0,"This bar is worth checking out and then never going again. It's a hole-in-the-wall and has free popcorn, but after that, loses its luster. Walk up State St. for a slightly more classy joint like Paul's Club after you see this dark and crowded underground bar."
0,"Why do so many people in Pittsburgh love this place? The other day someone asked me... where's your favourite Vietnamese food? I told them that I didn't know which was my favourite, but I could tell you which was my least favourite: Tram's. \n\nI don't even care about the decor or seating etc. Usually the best Vietnamese comes from fairly sketchy looking joints. \n\nI had their \""Special\"" noodle bowl which is their version of Bun thit nuong. It looked a mess. The spring rolls were cut up brutally and then everything was tossed in. Usually when you order this at other place, it doesn't come \""pre-mixed.\"" Honestly, it looked like someone had already starting eating this. I thought to myself... \""Okay they have a different presentation style.\"" \n\nBut as I ate, I was even more disappointed. They hardly put any fresh vegetables in it, and the vermicelli is overcooked. The spring rolls were completely soggy. \n\nI don't think their menu is limited though, it seemed fairly typical. I don't know, maybe their Pho is better, but I'm already too disappointed to come back.\n\nAfter reading other people's reviews and trying other Vietnamese places around the city and then having Vietnamese food in Toronto(at an average place), I'm throughly convinced that people in this city have no idea what Vietnamese food is supposed to taste like.\n\nOh and one last thing... do you actually believe that their food is vegetarian? I guess the joke's on you."
1,"Okay, so last week I went here with my Dad and his girlfriend Suzy. The owner, Antonio is very personable and was very kind to us as we entered. I've also noticed that each of the four times I've been here, he was also there. Excellent to have the owner/operator around to keep things top shape.\n\nSat us in a corner this time, wallpaper is a bit old, building is a bit dingy, and yes the dining area and lounge have a bit of traffic, but it's fine with me. Adds to the experience, gives the restaurant character, etc. \n\nFood was great, I went with the wild boar special. Alongside were two Delmonico steaks covered in sauteed mushrooms and Gorgonzola cheese. Delicious! Wild boar was done well, also tasted like a exotic pot roast, but no gamy taste to speak of.  Got three side-salads that were decent, but yea, were covered in dressing. Vegetables on a dish were steamed and lightly buttered.  Fresh bread was good. \n\nAnother great thing about Mallorca is the portion size. An eating-persons restaurant; you will be lucky to finish half of the portion of most dishes, so expect to have some leftovers or the opportunity (at $6) to get a second plate to share. \n\nAlso, Sopa de ajo for any garlic lovers."
0,"My friend and I decided to try out TGI Fridays for a beer during the baseball game to get a bigger bang for our buck. For what we would pay for a small hot dog and 20 oz beer, we could get a great meal, larger beers, and great service, right?! Wrong. \n\nThe restaurant was not very crowded for a game night, yet we were denied a table overlooking the stadium. Twice. The manager asked us to visit the hostess stand to get a table, but they informed us there was a wait. NO ONE WAS IN LINE FOR THE RESTAURANT! \n\nI had to get our own menus from the bar, after playing \""let's avoid making eye contact, and maybe she will go away.\"" After we ordered, three sets of people were sat in the tables we were waiting for, and their meals came out before our order! \n\nOur waiter ended up offering us a free beer for the late arrival of our food, and ended up comping our entire check, but that will be my last visit \""Front Row.\"" \n\nI'd rather pay $10 for a beer and $8 for a processed hot dog than to get snobbed by anyone in the service industry. All I wanted was a good time after a work day from hell, and to enjoy a Diamondbacks game ..."
1,"Was a big fan of the lincoln park location in chicago, so to find the same menu, at similar prices with al fresco dining overlooking the bellagio fountains was a nice treat.\n\nThe service was super fast, and the warm brie was superb."
1,"The BBQ is great at this place. Pulled pork, burnt ends, ribs...etc. It is awesome. The sides though are definitely lacking. My mashed potatoes and gravy and macaroni and cheese looked like they came from a frozen dinner. BUT....the BBQ makes it worth it...just go with the fries to be safe for your side. Also, if its available, sit next to the shark tank. Its really cool."
1,"I dig how small this place is. I felt super comfortable sitting on the floor and digging through the bargain bins. Everything is priced well. They had a decent selection for being a small shop, and when I asked about a specific artist, they recommended I follow them on Facebook, where they would absolutely list any of his albums they got it. I'll certainly be back on a regular basis."
0,"GOOD:\n* Good deal for three nights - $139\n* Hotels were clean and decent\n* Offers a GREEN offer - you get $10 voucher if you don't have cleaning service\n\nBAD:\n* The free $10 slot deal really sucks because of their system... we lost the $10 by putting the card in and didn't get to play. We went to complain and they said too bad.\n* No pets allowed\n* Old school TV\n* Channels were not what they said they were\n* The gym sucks... you pay $10-20 to get entry and it really isn't worth it. I got in for free but if I had to pay, I'd demand my money back. It was TINY.\n* You need to pay for Wifi!\n\nOverall... I'd stay here again BECAUSE of the deal, but I would probably just come here to sleep and go on the strip to workout and play the casinos."
1,"Went there during my visit to Edinburgh based on yelp reviews.\nLuckily our hotel was quite cloes by this place so we went there for lunch.\nInterior was pretty modern and tidy. Liked it.\nWe ordered Aubergine+mashed potato dish and something Kefta with almond sauce (Sorry, not sure about the names we ordered).\nTo be honest, I was a bit worried about this place even though the reviews were good because I am not a vegiterian.\nBut as soon as I and my boyfriend tasted dishes, we regreted that we worried. It was heavenly good, not to mention very hearthy...!!\nI could feel that dishes were very well and healthily prepared. No doubt.\n\nIn Edinburgh, I strongly recommend here along with Thedogs I visited on my first day. \n\nJust go there. You won't regret :)"
0,Honestly the worst customer service I have ever had. They got my wedding date wrong so they were going to give me back my altered dress three days before my wedding! I really wish there were more bridal stores because this one is just awful.
0,This place is okay. The waiter was horrible and barely checked on us. The food was also not too good. It was very bland and didn't have a lot of taste to it. I will not be coming back.
1,"I absolutely LOVE Audra! \n\nI have been a devoted client of hers for probably well over a year or so? I've had a wonderful experience EVERY time! She has a beautiful, clean studio and is such a lovely person. She has a very comforting personality and is so accommodating and pleasant. Her waxes are as painless as they come - and she is quick, very convenient!  Her prices are quite reasonable and she has always been flexible with scheduling and rescheduling when necessary.\n\nI usually go for wax appointments, but I have had her facial treatment as well, and it was outstanding! Very relaxing and my skin looked fabulous after!\n\nIf you go elsewhere - you're missing out!!!"
1,"Wow! We arrived a little late for our reservation but we were greeted and seated immediately! The hostess an manager were very friendly and made great small talk with us as we made it to our table (very comforting when dining in such a nice restaurant!). \n\nWe were seated at a great table that felt like we were in the middle of all the action and not banished to a dark corner. The waiter arrived quickly with a wine list and our menus. We ordered drinks and they arrived right away along with an AMAZING  bread basket!! We had tons of questions about the menu and our waiter was very knowledgeable of each item and made our decisions very easy! \n\nWe started with the French Onion Soup and Steakhouse Wedge Salad! Yummy!!! We decided to split the items and the waiter brought us each a portion of the salad so no messy sharing! It was very nice! \n\nWe decided to order the Porterhouse Steak for two and it was delicious! The steak literally melted in my mouth! (not exaggerating!) For our sides we had asparagus, Mac and cheese, and truffle gnocchi!! \n\nWe finished it off with creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e! We were too stuffed to eat the Key Lime pie there but had to order it to go so we could enjoy it later! (all the other reviews were right!!! I'm from Florida and it gave my hometown Key Lime pie a run for its money!)\n\nOverall it was a great experience and an extremely satisfying meal! The best date night so far!!"
1,"I had read about this locally-owned business in the Ahwatukee-Foothills News and then noticed a coupon in the mail.  We were having a party in a few weeks and the carpets were a mess, not to mention the three areas that had been snagged/ripped from when our Puggle was a puppy.  It was perfect timing to give a new company a try.\n\nI called and scheduled an appointment for carpet cleaning and repair for the three spots.  The woman on the phone was kind and helpful.  She answered all of my questions and scheduled my appointment.\n\nWhen the man arrived to clean the carpets, he was very friendly, knowledgeable, and easy-going. He even went into my attic to get the extra carpet for the repairs!  He worked quickly and even put up plastic guards to protect the corners of the furniture and walls so that the hose didn't leave any marks from being dragged through the house.  And he had little booties on his feet (OK, more like big booties) so that his shoes didn't get the floors dirty.\n\nTwo things to be aware of.  1 - This time, my carpets did take a little longer to try because I didn't go with the company that has the fast-drying chemicals.  This is the organic stuff, no short cuts here, but a much better feeling than having chemicals under your feet!  2 - No credit cards accepted.  Check or cash.  No biggie, as long as you have your checkbook on had.\n\nOverall, I was very impressed with the quality of service and quality of work that I received from Barefoot Organic.  Plus, all for a very reasonable price!  I will be sure to use them again and highly recommend them for your carpet cleaning or repair needs."
0,"I was satisfied coming here when it was 50% locals. For around $17, this buffet was good. BUT, for full price of a 25% discount for most locals, it's not worth it at all. \n\nThe front entrance of the buffet reminds me of a corral where cattle are herded into. There's electronic pay machines one one side, and a small booth for the human counterparts. The problem here is when you want to get a discount, which you can get $1 off with their member card, you have to line up in the human one, and that one is LONG at times.\n\nService is pretty lazy, and the layout of the buffet seating is pretty odd in places. Booths can feel broken at times, and chairs are uncomfortable. Drinks are drinks, but the alcohol service is pay by drink (others like Studio B are complimentary). \n\nThis buffet is large, but most of it is made up of \""make your own\"" stations that suck. Make your own tacos (with prepackages/easy to cut up stuff), and whatnot litter this place. \n\nThe food is basically O.K. Not amazing, but not disgusting by any means. Salad and soups are standard fare, asian sections sit around for a while (cheap sushi sits out, and certain steamed items get hard and gooy after a while). Crab legs (though I hate them) were rather thin, but people still flock to them. What I find surprising is that the previously frozen fried food was great--fried perfectly, and the deserts were pretty good (aside from the random one that looks great, but tastes horrid and is hard to eat). \n\nIf you're a visitor, go somewhere else.\nIf you're a local without their \""platinum\"" membership, go somewhere else.\nIf you have that platinum membership card, think about going."
1,I had a side of chicken shwarma it was amazing with their garlic sauce I did not have any of the vegetables or hummus
0,"I would not return without strong coaxing. The food was nothing special. We ordered one of the skillets. I can't remember the name but it was the only one with feta cheese. Maybe my expectations were off but, when I have ordered skillets at other restaurants, the ingredients were integrated. At The Griddle, each item (scrambled eggs, potatoes, chicken and feta cheese) appeared to be cooked, placed on the iron skillet separately and then served. Additionally, the chicken was dry. The waitress also did not charge us the correct price for egg whites but, my friend did not want to address this as it was only a $1 over what it should have been.\n\nI ordered the French toast as I heard The Griddle on Eastern was known for their French toast. The portion was a good size and they tasted fine. Not wonderful and not bad but, they would not bring me back to this restaurant over another place."
1,"Had a friend recommend this restaurant when she found out I'd been eating vegetarian lately. Am I ever glad she did! The food was cheap, absolutely delicious and completely veggie. It's a cafeteria-style serving situation, and there were lots of seats, mostly full.\n\nThe spanakopita was great, the cannelloni was also very good and they have ginger beer. The second night I went in, there was a live band playing enjoyable music at a good volume.\n\nI really can't recommend this place highly enough!"
1,"I really like the food here, good customer service and clean.  Enjoyable experience, every time."
0,Very bad. The salad bar used to be one of their strengths. They've cut back on the number of items offered. I tried one of the few items on the menu that listed calories (BBQ chicken with one side). Sauce was cloyingly sweet. The side I chose was creamy mashed cauliflower. It was little better than baby food. The plating was absurd as well: these two items alone on a plate - little islands of yuck on a sea of porcelain. Will not return to this or any other Ruby Tuesday.
0,"I bought a coupon on living social and I had the hardest time just obtaining an order conformation. After a month (literally 30 days) of calling, sending over 5 emails, and placing orders on the company's website, no response from the bakery. How hard is it just to send an email responding to a cupcake order? I ended up going to another bakery for my niece's birthday cupcakes. Good luck to anyone who purchased a coupon."
1,"My friend had a Groupon ready to expire and was awesome enough to share it with me.  I've lived here all my life and always thought of Vincent's as a place our grandparents would all hang out at.  The decor looks like it, but that's ok.  It's a French restaurant and definitely not geared toward yup's.  The food and service were still fantastic.\nWe started with the foie gras and duck tamales.  Duck tamales at a French restaurant seemed a little strange on the menu; so we were intrigued to order.  They tasted like duck tamales.  They were good.  The foie gras was awesome.  We were also brought the most delicious croissants I have ever had.\nFor our main courses, I had the lamb and my friend had the wild boar.  My lamb was fantastic and came with yummy potatoes and green beans.  The wild boar was good.  If you are curious what while boar tastes like; it tastes like pork.  Lamb is one of my favorite meats and this was definitely one of my favorite times eating lamb.  \nWe finished off with desserts.  I ordered the profiteroles and my friend had a grand marnier souffle.  You really only need to order one dessert per four people.  They are large.  The profiteroles were tasty and very rich.  I couldn't come close to finishing them.  The souffle was actually two souffles.  I've never had a souffle before so can not really say if it was a good souffle or not.  It tasted like eggs.  My friend said they are supposed to.  The chef brought us out complimentary flour less chocolate cake.  That was delicious.  It would have been amazing with some vanilla ice cream on top.\nThe food was amazing and I will definitely be back when in the mood for some French cuisine or even just for some wine and desserts.  I would recommend as a great place to take your mom for her birthday too."
0,"I give this place 2 stars for the entertainment.\nThe band was great!  Food was just not very good.  The food server was not attentive at all. This is the second time we have been here and we won't be back.  Sorry Toby,\nmaybe you should actually try the food before you put your name on it!"
1,"I have to agree with My T. on this one, the ambiance is unique for Vegas.  I have to also agree with Thao T., it is very bright and contemporary.  And last but not least, I have to agree with Duy L, the owner (DW) is a very amicable guy.  You can tell as soon as you see him that he is the owner and takes pride in his food.  (BTW the above shout outs are all long time friends of mine, I just wanted them to feel cool)\n\nOkay moving on, the place itself is very feel good.  Bright lights, very fun, friendly atmosphere.  The food is very good in my opinion, we had the brunch.  I had the breakfast sandwich.  Packed with flavor and not too greasy, which is always a good thing.  I tried my friends Chicken and waffles, but there is too much competition out there for this to be the best.  And the curry was excellent also, I could have devoured my friends plate.\n\nI would come here again, it stands out in Vegas."
0,"I met a friend there yesterday for breakfast.  I really wanted to like this place because everyone was so friendly.  Yes there is quite a wait but my friend and I were catching up so it went by quickly.  From the looks of the menu, I wanted to order everything.  Being part Filipina from Hawaii, it was refreshing to see the food had that same ethnic vibe.  I ordered the corned beef hash, eggs, & garlic fried rice.  I really didn't like the texture of the corned beef hash.  It was too processed, and like another Yelper noted, reminded me of dog food.  The garlic rice was good, like my mom's.  I also didn't care for the pancakes.  They tasted very strongly of baking powder.  I can't remember what my son ordered but he ate it all without complaints.  My friend, also from Hawaii,  ordered the Loco Moco and ate all of hers.  She ordered a short stack of the red velvet pancakes.  I tried them and again, the taste of baking powder was overpowering.  The cream cheese syrup was good.  My son ate the rest and liked them.\n  \nI am not completely turned off by the place and want to give them another try.  Perhaps the pancakes were just bad that day?  I want to try other items on the menu.  I think it's great there are Hawaiian-style breakfast items on the menu even though the owner is not from Hawaii.  Oh yeah, we were told that the chili on the menu is Zippy's chili!!!\n\nI will be back here and hope to upgrade this review."
0,Low rating due to customer service issues not furniture. Sales person lied about what was in stock rather being honest about back ordered sofa. Stated it was in AZ ready for delivery then a week later after the sale I find out it was actually on back order. Instantly lost me because of lies. Still love my sofa and love seats. Quality is good. When the couch was ready they have me the wrong one. So the low rating was mainly due to poor processes and customer service rather than the furniture. This was the second purchase at Ashley. The first time was smoother with no issues.
0,"Unless you are flying in and out of here don't rent a car from Dollar! The car rental took a long time although the customer service was great. It is a nightmare trying to return the car unless you are leaving on a plane. There are carts for your luggage, but the only help you will get is from volunteers. Avoid this place unless you are flying, in which case it is fine."
1,"The food is fantastic, but the portions are disappointing.  You're paying for the quality of the ingredients at America's Taco Shop.  The food is not that expensive, but you're going to need to order more than you think you need to if you want leave feeling full.  Just be ready to spend a lot more than you thought you would at this dive.\n\nI had the carne asada burrito and pastor taco.  I love that there's guacamole in the burrito, and the caramelized onions are great.  The burrito is fantastic, but a little smaller than I'd like for $6.  There is an XL option for $1 more.  Maybe I should try that next time.  The taco was also really good, but also small for $3.  All sides, including chips and salsa, are going to cost you extra.\n\nMy taste buds were certainly satisfied.  The food's quality is superior to any of the upscale fast food burrito chains (it may even be better than many full service restaurants), but you'll get a lot more for your money at those other places.  Your options for everything is steak, pork, or veggie.  I probably should have asked this while I was there;  But what does America's Taco Shop have against chicken?\n\nThe restaurant is small.  It does feel a lot like a little cantina somewhere in Mexico. There's very little room inside.  The patio seems like an okay spot, but I wouldn't want to be inside or out on a hot summer day.  The parking situation is really bad.  The lot is tiny.  Your best bet is to skip the lot and just find room on the neighborhood streets."
1,*THE* best Thai iced tea I've ever had.
1,"OMG!   First time going but I think I will quickly become a regular.  The shrimp PoBoy was on hit!!!   I thought I was back in New Orleans.  Delicious, seasoned right, bread fresh and hot.  Nice and friendly staff.  I had to get the cook's name...Six.  He really knows how to cook.  YUMMO."
0,"Not great, mostly due to the service.  The upstairs space is mostly a bar, apparently has karaoke in the evenings.  I went for lunch, and sat downstairs which was under the balcony, and shady, but kind of dark and claustrophobic.  The greeter was a teenage kid who basically grunted at me when I walked in, \""upstairs or down?\""  The table was not wiped, and had crusty dried food spots on it.  The server was surly, no smile, no thank you.  Kind of afraid of the menu that was kind of all over the map, so I got the burger with cheese and bacon.  My iced tea took 10 mins to come, and the burger another 15 mins.  It was plopped down in front of me with no words, and the server walked away, so I had to get up to ask for condiments.  The burger itself came with shredded lettuce and tomato already on it, so you couldn't really disassemble it, but I managed to scrape off the lettuce, which I didn't want.  Other than that, not a bad burger, thick and handmade, with a good toasted bun.  They had a radio station playing over speakers which was either poorly tuned or not local, as it was very staticky and annoying.  As good burgers aren't hard to find in Old Town, I won't be back."
0,Knowledgeable. Plays on your intelligence - you need to have good idea what your items are worth or what you are willing to consider a fair deal . Must ask direct question to get answer as he answers question with question.
0,"What kind of a place is this supposed to be? A hangout for dumbbells?\n\nThere's nothing in this place. Is this a joke? There are slot machines in the middle of the floor and a counter of some kind off on one wall. They sell.... cigarettes?..... pies?.... Can I get a pie, please? Do they sell small bags of chips? Chewing gum? Bic lighters? How about a free toothpick? Can I have a book of matches?\n\nSo much empty floor space. As I recall, there were only about 6 slot machines in the whole joint? Oooooh, funnnnn!! C'mon, Dotty, jazz up your dump. Gimmee a burger and fries. Gimmee a hot dog with extra mustard. Gimmee! This company seems to do well since Dotty has a chain of these slot machine garages all over Vegas.\n\nNot much here for me. I can have more fun stomping on ketchup packets."
0,"Eating Review of Rokerij\n\nI want to like this place. Its a great setup and well done environment. The setting is stylish and dark so you want to sink into a booth and get down to eating some food.\n\nUnfortunately my first experience has left an impression that is less than stellar. My girlfriend and I had been wanting to try it out a few times. We got a booth by the fireplace and settled in for a nice meal.\n\nThe specials are written up in chalk on the wall as you walk in which is a great method for displaying specials. We are both vegetarians that will eat fish and were excited by the plethora of fish dish choices on the specials board. This tends to say that a place can do fish.\n\nOur server was nice enough but when we asked for some recommendations he stared at us blankly and grabbed the menu like he hadnt eaten there in a while. This is a huge pet peeve for me. If a place is gonna charge $20 or more for an entree the staff better be trained on the dishes and be ready to give some recommendations. Show some passion and knowledge and sell me the good stuff.\n\nWe ordered the White Bean Bruschetta to start. It was edible but lacking in flavor, maybe some salt wouldnt have hurt, but something more than just beans and toast please.\n\nNext was the soup of the day which had a lot of smoke flavor going on, not impressed.\n\nFinally we went with the sesame crusted fish with a melon salsa. This dish started off a disaster and just got worse. First of all the server brings it over holding it with a towel. As We shift plates around to make room he starts yelping a bit in pain. Not a great sign. Once he gets it set down we move to dig in but my lovely date brushes her arm on the plate and comes away with a pretty solid burn.\n\nThis is just plain stupid. There is no need for a plate to be 200 degrees. Cook the food and then bring it out. Dont cook it at my table on the plate!\n\nUnfortunately the fish was not edible, at all. The melon salsa was horrid. We sent it back and still got charged.\n\nRokerij I want to love you. There are a lot of folks on Yelp that love you but I have to say that for food you have not impressed me."
1,"It's ok. Nice rooms, but a club on the 30 something floor going all night??? I'd stay again. Food was good at the deli at 2am. Nice location off the strip."
1,"Went here with a coworker for their lunch special. I got Lo Mein, it was good, a bit oil but good. They have really redone the inside and many people were coming for takeout. The food was hot and fresh and the lunch specials were priced right! I really liked the tang dressing on the salad. I would come back!"
0,"What has happened to The Riv?! This place has gone downhill and it makes me sad! \n\nWe decided to look for something to eat in the food court. It was not the shortest walk from the parking garage to the food court area. If you are walking in from the street (las vegas blvd) then there are doors right on the sidewalk to enter which puts you right into the food court.\n\nThis place was filthy. It looks like a yard sale walking through the casino. Suddenly you see a row of pinball machines, then you see a Coinstar machine among various other odd things. It is like they just randomly cluster things around the place.\n\nI had to stop into the bathroom and the toilet area was actually OK but the sinks are another story. There was paper thrown about, and drink cups everywhere.\n\nWhen I saw the food court I was excited to see the options. I do know it is a food court and wasn't expecting anything spectacularly amazing, just something that tasted yummy! We noticed a Cheese steak place,  Mediterranean, , Subway, Etc. I had been wanting for sometime to try \""Angelina's Pizza\"" and was delighted to see they had what they called a \""Angelina's Pizza Express\"". The cashier was very friendly.  They sell pizza by the slice which sits under a heat lamp until ordered. I recommend buying a whole pie if there is more then one of you since leftover pizza rocks. \nWe decided on a large pepperoni. It was 18 inches and cost $29.58 for the pizza and 2 fountain drinks. We waited in the food court seating area until the pizza was done baking. The tables and floor were filthy. The cashier brought us our pizza and again was very friendly. The pizza was pure grease. There was barely any sauce on it. I thought it was a waste of money personally.  \n\nWith other options on the strip the Riv is going to have to step up its game!"
1,Great company.  Did a great job on my install.  Excellent customer service
1,"While I only went there during lunch, this Japanese restaurant was always consistently very good. The fish is always of excellent quality and the service is great. Well worth the price."
1,"Before this past Saturday, I have never waited outside of Mickies and have considered myself extremely fortunate.  During my last trip, our group had to wait for about 10 minutes.  Our table was crammed up to the radiator next to the main window.  There were people bumping into us everywhere.  I LOVE MICKIES!\n\nOur service has been prompt in the past.  During this trips \""swamped\"" time, our service was not slacked at all.  Our waitress (who my wife and I have had several times before) was legitimately happy to see us and kept our drinks filled the entire time despite the hectic population.\n\nFor breakfast (though it was lunch time, I can not live without breakfast) the Scrambler is king.  Do it any way you want.  You can not lose at Mickies.  As long as this cornerstone of Madison is here, I will be a happy patron."
1,"Wow! This place is amazing! I was visiting Phoenix, and drove to Chandler just to check this place out. I'm glad I did! \n\nI went here specially for their jerky. There were three flavors: Turkey, Cajun, and Regular. I asked Ralph which flavor does he recommend, and he gave me huge samples to try! They were all delicious, but I chose the Turkey and the Regular flavors. The turkey jerky was so tender and very lean. The regular jerky was smoky, just the way I like it! \n\nI wanted to try their steaks, but since I live in California, I obviously couldn't buy any to bring back home! Next time Von Hanson's, I will be prepared for you and bring ice packs and a cooler! No, I'm not joking."
1,Does anyone know where the Groomers Kimmie & Byron might  have moved onto?
1,"Watched a show at the Mirage and afterwards came here to eat. They had excellent sliders, fries, and buffalo wings. I would have ate more if I hadn't drank so much! The grade of meat they use here is excellent and service was very good. Would recommend you try this place out if you want a good tasting hamburger. They even have wagyu burgers!"
1,"What a cool little cafe, with a DJ playing early in the morning, delicious berry corn muffins, and good coffee. A little loud for my taste at that hour, but quite a popular little joint, and lots of regulars. Cool artwork on the walls. I was staying nearby for a few days, and for me, this was definitely the best part of this neighborhood."
0,"I want to give minimum possible star! Horrible food, worst customer service. While eating the dinner buffet, I have been asked twice. I mean guy couldn't see me eating the food. Tiniest Bowl I have ever seen at this place. You can't even take out the curry with a spoon out of that bowls. Please  don't waste your money at this place."
0,"This place was one of my favor place in Vegas! But today I found a hair inside my order! I was like: mmm...just a hair, seems normal! After I took a closer look at it, and ask my friends about that! We found out that is not the kind of hair on top of our head, that makes me wanna puke right away! Now I'm still feel sick of that!!!!!"
0,"I've been to this location a couple of times and both experience was pretty good.  The serving of the food was pretty big which is great because it fit the price. The service has always been quite stellar, our server was always pretty great. The food, I would have to say is very good EVERY TIME.  Always up to a high standard.  \n\nToday, however, was a whole 'nother experience. We came in with a party of 8 (technically we asked for a table for 7, plus a high chair for my baby nephew) and we asked if their happy hour was still going on.  We were informed that it was and it was a self-serve area by the bar.  So we just put two tables together and no biggie.  When we walked in the waitress, Olivia, assisted in putting together the tables.  Keep in mind, we only came in here because Cheesecake Factory had a long wait time and we wanted some desserts ONLY. Also, we came in a whole HOUR before the place closed.\n\nNevertheless, we sat down and we became interested in their happy hour menu which was advertised, not only in their website,  but also all over their tables.  So we decided to add some appetizers to our order.  After ordering, we were informed that the Happy Hour prices are no longer valid, despite the fact that it's clearly stated on ALL their tables and we got a happy hour menu.  She said they just changed the policy that day.  And that the advertised Happy Hour is only valid during the REGULAR Football Season.  Is she stupid?  The REGULAR season is not over until the SUPER BOWL!!!! Uhm, OKAY.  So we placed our orders still and I went to check with the hostess, she got the manager and I spoke to her and she informed us that she will honor the happy hour prices.  \n\nOnce we got our order, my sister accidentally spilled a bit of blue cheese in her coffee.  When I asked the waitress for a new cup, she ignored me.  When I asked for an extra bread for my nephew, who wanted more bread, she looked at me with an incredulous expression and paused to say, \""uhm, yeah...okay.\""  She comes back to refill my coffee (without any spoons distributed to us, AT ALL) and proceeded to refill my sister's drink SEEING that there's white stuff floating all over it.  This whole time, she would go back forth to the bar and whisper with the bartender and they would roll their eyes.  \n\nAs she poured that coffee, I was astounded at her stupidity and her laziness.  I was just staring at her hoping she would notice and it would click that she should get a new cup.  NOTHING! She avoided eye contact with me and had this stupid smirk on her face like she's mocking us.  WHAT THE HELL!? I understand that she may be having a bad day, but proper customer service should still be practiced to keep professionalism intact.  Unfortunately, she had neither professionalism nor proper customer service etiquette.  I once again asked for the Manager and she could not even do anything but serve us the remainder of our order, in which time, my sister walked out because she couldn't take it anymore.  I have seen a lot of bad customer service in my time, but this has got to be the worst I have ever seen.  She should not be a waitress if she does not like having to wait on others.  It's absurd! It's insulting! And most importantly, it's unacceptable!! This will definitely not be the end of it.  We're great tippers as people who has worked previously in the service industry.  We know the value of a good service and we pay good money when we receive it.  But that service that we received did not even warrant a single penny.  They're lucky my brother in law is still very generous and still left a tip.  I cannot  believe that experience.  \n\nFor a company that is under Landry's Inc., who claim that they are the leader in Dining and Hospitality, this kind of service is truly unacceptable.  It's abhorrent and just plain idiocy to have those kinds of servers employed at such a facility.  I will not go back to this location EVER.  Lastly, the hostess, provided better customer service and professionalism that the manager and the two servers we came across during this visit.  WHAT A HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE! They totally ruined my sister's 17 years anniversary with her husband!"
1,"I was just here again on Sat 10-15.  Good times as usual besides my friend getting kicked out for being \""too drunk\"" within 20 minutes of being there.  Met some nice people at the outdoor area once again and stayed until 4am shooting the breeze with them.  The music was the usual top 40s electro mashup, 120 bpms+.   The dance floor was packed as usual, nice and diverse crowd.  Parts of the night was a bit of a blur, but I woke up with sore legs, which means I had a good time on the dance floor!"
0,"This place is very overrated. I went for brunch and my burger was dry, overcooked, just blah. I wanted to send it back but did not see the waiter again and the place was empty. To make it worst I had to eat it with the tap water that was served when we got there because when I asked another waiter for a drink he replied: \""I'll let your waiter know\"". He didn't. I even had walk up to the maitre d to ask for the check! Stay away from this place."
0,"What can I say? The food is pretty ordinary, you could find way better Indian/Pakistani food in Montreal. Every item on their menu is either oily or too spicy although to their credit they have a lot of variety of vegetable and meat dishes (as well as entrees, fruits, desserts, breads and rice). Basically I would go to a proper restaurant and order a dish that I like than go to Maharaja for a buffet. Probably the only thing going for them is that they are the only Indian Buffet in downtown Montreal."
0,"On a recent trip to the Valley of the Sun (or Hell is what it should be called during this time of year), I thought I would get my Greek food fix by visiting Jay's.  Bragging about their *authentic* Greek gyros, I thought, surely they would compare to our great Greek restaurants in the pacific northwest serving delicious food that will make me want to cry.  Sadly, I wanted to cry but not in the way I had hoped.\n\nTheir servings are huge and you do get plenty for what you pay for.  Their gyros are gigantic and they don't skimp on the lamb or chicken.  But the flavor was a bit off.  It just wasn't up to par with other gyros I've had and it didn't come with lettuce!  I ordered their Greek salad w/chicken kabob and although the chicken was charbroiled just right, the flavor was again a bit off.  Also, I wasn't a fan of their tzatziki sauce.  It was a bit runny and tasteless for me.\n\nWhat really turned me off about this place was that we ate lunch here at 3p and Jay's closes at 4p.  Why did the owner and family begin to start cleaning the tables and giving us dirty looks at 3:30 making us feel like it was time to leave?  With their mediocre salad and inhospitality, I humphed my way out of the A/C and into the outside furnace."
1,"Ok, it's a J in the B.  Stupid to write a review.  But I rarely eat fast food and almost NEVER J in the B.  \n\nDuring a recent adventure in S Phoenix, I was in need of some lunch and this was the only place around.  Well, this and a Whattaburger, so my choices were pretty limited.\n\nWow.  This place is CLEAN.  And the woman who took my order was both FRIENDLY and COMPETENT.  My order came out QUICKLY and was CORRECT.\n\nAll things I usually never experience at fast food joints, or at least all at once.  5 stars."
0,"Great show, horribly run theater. We bought tickets in advance, thinking we would save time. Not so. We waited in one line for 25 min to get our tickets and then they told us to get in line a minimum of 45 min before the show started to get in. I thought this was odd since we already had our tickets. It was because they make everyone line up in one line so they can take your picture in front of a green screen so they can try to sell you some campy photo on the way out. This added an HOUR to our wait. After that line you get in the actual line to get in the theater... And wait there for 40 minutes.\n\nJust a horribly run theater with inept staff. They started late, corralled you in like cattle and told you where to sit in a \""first come first served\"" ticketing scheme, we were all sent to the back of the the room even though we were at the front of the line. They were still trying to find seats for people after the show started and it was very distracting. They seated people in the isles in stack chairs and folding chairs.\n\nThe \""Ultimate Variety Show\"" was great and well worth the ticket price!\n\nThe V Theater was a frustrating experience that nearly ruined a great show. Several people including us almost left because of the wait.\n\nManagement of the V Theater: DON'T BE GREEDY! People don't need to spend an additional 45 minutes in line just so you could take their picture and try to sell it them later. Have some respect for your patrons' time and for the theater experience itself. Shame on you."
1,"I had a hankering for pasta and Lavo hit the spot. After parking in the Palazzo and trekking it to the Venetian, did I realize the Lavo is in the Palazzo.  My suggestion is park in the Palazzo and look for the signs showing guest registration and you will run into Lavo. They do accept reservations so call ahead especially on busy nights. \n\nAfter three weeks of low carbing, pasta was the only thing on my mind. With a plethora of Italian restaurants off the strip, out of all the reviews, Lavo seemed to fit.  I chose to sit out on the patio, despite being 10pm it was still a cool 93F outside. With EDM playing in the background and the glimmering lights from the strip, it gives Lavo a very trendy feel.  \n\nThey start you off with complimentary garlic bread wrapped in foil to keep it absolutely straight out of the oven warm. Paired with a red dipping sauce, it melted in my mouth. What was a portion intended for two people did not hold a chance once I began to devour the little bites of heaven. \n\nOn to the entree. Spaghetti carbonara had my name or should I say my stomach written all over it.  The plate looks deceptively small but once you dig in to the mound of pasta, you know you are gonna walk away satisfied with the portion. The spaghetti carbonara did not disappoint. It was rich in flavor and solid meal all around. It's not the best I have had but considering the location and the ambiance, Lavo definitely deserves 5 stars.  \n\nI finished the meal with a white chocolate breading pudding. I wasn't expecting much when I ordered it but wow, what a surprise. It wasn't overpowering or too sweet. It had all the warm elements of a bread pudding with a slight bitter but sweet white chocolate taste. I had had gone into carb heaven a almost went comatose. \n\nIf you are looking for a trendy Italian Las Vegas hot spot, Lavo will not disappoint."
0,"New neighborhood Italian joint that sadly didn't meet expectations. It has only been open for a week, so hopefully these issues will be resolved in time.\n\nThe price point is high and the food quality was rather low. I loved the complementary family-style salad, but that was about it. Much of the food had odd, unexpected flavors including the entre\u00e9s, dipping oil for bread -- even the tea. All of these items had several individual flavors which just didn't come together and one flavor that made you think, \""what IS that?\""\n\nThe staff was very friendly, but green. I couldn't get drink refills and dropping off/picking up food was a bit clumsy. But, again, they were nice and trying hard which means a lot.\n\nI want this place to succeed and, as noted above, let's hope they improve with experience. With so many Italian options available with better quality at a lower price, they will have to improve."
0,"We came in on a Sunday morning and expected a wait, especially for a party of 9.  But after waiting 45 minutes, I checked our status and host told me there are only 2 tables that could fit us and they were just sitting down.  I told him to separate us to 6/3 or 5/4 and he nodded.  After 2 hours of waiting, we finally sit down with no menus and no water.  Waited another 10 minutes before a waitress came by.  We ordered and 1/2 our party had to run and asked for their food to go, only to find it our order hasn't even been started yet.  They cancel and leave.  The rest of us get our food and it was a huge disappointment.  I had steak and eggs, both were over cooked and dry.  Steak was such bad quality.  Fruit was old.  Everyone's meals were not spectacular and not worth the wait at all.  We wasted nearly 3 hours of our lives on this meal.  UGH."
0,"The food was decent, but one gets the feeling of eating at the dorm cafeteria in college. The people were nice though. I just wish they had more of a difference between lunch and dinner. Almost everything was the same.\nThe desserts were pretty but most of them failed to make an impression."
0,My husband and I ate here dec 18 2010. And we ordered chow fun and some kind of noodle soup. Chow fun was $16 and the soup was $18. The service was bad. Not very friendly servers and also the manager staring on us while we were eating. I don't know why he was doing that. Anyway my husband said it was a waste of money paying $45 worth of food we paid. The food was not really good. And will not eat here again. We do not recommend this restaurant at all.
0,"We went back for a second time just to see a band that we were friends with...same story, different night.  It's amazing to see all of the bad reviews on here and that NOTHING is being done to actually improve the experience.  I see the replies from \""Management\"", but it is just a really poorly run business.  The service was incredibly slow, food is awful, cold and overpriced and drinks are bad.  How can this happen...twice?  I've tried to be a fan of this place (the one in Vegas is OUTSTANDING!) but this one is just missing the mark in every aspect of food service."
1,"The Orleans is a great hotel by itself, now add the value and its amazing! I mean $100 for 3 nights? sign me up... Yes it is kinda far from the Strip but no biggie if you have a car, the drive is quick and easy. The rooms are larger then standard and very comfy, great room service as well, yummy food.\nCheap and good food options like the Prime Rib Loft, for example."
1,"Wow. I really, really love Lazy Jane's. The scones really are THAT good and there is truly nothing better than waving that big Bakery Express Wand to get them. And coffee snobs may think it's trashy, but I am so glad they have hazelnut coffee.\n\nThe key to Lazy Jane's is to go very early on the weekend or really, any time during the week - it's small! Last week, I brought in Lazy Jane's scones for my office and I think I'm now everyone's favorite co-worker. I never noticed a bad attitude from the staff or fellow patrons. I wish I had kids so they could play in the adorable kid nook upstairs with toys, books and comfy couches! \n\nIf you do insist on a late morning meal with a party larger than 2 on the weekend but can't handle the line, here are my tips to deal with it: check out the board, decide what you want, tell the designated \""order-er\"" of your party, go grab a seat, and be happy."
1,This place is incredible! Truly a hidden gem!!! You definitely can't judge a book by its cover... although the exterior may not be easy on the eyes the inside of this place you can tell is very well maintained and clean. I been here a few times and must say no complaints the staff is amazing and super friendly! I've tried many dishes and have yet to be disappointed! Chicken enchiladas with rice and beans are my go to but the super chicken sandwich w/French fries is also one of my top favs!  I would HIGHLY recommend this place to everyone and their mothers!
0,"My husband and I decided to go to Church's and Popeye's and bring both home and have a taste test. Both had pretty good food, and I really like that I could get fried okra at Church's, but I still have to only give it two stars based on the experience. \n\nChurch's was dirty, the building looked ancient, and it seemed like nothing was upgraded since it opened. There were flies, the door was messed up, and although I didn't notice my husband pointed out that the air conditioning was flawed. That was not the worst problem though. Now before anyone calls me a racist, I have no problem with people who can claim that English is their second language. I do have a problem with someone who can barely speak English, and the English they do speak is impossible to understand. She seemed like a perfectly nice person, but she should be working as a food preparer instead of taking orders. \n\nI feel the lack of customer service and the ambiance really took away from the experience, and it was not surprising that while Popeye's was doing a rather large lunch business, Church's was empty except for one other customer."
1,"pleasantly surprised by the variety of costume jewelry here, right now they have a lot of interesting summer sun hats in the $20 range.  A fun browse with friends when you happen to be downtown or going by on the light rail.  The lady in line in front of me in line yesterday was agonizing over what to buy because there were so many things she knew she would never find back home...in Chicago!  Take that, Chicago."
0,"I've been to Carne Vino several times now. I don't know why, well, yes, I do, it's for the bread sticks. They're to die for. If you want to have a drink and don't mind paying more than almost anywhere else on Earth, then by all means stop in and enjoy. I rationalize that it's just the price of having those crack-like bread sticks.\n\nThat's really where my love for this place ends though. Just a word about price. Here's an example of how insane the prices are. I went in for lunch last week (and bread sticks) and the house special was $40 for  two drinks and a tuna sandwich. If you just wanted the tuna sandwich it was $19, and I believe the burger was $20. I'll admit that I've had $120 burgers in Europe, so it's not the most expensive, but for what you get (I sat for 30 minutes in an empty bar and the bartender never returned to take my order) it's just not worth it.\n\nFirst time in, we all had steaks. The quality of the meat was definitely far behind other steakhouses like the Palm over at Caesar's, SW Steakhouse, Delmonico's, Del Frisco's and the others we've tried here. Overly fatty and tough. It's always possible that you just go on a bad night, so I never write a place off because of one so-so experience.\n\nSo, we went again and my wife and I had the carpaccio (it was okay, just nothing to write home about) and I don't even remember the entrees. I just remember that both of us kept marveling throughout the meal at the prices vs. the quality, particularly in light of what you get for lower prices at the other restaurants in Vegas, even in the same hotel (Palazzo has equal and better food at Woo (now closed), Cut (amazingly good) and Table 10 to name just a few.\n\nSave yourself some money and visit one of those other places where you'll get better food for less money, or for about the same money (at Cut) just better food and service."
0,"I have always had a good time at Top Shelf, but last nights visit proved different.  Are server was preoccupied with a baby at the bar then taking care of his customers.  I ate 2/3 of my dinner without anything to drink because he didn't check on us.  My food was cold and my tacos were so greasy that the grease was pouring out the bottom and the shells fell apart. While still finishing my undelightful  dinner, the server finally asked if we needed anything else or wanted desert.  I asked for water and my husband asked for more tea.  It took over 5 minutes to get the drinks.  My husbands tea glass was completely packed with ice and 2/3 full with tea, there was so much ice that he could not even mix a sweet n low in it. I will try one more time, but think I may have to love on to somewhere else."
1,"This place gets the four stars because of the patio.  What a GORGEOUS patio to sit at in November.\n\nFood is pretty good... average I guess, but I'm not much of a breakfast person.  I had the Bacado omelette (bacon and avocado) and it wasn't bad, but nothing special.  Now... the potatoes that come with it... I LOVED those.  Love the seasoning.\n\nService was not bad... server kinda ditzy paired with my friend's dry humor... recipe for humiliation, but otherwise good."
0,First experience: Dropped off 8 shirts and 3 pairs of pants last Friday morning for dry cleaning with medium starch. Picked up clothes Monday after work and upon examination of shirts (looking for burn marks) the top button fell off - unknown cause as shirt is fairly new. I checked my pants and the main button on one pair was broken in half. No other matters noted. The staff seemed friendly but I'm going to try someone else.
1,"This is a HUGE international supermarket, and lucky for me it's a 10 minute drive away!  A large part of the supermarket is dedicated to Asian items, but the store certainly does not neglect the Hispanic, Indian, and Middle Eastern foodstuffs.  The two huge draws for me are the produce selection (their chile peppers are a steal) and their vast array of meats.  It's one of the few places that I can go for pork belly.  \n\nThere's even a food court area with Korean food and a bakery.  I haven't tried them yet, so I can't speak to the quality.  But it's really cool that they are there!  The one drawback -- there is definitely a strong odor that comes from the seafood area.  I believe it's from their shellfish, because their larger cuts of fish don't seem to have that odor.\n\nOverall, a great place to go if you're looking to venture out!"
0,"Had been going there for a while and ended up with bland versions of the same style.  But since it seemed safe, I took my daughter with me for my son's wedding for a trim and style.  She was done before me and left crying.  I was reduced to a solitary wow when I saw the source of her anguish - the \""stylist\"" had chopped off a random chunk of her naturally curly hair in the back for who knows why.  It took forever to grow out.  The same day my stylist double booked me and was racing back and forth between me and another woman.  Just dumb.  I never went back and suggest you avoid this place like a pair of cheap shoes."

1,"Gumby is not my middle name. Nor is \""rock hard abs.\"" But increased flexibility and strength rank high among my fitness goals, so I'm glad I discovered Iron Butterfly Pilates as I work toward those goals.\n\nI'm a student of the mat, and pretty much was a novice when I attended my first (free) class at IBP. Admittedly, I was nervous about exposing my inability to touch my toes without bending my knees and my shaky-arm push-ups. Fair reader: IBP is a no-intimidation zone. There are classes to suit all levels, the instructors give clear instruction on form and where to focus your effort--providing demos when needed--and discreetly help you into proper position so you can rock the right muscles and maximize your overall workout. Better yet, they are attentive to your abilities and limitations, and enable you to modify exercises to your level, Gumby or otherwise--all with the same great results.\n\nWhile I've only attended mat classes so far, IBP has other offerings such as yoga, physioball and reformer classes, as well as private instruction. So I know I can mix it up with these, and the occasional special class options have been a perk (e.g. the CrossFit/mat class, which was a humbling yet much-needed push).\n\nThe studio is beautiful, the instructors are friendly and nurturing, and the prices are reasonable. So while I still bend my knees during a stretch, it's not as much as before. And I do feel stronger. Gumby would be proud."
1,"The food was great and the beer selection was outstanding.  However it is a bit pricy for the area.   The wait staff is still in a break-in process, but doing well.  Admittedly, it was hard to get past the beer, any place with Dogfish Head 90 minute IPA on tap is awesome in my book.  That being said, and since I was asked....\n- The Black and Blue French Fries, absolutely AWESOME!\n- \""Cheeseburger on a Pizza?\"" - killer pizza, the onions and cheese really set it off."
1,"Really great place to get your nails done! This was my first time and it was really fun to try out a new place. Fun, as well, to have guys doing your nails. They did an excellent job and I plan on going back there again. \nThey have parking behind their building and they give you a parking validation thing, they said to come in once you park and they give you something to put in your car. Much better than the street metered parking."

So after the club we go back to our hotel room which is at the MGM. We stop at the front desk to ask if anything was still open at 4 in da monin. They said yes if u walk to our farmers market (which is kinda far and even farther if u been on your feet all day & all nite in some hills) we have a pizza spot & a McDonalds that's 24hours. I so hat3 McD's so we said we would walk back there for the pizza. \n\nSo needless to say we get there and both lines are long but McDONT'S is shorter. We both are tired azz h3ll & just want something in our system so we can soak up the liquor & go to bed. So we stand in line for I don't know how long for that nasty azz food get up to the freakin counter to hear we outta food all we have is 5 fishes and 2 chicken. EXCUSE ME !! \n\n1st off ... what the h3ll language r u speakin ? I guess 5 fishes is supposed to be fillet of fish & the 2 chicken with no \""s\"" is supposed to be some kind of chicken sandwich. So 2nd'ly...I get upset bcuz y u did not announce that to everyone standing in line. Were practically standing there 4 no freakin reason. So my girl orders the darn 2 chicken. 3rd...who in the h3ll is managing this place ? How r u gonna b open 24hrs and DON'T have any food ? Just freakin turn the lights off at 10pm y don't u !!!\n\nSo now were on the long walk back to the room. We get there kick our shoes off get comfy open up our 2 chicken and WOW... bread...mayo...chicken. WHERE THE H3LL IS MY LETTUCE ? WHERE IS MY TOMATOES ? So now I am forced to eat this dry azz sandwich no fries to go with it ( thats the only thing i eat at McDont's is there addictive french fries) and some left over water from the club cuz oh yes...these fools didnt have any beverages either.\n\nCan some 1 help me understand how a fast food chain that claim they sold over a billion hamburgers and so forth run out of food...IN VEGAS...@ THE MGM GRAND who has bookoo money.\n\nSo the next nite U know we had to do it all over again but this time we went straight to the pizza spot.

DO NOT GO 2 MCDONT'S !!!!! U will b HIGHLY upset !\n\n0.0 stars...They deserve 100 rocks thrown @ em"
1,It was good. Love the all you can eat Shrimp. The menus are quite expensive. But I didn't mind spending more
1,This place is Amazing the owners are great the food is Amazing cold beer and all family oriented a matter of fact I'm watching football and eatting with one of the owners and his daughter doesn't get better than that
1,"Cool little gallery with lots of Southwest art.  Admission is free, and although I'm usually not a big fan of Southwestern style art, I enjoyed looking at the various paintings, sculptures, and pottery.  They also have an interesting selection of guns from the Old West."
1,"At the time I got my 3rd seaweed salad,  I was going to give this place 5 stars. However, my eyes can always handle more than my stomach. I took off a star because they don't allow you to waste good, meaning that you HAVE TO EAT EVERYTHING you order. So for those that are greedy, please heed my warnings and DO NOT OVER ORDER. Otherwise I feel like the all you can eat option is much better than ordering individual rolls, unless you're watching your figure. If you're craving sushi in Vegas, come here to get your fill."
0,"You feel like you're in a used car lot.  The staff is WAY too aggressive with sales, my last Dental office treated patients more like a real Doctor,  not just a customer to see how much money they can get out of every visit."
0,"I wouldn't even know where to start to describe how bad the Vet Dr. Hershey and her staff are. She charged me for a tissue biopsy when I clearly stated I did not want one and I did NOT want it sent out. There is no recourse with the Vet board in regards to charge disputes. She literally threw a bottle of medicine at her receptionist. She told me a spleen removal carried no risks and that it was more simple than a spay surgery. When my dog was bleeding out during this \"" no risk surgery\"" she had her tech run out and ask ME \""what I wanted her to do\""? She told me the surgery would cure her anemia. My dog had bleeding tumor lesions all over her ear and head and she wouldn't address it. Her serious 3 different bacterial MRSA infections were also ignored by this Vet. She says she is holistic integrative but provided NOTHING holistic except to recommend Yunnan Baio. A mobile Vet had to come to my house and at least put an elastic bandage on my dogs head to stop the bleeding from her ear. Dr. Hershey's only goal is $$$ money, money, money! And there is HUGE mis-communications between her and her staff. They don't answer the phone or return emails or phone calls. You're risking your dogs health & safety if you take them here. Plan to spend your whole day waiting in this office. I was a legitimate client of hers and know what I'm talking about! Trust what you read people!"
0,"Over priced candy, I don't get it. \nThe girls were very nice and helpful."
0,"Walked in and everyone was busy.  We patiently waited, un-acknowledged, for 5 minutes.  Then three other people walked in and were seen before us."
1,"Never a bad experience here.  Everything we've had has been good, including the service.  Good drink selection, tasty salads, flavorful pizza (and I'm usually not a thin-crust fan, coming from Chicago), and friendly service.  It's always seemed busy in there, which I guess is a good thing which shows that others think highly of them as well, but we've never had to wait long to be seated.  We'll be back again soon."
1,"Functional Performance Center is an amazing place.  There is a reason their clients range from professional athletes to senior citizens... they know what they are doing.  I was physically unable to walk after my injury, and despite my doctors prognosis, I am able to run today.  Physical Therapy is NOT as easy as taking a pill.  You get out of it what you put into it.  That includes giving constant feedback to your therapist as you continue your therapy, so they can monitor your progress.  I was asked every session about my pains/progress and my tasks were always adjusted accordingly.  Without this team I would be considered handicapped today.  I have recommended the FPC to my friends, and they were also very satisfied with this business.  I will continue to recommend them to anyone of any age looking for physical therapy.  Their staff is professional, friendly, and talented.  Best place in the Valley for PT, hands down."
1,"(11/15 / 14 ) Our first time here. After reading reviews on Yelp I felt we needed to give it a try. I ordered a Thai ice tea, crispy spring rolls and a bowl of Tom kha to start. For my entr\u00e9e I ordered Pad pra khing I believe. I'm really looking forward to my meal. \nThe restaurant itself is quite modern in design.  There is a little bit of art on the walls along with a few nice LED televisions. It could've been plucked out of downtown Bangkok.  I expected to see scooters racing along the street outside. Our server was Annie. She was very attentive and kept our table clear of empty plates and our drinks perpetually filled.\nWhat I noticed about all of the dishes was that they were very flavorful. My wife had ordered fried tofu and chicken satay. The tofu was encapsulated in a crispy batter that reminded me of the batter on fish and chips. The tofu itself was moist and absorbed the peanut sauce well. The chicken satay was moist and tender. It complimented it's sauces nicely as well. The spring rolls were light and crunchy. The Tom kha was flavorful and spicy just the way I like it.\nMy wife had beef with broccoli with wide noodles. I think it was P2 on the menu. She said it was good. My Pad pra khing was a great surprise!  It was flavorful with a nice underlying heat. Whether the heat was from chili oil or other spices I don't know but it was a pleasure to consume and savor the dish.\nFor dessert I had mango and sweet rice. It was very good too. We will be coming back again."
1,"This is a must dine experience while in Scottsdale.  The table side Guacamole is the best my family has ever eaten.  My kids devoured the crispy pork & cola lime glaze.  The pork shoulder that my son and I shared was heavenly.  My daughter found the Mahi Mahi Tacos fantastic.  The best fish tacos that she has ever eaten.  The Pumpkin bread pudding and fried bananas for desert were exceptional.  \n\nI have been to the mission several times for business, and I have never been disappointed."
1,"You may ask yourself...but aren't all gas stations alike? Before visiting the Trop Stop I would have said yes! Well, kind of. Typically when I fill up, I go to Smith's...its just cheaper because I buy a lot of groceries there...however, when I am looking to get my car washed, I go to Trop Stop. They have your traditional drive through carwash, but what you don't see is that if you buy the traditional car wash (around $7) you will get a hand wash and hand dry...once you pull up to the car wash, 1-2 attendants will come out and scrub your car down really really well. After you go through the wash, they will do a very good hand dry. They will do this even if you get the cheapest wash offered. All you need to do is tip the attendants. Seriously, you can get a hand car wash for anywhere between $10-15 depending on your tip. I've not seen anything like this before. However, after I stopped by my first time (have been back a few times since) I always see Limo's there. This is where many of the limo's in town get their wash, I can imagine its because of the price and quality. Additionally, you can get a hand wash pretty much anytime of the day. I've gotten one as late as 11pm (after parking under a tree all day). This is definitely a gem in the town full of car wash joints...."
0,I stop here periodically when I need something I forgot somewhere else or couldn't find.  I find their prices to be high compared to other chains unless you happen to hit a sale for the item you want.\n\nThe store always seems a bit cluttered and even messy.  There is often stock in plastic boxes on the floor waiting to be shelved.  It's just not a pleasant place.
1,"LOVE THE CEVICHE!!! Haven't had too much else but the tamarind margaritas and ceviche where GREAT! IT\""S A MA AND PA type restaurant so stop your whining about the ambiance, it has character. The only reason I gave it 4 stars was the size of my margarita....it was small:( If your in the area I'd say its worth stopping in before it gets too hot:)"
0,"If you live near fresh water (San Francisco, Seattle) don't eat fish here. Everything - EVERYTHING is frozen. Sand dab, no, - scallops - no, prawns eh, no- even frying it didn't help. just don't eat fish in AZ. \nVeggies are good \nWait staff is good\nMojito was GREAT - not a mix"
0,"I was looking for something quick & cheap for lunch today. I saw a sign for Little Caeser's & stopped inside. I got a large hot & ready pepperoni pizza with an order of crazy bread & dipping sauce for only $8. The pizza wasn't bad, I've definitely had worse. The crazy bread was awesome. I'd come here again for lunch if I was in a hurry & didn't want to spend much."
1,"i completely agree with misti. \n\ni was reminded last night how crowded it can get. i watch movies during the weekdays just to avoid crowds, but i couldn't wait to watch battle:LA last night... \n\ni waited in line 10 minutes to purchase tickets and another 10 minutes to get goodies. red rock casino is definitely a hot spot for families and for parents to drop their kids off at. i don't mind the waiting and i think it's mostly because i get a lot of bang for my buck. it's a newer, nice, always clean, and convenient theater."

1,"I am a total sucker for quaint bungalow style homes.  (I used to own one, a Sears Bungalow, 1920.)  So this adorable bar/lounge had me as soon as I walked onto the wraparound porch and into the front door.  I could smell the character.  This is a wonderful venue for a date, or, in my case, for a small group of friends to gather.  It has ambiance and then some!\n\nYou know that friend of yours who has the great cocktail parties?  That is what it feels like here when the bartender asks for your order.  No positioning to get to him, no yelling your order to him.  He's right there...all for you.\n\nWow.  I am getting nostalgic here, so let me close with these couple of important details:  1) The wine selection was small but the wines were good, and 2) the cheese/cracker/olive food pairings were quite good.\n\nI left feeling that I had just had a wonderful experience.  Interestingly, there is a bar/lounge in Raleigh, North Carolina that I still remember fondly, years later, because it gave me that same feeling.\n\nI cannot wait for the opportunity to return."
0,"Don't let the 3.5 stars fool you. This place doesn't even deserve 1 star. If I could-like most recent reviewers- I would've given this place 0 stars. \n\nToday, I went here with my family under the impression that they would have decent food- no high expectations or anything. But I was terribly wrong. The food wasn't decent, good, or even edible. \n\nWe were the only people there so we should've turned around and left but unfortunately we didn't. Hence, we had the unsavory \""pleasure\"" of tasting: \n\n1) rancid kimchi- sign #2 that this place is bad. I understand that kimchi has a peculiar smell but I know for sure that it wasn't supposed to taste like... THAT! As a korean, I am offended that the kitchen staff had the audacity to send that out. I can only imagine how grotesque the kimchi jigae must be... \n\n2) Galbi tang- don't order this. Just don't. Soup had absolutely no flavor and the beef was so tough that I couldn't even bite through it. I added a spicy sauce in hopes of salvaging it but my rescue mission failed. This is the first time got sauce couldn't save my taste buds. \n\nThere were other dishes my family ordered and didn't enjoy but I forgot the dishes' names. They pretended they liked it out of pity. Apparently the owner of the place is a friend of my grandmother...  \n\nAnyways, the dishes here will assault your taste buds. Save your senses and money. Over priced, disgusting food that isn't even refundable. I still can't get over the fact that they don't do refunds despite their poor culinary execution. (Only wanted the Galbi tang taken off our bill because that was the worst of all the other dishes we ordered)"
1,"I've been coming to El Burrito since I was in Middle School and it's still one of my favorite homegrown Mexican restaurants in Las Vegas.\n\nI've never really had a bad experience or bad food at this place because I pretty much stick to three things on the menu because each of those items are so good that I just never decided to branch out and try anything else.\n\nThe complimentary chips and salsa are always an awesome start to the meal. I usually follow that up with the Noodle Soup. It's pretty salty, but it'll warm you up on a cool night and it tastes great.\n\nI usually get one of three entree plates every time I go, which comes with the aforementioned soup.\n\n1) Two Chicken Burritos w/ Red Sauce\n2) Two Tamales\n3) Carne Asada\n\nEach of the items comes with the typical fixings, rice and beans and whatnot. Each of the items are equally tasty, and if you get the two burrito plate you will DEFINITELY have leftovers!\n\nI usually cap the meal off with the sopapillas, which are cinnamon-sugar covered pieces of dough that are absolutely delicious. \n\n:) I highly recommend this place, as a loyal customer for most of my life."
1,"Went with a small group and most of us ordered the Kobe burger. The consensus was that it was one of the best burgers in town. The garlic fries were tasty, but a little too salty for me. The Czech Pilsner was great and the service was fine."
1,"Writing to support a cute local business.  The restaurant is nothing to shake a stick at.  It still has circa 1983 glass block low wall dividers with tables that I'm sure have seen better days.  But you really are coming for the food.  And boy is there food a plenty.  The prices are dirt dirt cheap.  A veggie combo (4 different scoops of veggies/lentils/hummus etc) set on fluffy injera (with more injera on the side) is a whopping seven dollars.  Go for broke and order the large combination which comes with three meat dishes. It'll be $13.99  At this rate you can afford to have chai teat (hot or cold) and dessert.  Now I didn't try the dessert, I'm informed however it is baklava.  I will be back soon.  This is the type of place where you come to sit with a friend and talk.  The service is languid (i.e. not fast) but then again, they aren't going to hustle you out either.  It looks like they must have a hoppin' night life, with it's raised stage and what appears to be a screen broadcasting Ethiopian news.   (Oh and it still looks like the old Bacchanal, so it's like Greek restaurant meets Ethiopian teenager bedroom with crooked posters on the wall)  Overall though, it's a nice treat to be able to get away from the hot outdoors, break some spongy bread and not have to drive all the way to Tempe for some ethnic food that is a little less run of the mill than our usual taco joint."
1,"This is a wonderful brewery and local haunt when I don't want to cook.\n\nDuring the week there is a different food truck setup after 6 pm I believe.\n\nOk, Ill be honest, I am not really much of a beer drinker. ( I am more of a boat drinks type of guy) I can always fine a beer that I like to drink. \n\nOh yea and the really great thing this place is DOG friendly! Dexter can walk around and meet everyone there.\n\nJust and update...\nAll dogs on the inside of the building must have their leashes on."
1,"I have heard so many things about the Free House Pub and I thought...hmmm, it is about time I tried it.  And?  No regrets!\n\nI ordered their prime rib sandwich with harvati cheese.  This is honestly the BEST beef sandwich I have had in Madison.  (Technically they are in Middleton, but this  sandwich made up for the distance.)  The harvati cheese provided a nice flavor pop to the sandwich.  The bread was also well chosen.  It was on a soft roll, not too chewy.  My big complaint?  The au jus.  It was SO salty.  It was pretty much inedible.  Luckily, the sandwich did not need the extra moisture.  \n\nI upgraded for $1.50 to the garlic parmesan fries.  They were delicious!  The fries were crisp, hot and nicely seasoned.  They came covered with fresh parmesan flakes.  Absolutely delicious.  The aioli that came with the fries was good.  Not great.  It was creamy and a little sweet.  The fries stood alone but it would have been nice to have something with a more savory flavor.\n\nI paired my lunch with a beer from Ale Asylum Hefeweizen.  The beer and cocktail menu was pretty expansive.  I wish I had tried a house cocktail rather than the beer.  It was just ok.  \n\nI definitely plan on going back soon.  We ate on the patio, which is gorgeous and nicely covered.  Whether you want something shady or sunny, you can find it."
1,"Very good greasy-spoon Mexican place.  My husband and I both had margaritas, and they were great- not too sweet, nice amount of salt.  Make sure you look at all of the options- we ordered \""fresh\"" which uses fresh lime juice.  They have tons of tequila choices.  Nachos we shared were good, and the small order was more than enough for two of us.\n\nMy husband had the mixed fajitas, and enjoyed them.  Portion was huge, and we brought about half of it home. I had the pozole and Alex taco.  Both were flavorful.  Pozole had a nice amount of spice.  \n\nWe'll return."
1,"What a surprise.  First time renting with Enterprise and we were very impressed with every step in the process.  We were picked up at our hotel as pre-arranged at 9:30 by the Enterprise driver, Tony, from Chicago.  He was so pleasant with lots of tips on what to see and do, a great ambassador for Enterprise.  We were driving our car within 10 minutes of being dropped off and were pleased to see it was a nice clean car.  We really liked their policy of walking around the vehicle with us to review the marks on the car.  They use a card and if the scratches etc are within the circle on this card their policy is these marks don't qualify as damage .  It was reasurring to have the employee do this ahead of time and know what is considered wear and tear and what is a problem.   Our usual experience with other rent a car companies is that the onis is on us to point out all the marks to them that aren't listed on the contract.  We drove the car to San Diego and dropped it off at the airport.  Again, pleasantly surprised with our experience.  The staff were quick, reviewing the car as soon as we pulled in.  They were as professional in San Diego as in Las Vegas.  The shuttle to the airport was fast with another friendly helpful driver.  The invoice was in our email inbox within 12 hours and it was to the penny as quoted on the reservation.  Bonus that this was $150.00 to $200.00 cheaper for a 13 day rental than the Hertz or Avis quotes.   We will not hesitate to rent from Enterprise again, their pickup service allows us to rent from a location other than the airport thus avoiding expensive taxes levied on vehicles picked up at airports.  This coupled with such professionalism makes for a very positive experience, something that is not a given when dealing with rent a car companies."
0,"Saturday afternoon, coming to the end of the lunchtime rush. I was pointed to a window seat as I was on my own and given a menu. Then I waited. And waited. And waited. \n\nI dallied with the idea that if I turned round to face the sushi chef, that I would have more of a chance of my order being taken, but given that that would be rather rude, I turned back again to face the window, but in a perky and expectant way. Don't ask me to repeat this, as it was hard enough the first time. \n\nFinally my order was taken. I went for the set lunch menu of nigiri, maki and miso with a green tea. I was craving miso on such a wintery day and figured that the rest of the meal would work, even if it did involve cucumber rolls, which to me is always a copout in sushi (it's a personal thing - it just doesn't have any flavour to me). I did throw in some spicy tuna rolls as well as I was hungry and figured on skipping the cucumber rolls. \n\nFor the first time in any Japanese restaurant, I was given one cup of tea, no pot. Given that I never saw the waitress again til I got the bill, I ended up being rather thirsty (note this is a tiny restaurant).\n\nFirst up was the spicy tuna rolls. It smelled rather strongly but tasted ok. Spicy, but not a huge amount of flavour. I did like the texture of the rice though. Next up was the chef's selection of nigiri which involved two pieces of squid - I'll put my hands up right now and say I didn't eat it. Tried it once, nearly choked, never again. I'm a safe sushi eater (tuna, salmon, eel and fish roe), and I am ok with that. Saying that, I thought it was a nice touch to include all varieties of fish in the selection so that the more adventurous get something with more bite. There was also some less than fresh looking tuna (I get it, it isn't native to here so going to be defrosted, but it looked really sad to me), salmon and egg. The cucumber rolls were overpoweringly doused in wasabi. The salmon rolls were ok, but not a lot of flavour. \n\nYou might wonder where my miso description went to, but it goes in last as that is when it turned up - after I reminded the waitress. Definitely, US miso is more salty as I experienced the same watery miso I had in other restaurants in town. I'll take that as noted. \n\nFinally, when I did get the bill, the waitress wasted no time in trying to take it away from me - even while I was still trying to get the cash out. Tip? Hell no. Would I be back, most likely not - there are better sushi joints in town. Prices are cheap, but you definitely get what you pay for and with raw fish, I would rather pay higher and make sure the fish doesn't try to return to the sea anytime soon."
0,"I haven't spent much time in Downtown Mesa, but this place catches my eye every time.  It's caddy-corner to the Mesa Arts Center, with a lively, inviting patio out front.  The inside is artistically decorated with some exposed brick and large paitings on one wall.  The other wall is a bar, serving a sizable wine list and bottles from several local breweries.  (No draft beers.)  There's also a small stage for live music.  It's a nice atmosphere for a date.\n\nUnfortunately, the food was lacking.  A crusty baguette was served before our meals with a homemade butter concotion that had way too many onions.  I ordered the fish of the day, escolar, served over vegetable risotto ($29).  The fish was cooked moist and succulent, but it was very buttery and carried some unrecognizable smoky flavor.  The risotto had a nice cheesy taste, but I didn't see many vegetables in it, and it was also very heavy and oily.  In between these layers were some tasty, vinegary wilted greens, but I could barely distinguish them sandwiched between the super rich fish and risotto.\n\nOn the plus side, my wife's salmon salad was a nice offering and good value ($11).  With asparagus, roasted red peppers, and multi-colored grape tomatoes, it was pleasing to the eye.  The piece of salmon on top was surprisingly large, and cooked perfectly medium rare.\n\nI'd definitely stop in for a drink or to relax on the patio, but I doubt I'll grab dinner again here any time soon."
1,"Free wing Fridays... oh yeah.  I don't even like wings usually, but Silky's knows how to cook 'em so they don't taste fatty.  Get a side of Atomic sauce, which is flavorful as well as hot.  I'd buy it by the bottle if I could.  The menu is huge, and everything I've had has been good.  I always get the home fries on the side, which are cooked with onions and fried jalapenos (!).  Great waitresses, too.  Would be five stars if it had decent air conditioning--in the summer, sitting inside is painful."
0,"Love love love the big eye tuna pizza....I don't remember anything else. Service was awful...I don't like when you ask if I'm sure I want to really pay 5 bucks for fresh wasabi n look like your surprised...I'm ordering it so bring it.rude. our server came around once in a while, never asked if we were ok or needed anything else...maybe i wanted to order more...oh well...ill do take out next time"
0,"First of all the place is just beautiful, views are amazing. I recommend having a drink on the balcony and going else where for dinner. First of all the service is slowwwwwwww. Once the beautifully looking food arrived we starting eating. Three of us ordered steak, one ordered med, came out med rare, two ordered med rare, both came out med to med well. Halibut also came out over cooked. I would have loved to share this with the waitress, but after the food was dropped off she never came once to check on us. Will definitely not be back."
1,"Excellent service, good food. Sticky Toffee Pudding is worth the price tag"
1,It's so hard to find a good hair salon and hairdresser. After reading the reviews on Yelp I decided to give it a try after having a disastrous haircut somewhere else. The staff here are super friendly and their prices are very good. I also got a great haircut! Keely paid a lot of attention to my hair type (medium curls) and gave me a great cut that makes my curls look awesome. I will definitely be coming back.
0,"We had been to this restaurant once for lunch, and enjoyed it enough to decide to go a second time for dinner. We had relatives visiting from overseas and decided to bring them to this restaurant because of the nice atmosphere of the location (Prince-Arthur). We had one of the worst experiences restaurant wise. We waited for more than 2 hours (literally) for our food, and once our dishes showed up, they were cold and over cooked. We have to mention that the restaurant was very busy, but still... We even had to ask 3-4 times to get water or bread (and at one point, early on,  they ran out of bread). We asked twice to talk to the owner (who we knew was on site) and he never showed up; which shows how much they cared. The poor waitress did apologize many times, but a lot of the issues were out of her control.  I would never go back to this place."
1,Haha It was a funny experience at this restaurant. My friend ordered the 4 patties burger! I ordered the 2 patties burger and my other friend ordered the 3 patties burger. Customer service is not top notch but it was ok.\n\nI will come back to this place whenever I'm in Vegas to enjoy a funny experience again. lol
1,"The food is great, and the staff are so nice and friendly. I will definitely be back."
0,1st pizza was a salt mine.  The 2ed had no cheese or sauce and needed a steak knife to cut.  Chicken parm was so-so.  Five stars for the staff who tried to make up for the kitchens's shortcomings.  Maybe 2.5 at best.  Also small pours of wine.
0,"I first experienced Ian's at the Chicago location.  Now granted the alcohol may have created a biased opinion, but after realizing there was an Ian's in Madison, I was immediately enthused.  The idea of putting delicious dishes onto pizza which is almost always delicious in and of itself is mind boggling for sure.\n\nUpon our arrival, we ordered 4 differnt slices to share and sample.  We took our treasures nearby lakeside to watch the sunset over bbq chicken, pesto alfredo, philly cheesesteak, and some other flavor I can't recall.  If it weren't for the scenery, the whole experience was wholly disappointing.  All four flavors were lacking in well, flavor.  The bbq chicken was the only decent of the four and the pesto was a far second.  Overall, it was quite the disappointment.\n\nI don't recommend eating at Ian's unless you've had a few, but I do encourage you to stray half a mile near the school's campus to partake in the live music and summer scene."
0,"Rotating resturants always pull me in and I hope that the food will be spectular and amazing. But it's not. I need to accept the only reason to go to a rotating resturant is for the mere fact that the place is rotating and there is a view of the skyline of whatever xyz city I am in.\n\nI came here late night only to get a glass of wine and dessert. The wine list was actually quite decent, but the basic house wines were just-ok California large labels =(  And the dessert wasn't good. They used dried raspberries... Bleh, and during berry season. No excuse for that... even if it was the '$7 special'.\n\nThe view is great, but for wine and dessert, even in comparison to other rotating resturants, they could do much, much better."
1,"A lot of us at Pucci go there for happy hour. They offer some great deals. Definitely try their soft shell crab slider, Incredible. Their food is pricey on the dinner menu but it is as fresh as it comes with great presentation. Go there"

I dropp the script off with the douche, temporary RX, and he said \""ughh we are a little backed up can you come back tomorrow?\"" I said No, it is a pain med that she should be taking in about a half hour at most. RX said \""uggh ok I will be a rush waiter and will be ready in 20 min.\"" \nScene 4 Rx is a dope and never calls me over to get it. After 40 min and several attempts to get his attention, I walk back up and ask Is my script ready yet. \nScene 5 Rx said \""uggh who is it for?\"" Looks on the filling station and nope not there, looks in the FILLED waiting to be picked up Not for people waiting or Rush scripts... bingo. \n\nIf you see they Rx that smells like garlic and may be dumber then a box of rocks... go eleswhere."
0,"This was a major disappointment.  We ordered Cheese curds. Greasy and bland. Nosh plate would have been better if the only thing offered was the salami. The onion pickle was way too sweet.  The herb farm cheese had an Indian spiced flavor. At this point I'm not sure how all these flavors can cohesively compete. And that's it!  They can't.  Mac n cheese was grainy and not hot enough.  The chicken and waffles was very disappointing.  The waffle was difficult to eat with a fork. I cut it and it kept crumbling. The white cheddar tasted like it was a powder...the kind you sprinkle on popcorn. Not good.  The chicken tasted over brined mixed with the breading, it was competing. The one dish I did enjoy was the skirt steak.  Perfectly cooked, nice mushroom gravy and mashed potatoes. We finished with a chocolate and caramel cake. Good but not great.  I liked that it was not overly sweet.  It was a little dry.\nThe service could have been better. It took some time to get drinks and to order.  The runner had no clue who ordered what. Slow on drink refill. The table could have been cleared before we received our cake. We had to ask for forks for the cake.  It was a cool space.  Too bad the food just didn't do it for me."
1,"I was in joy when seeing the sign while wandering around with the bf. \nwe're seated immediately at the comfortable table. As usual, I did the ordering, and my eyes are always bigger than my stomach. \nWe had chicken and waffles which was something different to try, but tasty,  steak sandwich - very good, fried calamari with rock shrimp - an excellent dish, salad & soup combo which was nothing special, we didnt  even finish half of it. However, each portion was way bigger than I thought. For the drink, my bf had beer, while I got orange & strawberry smoothie in a big glass was super good that I kept drinking instead of eating food, but still couldnt finish, therefore I had to ask my bf to suck it up 'cause I didnt want to waste it. \nI love the service here, my waiter was nice, friendly & attentive, he came by few times to ask if everything was ok, and another gentleman which I guessed its the manager came over to check on us making sure we're well served. With an awesome service & food like this, I would love to come any time."
1,Still brewing great stuff! The place is looking better - its come a long way since they moved in!\n\nThere are plenty of new brewed offerings. The high-ABV crowd should take note - they've got some good stuff here!\n\nBarrel-aged lovers - keep your eye on this place. Matt has a growing collection of barrels stacking up. He promises more wine and whiskey barrel-aged goodness is coming. The current barrel-aged stuff was tart and tasty while I was there last week...
1,"Roses you say? This place has the most beautiful ones I've EVER seen in Madison. Every time I order from them, I'm not disappointed.Yes, I'm picky. I'm picky about what goes in the vase. No RED roses, leather leaf, babies breath, or carnations for this girl. When I called George's to place my order, they let me speak directly to a designer. The recipient of the flowers was thrilled and I was thrilled with the excellent customer service, and product. If it's Roses you want, in the most intersting, elegant, lovely, arrangement, or just by themselves, call George's. And please, no carnations, leather leaf, babies breath or RED roses. There is so much more out there if you just ask."
1,"This is one of my absolutely favorite places to eat. Here is my guide to having a 5 star experience at this restaurant. \n\n1. Make reservations a few weeks in advance to be sure to get the time slot you are interested it. They fill up fast.\n\n2. Go for an occasion, not a holiday. Go because its your birthday, or you are celebrating a big business deal. Not on Valentines Day. This is not me saying it would be bad on Valentine's Day, but most people get frustrated when its busy at places like this and don't realize that, well, yeah...its VALENTINE'S DAY. (If you can set the right expectations then HECK YEAH go on Valentine's Day)\n\n3. DO NOT and I repeat DO NOT take your kids here. It is not that the staff wouldn't be amazing to your kids, it is the fact that most people are here for a quiet night out, not a screaming 2 year old. (I leave my screaming 2 year old at home.) Here's the catch, if your kid is old enough to enjoy a good meal and experience and you would like some one on one time with them to perhaps congratulate them on good grades etc, this may not be a bad idea. Again...screaming 2 year old = NO.\n\n4. Finding deals for this place is also a good tip. Sometimes you will see coupons in your local mailer, or you can sign up for their newsletter. If not prepare yourself for a high bill. Same as when you go to Fogo de Chao. You know you are going to a nice place, you also know you are paying for it. Go in with a good mindset and be expecting it and it wont shock you, either that or drink some of their fabulous cocktails and then you wont care!\n\n5. Booths with privacy curtains. Don't ask. However be aware that they do have them and they can be fun. (Assuming here, I have never sat in one).\n\n6. Last but not least and most important. I do not care if you are on a diet, or diabetic, or hate chocolate (what kind of nut are you). Make time, don't eat for a week, take insulin, and have the chocolate fondue. This is absolutely amazing and worth the trip every time!\n\nFollow my 6 steps and you will have a great time at The Melting Pot!"
1,"Ce petit caf\u00e9 de l'avenue du Parc est plut\u00f4t charmant. L'ambiance est d\u00e9contract\u00e9e et on voit d\u00e9filer les habitu\u00e9s tout au long de la journ\u00e9e.

0,"We stayed in The Suite. Let me be clear. I wanted and expected fancy for this special trip. I got average. \n\nWhen I drop $200 a night, I don't want any dust in the room, I don't want a badly damaged chair and I don't want to pay $4 for a crappy in-room coffee. Yes, my friends. They charge $4 for a cheap room coffee. I used to stay in much, much cheaper places where this little perk was free. \n\nSo, if you want to be treated well, if you don't want to wait for 45 minutes to check in on a Tuesday afternoon (like we did 2 days ago), then go to The VEnetian or The Bellagio."
0,"The only reason this place got two stars instead of 1 is because I loved the atmosphere. The couches, high top tables, bar and decor are all fantastic and decorated with great taste. \n\nHOWEVER, the service sucked! and the food was mediocre. We waited 15 minutes before anyone even approached us! We finally flagged down a waitress from another section and that's when our waitress showed up immediately looking bitter that another girl was stealing her tip. (We could care less; just wanted to order finally.)\n\nAdditionally, the food was meh. The sliders were ok, but the bun was stale and gross. I got the goat cheese pizza. The veggie one was ok, the prosciutto was better. The cherry tomatoes were a bad topping though. They kept squirting every time I bit into the pizza.\n\nYet, after getting service, food, and drinks things were better. This is place to come with a group otherwise expect to get no attention..."
0,"What is going on Flamingo? This has been our go to place several times a year for the past 5 years. Great location but the service has gone downhill!  Wed. before Thanksgiving, 1400 guests expected, yet only 3 people checking folks in. Line for keys was even longer!! Took longer than usual to get our baggage, got to room and keys not working. Stay tuned for room rating..."
1,"The Desert Botanical Gardens in Phoenix, AZ is a great way to get a sample of Arizona's diverse and spectacular flora.  Check out The Gardens in the spring, when all of the plant and flowers are blooming in beautiful, vibrant colors.  This is a great place to take visiting relatives who love to garden or are just nature buffs.   It's an easy walking adventure with many cozy benches to sit and bird or nature watch.  Midway through the journey is a nice spot to enjoy a little refreshment and sample some yummy treats.  At the end of your journey is a great gift shop with books, jewelry and even plants found on the garden grounds for sale.  Visit when the day time temperatures are moderate and you're guaranteed to have an enjoyable time.  Be sure to wear sunscreen and bring a camera.  Don't forget to have fun!"
0,Have stood here waiting over 30 min with 2 people ahead of me Line has NOT moved. Employees could care less. Understaffed....This is ridiculous. ..never coming back to this location.
1,"Being a stingy storage monger, I called around a bit until I landed on Iron City - the prices were reasonable, it's clean, climate controlled, and easy to get to on Bigelow. The guys were friendly, they do a month-to-month contract (no cancellation fees) and they can auto-debit an account for you. There are also plenty of dollies and moving equipment to run out to your vehicle, if you are unable (like myself) to carry more than two boxes without risking your life. \n\n2 tips: \n1. Bring your own lock - I was a rookie, but didn't expect they'd charge something like $12 (I don't remember, but it was something I could've bought at Home Depot for $4) for a simple padlock. \n2. If you sign up for auto-pay, call after the first month and make sure they set it up correctly. Apparently the guy who i signed up with forgot to put my paperwork through, and they called me saying I owed them money. We fixed it right away, but just in case - follow up."
0,I went to this store 3 times trying to purchase a necklace for my wife's birthday. Owner won't sell. Maybe because I'm not white ... she won't even hear out my offer. Will not be back.

1,"Just ate here and it was phenomenal. We had seen a prix fixe menu online on the Golden Nugget website and carelessly forgot to print it. Our waiter was super nice and printed it for is and allowed us to order from it. Thanks :)\n\nI had the filet and the husband had the fish of the day (halibut). My filet was perfectly medium rare and the sides, au gratin potatoes, were to die for. For real. I'd die for them. Husband's halibut was a bit dry on top, but the flavor was very good. We also got bread pudding for dessert. Amazeballs. The other two diners we were with enjoyed their meals as well. Lobster bisque is apparently fabulous and the roasted chicken was perfect. \n\nGo here. Spend the money ($50 for a 3 course, with side, prix fixe). You will not be disappointed."
1,"In a city full of bars and clubs, this one holds its own by being a dive bar.. only las vegas style... people don't come here in jeans unless their american rag but at least you can get in somewhere with jeans, right? In any case, this is a nice placeto set up shop when you feel like going out, but not going all out."
0,"WORSE GROUPON I EVER BOUGHT!\nbuyers beware! The reviews I thought were related to this business are actually for a Pristine House Cleaning based out of Ohio.\n\nProblems:\n- The girls left 40 minutes before the 3 hours I paid for! I tipped them 12 dollars because honestly I figured they were having a horrible day since they were so unfriendly. I wanted to remind them they were paid for 3 hours, but I figured I didn't want them in my home if they didn't want to be here!\n- Being almost 1.5 hours late!\n- They BROKE my blender. I went to use it today and it is indeed clean, but there is water in it. Their website states they clean small appliances. They do, but after they clean them they no longer work. Oh, and it wasn't a cheap one and less than two months old. \n- They only cleaned a small bathroom and my kitchen. My home isn't THAT dirty. It is deep cleaned on a regular basis and we have a weekly cleaner. 3 hours and TWO rooms were cleaned? I was worried they wouldn't have enough to do in three hours with the whole house.\n\nBasically, If I had known I was going to have to wait 1.5 hours for them to show up, I would have spent that hour and a half cleaning my own house! This company is a total joke and waste of time. They really lack brains, skills, professionalism and customer service. I already contacted groupon to tell them I want my $$ back.\n\nWORSE PART:  I dont smoke. The cleaners left their dirty butts on my porch. GROSS!"
1,"I usually come here to trade in my no longer needed games. If you are a rewards member you can usually get an extra few bucks for used games and get used games a bit cheaper. If you do a lot of transactions this way the membership pays for itself and it comes with a video game magazine subscription. You can sell recently released games on eBay and usually make a few more dollars. Selling older games usually will land you the same price as a trade in, when you factor in shipping and the fee eBay charges to sell their stuff. As a rewards member they will have a lot of promos and sales exclusively for you. If you're patient you rack in on some great deals.\n\nThe employees have always been nice to me and they know their games. The store itself is packed with as many games and accessories as they can allow. As most of my friends and nephews are hardcore gamers a gift card from here has always helped around birthdays and holidays."
1,I just had a haircut done by Roxanne at The Root today. First of all the salon is really clean and pretty. Very beautifully decorated. As soon as I walked in the door I was offered a drink of water or soda and also offered the use of one of those coffee machines. I sat around waiting and the appointment did start about 15-20 minutes after my appointment time but I was hanging with my mom and there were plenty of magazines (plus cookies and water/soda) so no problem.\nThen Roxanne came over and introduced herself. We talked about how I wanted my hair as she gently combed it out and she even pulled out a comb to measure how much I wanted cut off which was really awesome since I always worry they will cut too much. She was charming and chatty throughout the haircut and it was really fun to talk to her and hear her tips. \nThe result: I absolutely love my haircut. She listened really well to what I was asking for and gave me exactly what I had in mind. I will most definitely be coming back for my haircuts in the future. Thanks Roxanne!!!
0,"My daughter rented a truck to help me complete my relocation process.  We cancelled our reservation with U-Haul (bad mistake) becasue we were supposedly getting a better deal with Budget. Quite frankly it would have been if Tonya (Customer Service Rep at this location)had stuck with the original order. We did not select insurance coverage when making the reservation online because we had already verified with our State Farm Agent (the best one EVER) that we were already covered for the contents and the truck and their beloved Loss of Use. However, a clever little game they seem to have of changing your original reservation (which was a 10' truck) to a 12' truck because suddenly they \""didn't have any available 10' trucks\"", and oops suddenly she couldn't tell I had declined her coverage.  Keeping in mind the reservation was verified the night before pick up and this was not told to us at that time. But this is the kicker, although they gave us the same rental amount, TONYA STACKED AND PACKED INSURANCE ON IT.  By that I mean, she told my daughter  which box to check and where to sign. My daughter asked her what it was and she told my daughter \""it is required to protect our truck and you have to have it\"". This blitz cost us $108.00, which is more than the \""break\"" they gave us on a truck bigger than we wanted, needed or reserved.  Their supposed customer service Manager Jose, called to \""get her story\"" then gets back on the line and tells me that my daughter had an option. Well we all have choices and mine is not only to fight this charge but to make as many people aware as possible of the shady dealings from this office as well as to check with your insurance carrier. Chances are you already pay for enough coverage that you wouldn't need additional. They like to use a scare tactic, especially to younger people it would appear, that your insurance will not cover loss of use and if something happened to take the truck out of commission they would charge your credit/debit card the daily rate for it. Well, that is quite the tactic since not many can afford that to happen. But, like I said CHECK WITH YOUR INSURANCE AGENT first, then insist denial of theirs.  I checked for us ahead of time to ensure our insurance had it covered and Budget still got us.  My daughter is still living in Charlotte and will be shouting this experience from the rooftops in hopes that companies will quit preying on people."
1,"Simply put, if you like chicken fried steak and you haven't been here you don't really like chicken fried steak.  I've eaten chicken fried steak pretty much everywhere in the world that its available and it just doesn't get much better than this.  Go with the fried potatoes instead of the mashed.  Not that the mashed are bad, just that the fried potatoes are so GOOD.  For those that are less enthusiastic about chicken fried steak, the fried chicken breast is also great as are the steaks and burgers.  Love the house salad with light oil dressing and diced olives on top.  Oh, and the biscuits, top notch, TOP NOTCH.  Don't let them get away with bringing you a bread basket that's half filled with biscuits and half filled with some wheat roll disaster, ask for all biscuits.  You're welcome."
0,The bartender stayed on the phone almost the entire time. Never once asked about our food. She was too worried about her 2 buddies on the other side of the bar. This was during lunch. Also no seasoning on the fries and never brought blue cheese as requested.
0,"I have been here a few times in the past but was never impressed. The only reason I was back was for a concert. \n\nThe people at the door had the worst attitudes I have ever come across. They acted like their job was some type of successful career or something. The first bartender we went to seemed irritated and rushed us for a drink order even though we were the ONLY people there. \n\nI had one beer and was kicked out for being \""drunk\"".  I wasn't even buzzed. This is after I paid $28 to see a band. I'm sorry if I looked like I was struggling but my heels were uncomfortable!!! When I tried to nicely explain this to someone, they took the word of the other less intelligent bouncer. I could understand if I actually did something wrong but I didn't. \n\nI will never go back to this place again."
0,"Boyfriend has been a customer here for 3 years & we've brought all our cars here. Had a incident happen here yesterday (7/2/14) around 6:25 PM.  We had been taking pictures earlier that day at Mt. Charleston so the car was filthy with bugs, & dust. No other way around it but it had to be cleaned.\n\nBRIAN our cashier listed on the receipt, was directing us STRAIGHT. I was there in the passenger seat when we heard a bang inside the car, the rim hit the railing.  We came to a stop & put the car window down to ask Brian how bad was it.  He said to us, \""You're good bro,  you didn't even touch it\"".   Which was a LIE to our faces. We finished the wash & they wiped the car down. We drove to Arroyo plaza to see we CLEARLY hit it. Brian wasn't truthful with us.\n\nWe rushed back before they were closed. We drove back & spoke with Eric.  He says, \""Come here BRO\"", & showed us the railing which, has a SHARP edge where the metals meet. THAT'S what caused the damage, NOT us.\n\nThe car is 3 weeks old, late model 2013 Genesis coupe with 1,000 miles on it. We figured we'd bring it here because we've gotten our cars tinted & liked the customer service.   Such a shame you rather lose a long term customer over something simple.  I don't understand how you wouldn't care enough about somebody as loyal to keep coming back for 3 YEARS.  Not to mention my boyfriend has referred customers their way before.\n\nSTILL we had faith they would do the right thing & refinish the wheel. NOTHING.  How about an APOLOGY from Brain himself?  What's going to be done about him LYING to customers about damage?\n\nEventually after Tim the CEO called my boyfriend at work he was told Curtis would get back to him & he was not forgotten.  My boyfriend became concerned after 6 PM he had not heard from him, so he called and asked for Curtis, to which he replies to my boyfriend, \""I thought TIM & spoke to you about this\"". Curtis won't return his calls. He gives off the \""nice guy\"" vibe in face to face tells us as we walked out to the car this morning, \""there's Nothing I can do about aftermarket wheels\"". We told him the car was a month old, & they were factory wheels. To which he replies, \""Oh $#it they are factory wheels.... I'm sorry I shouldn't of assumed\"".  He seemed like a nice guy when he apologized for the assumption.\n\nHERE'S what pissed us off! Curtis was telling both of us this morning (8:30 AM), he had a guy come in with wide wheels & stretched tires. He offered to pay HALF, yet he won't offer us the same.. Shrugged off when this is the first time we've ever complained. We've never caused any problems. Curtis mentioned he's had some irate customers in the past.  We're good people, we wanted this resolved..  We like bringing our business to family owned places as much as possible.\n\nCurtis seemed nice face to face when he told us he treats his customer complaints as serious as if it was his own mother. Where is that outstandingly nice guy? The copy he sent us of the recording of the video, it was very poor quality & he's was using his camera phone.  Showing the two cameras at the entrance of the car wash. I wish I could upload the video on yelp, i will describe it as best I can. You can't see anything as far as hand gestures from Brian, he's a shadowy figure. You see the car pulling in with the wheel straight, then as it's approaching the rail to the entrance,  it's turned to the right & stops.  As I'm watching this is disbelief, I can hear Curtis say, \""Tells him to turn, tells him to turn.. and THAT'S what causes the damage\"".  The way he lied on his copy of the recording made things even worse. I thinking to myself you can completely see what happening despite the phone shaking as he's recording.  He even backed it up (as if it wasn't clear enough). Still the same thing,  wheel is straight car is pulling in forward motion & very last minute turns right & we stop when we hit the rail. There's no mistaking that. Regardless it happened on their lot due to their employee directing us in. I feel like they should be held at fault for having that sharp side of the rail sticking out! That's failure to maintain the railing.\n\nWe've tried being reasonable & calm but apparently that doesn't work. We've been respectful & that got us no where.  It takes class to try to resolve things appropriately..   I waited to hear back from my boyfriend hoping I wouldn't have to write a negative review.. Which I always try to avoid & give the benefit of the doubt, especially if someone has had a long day.\n\nUPDATED:\nSteer clear of here. The railings here have no rubber to prevent damage & there is a sharp edge we caught with our factory rim. They could care less. They hire liars & thieves. An ex firefighter had his truck detailed here. The guy detailing his truck stole his ipod & ended up getting arrested. Can't make that up. Alamo Hand Car Wash (Russell & Rainbow) inside the Arco Gas station. It's the same price $7.99 for an express wash. Yelp check-ins get 50% too! You're welcome."
0,"I don't tend to write reviews, but when it comes or a person's health, I feel compelled to share my experience to help others.  I also understand narcotics are regulated, but this was obviously a failure and hopefully a learning experience for this youthful physician (I also have requested a survey from Nextcare so that maybe they can reevaluate their process and procedure with either selecting physicians or general philosophy).  \n\nI broke my hand on July 6, 2014.  I broke 2 bones.  I saw my primary physician and then went to a hand surgeon.  I had surgery 4 days later to install 4 metal pins in my hand.  We alternated pain medication week by week between Norco (strong Vicodin) and Percocet (a stronger pain medication), depending on my pain level.  There were times that the only drug that would let me sleep was Percocet.  My hand surgeon and staff always asked me about my pain level.  Basically I would stay with Norco unless the pain level was not enough to let me sleep then I'd take a Percocet.  Really no big deal, I mean I have a bunch of metal sticking in and out of my hand, it's going to get painful at times. \n\nI had surgery on Tuesday 08/05 to remove the pins.  For those that have gone through surgery, sometimes the pain is masked for days due to the different drugs given during the operation and post-op.  I left the surgery center with a heavily bandaged splint and Norco for pain.  I followed post op instructions and on Friday, removed the splint and band aid the areas where the exposed pins were.  I was surprised at how swollen my hand was.  Saturday night got painful and did not sleep much.  On a Sunday 08/10, I pushed through the day and later in the afternoon recognized Norco would not do the trick with pain radiating from swelling beneath my pinkie area (I was not sure why maybe it is a nerve).  Anyway, I went to Nextcare since you need a paper prescription for Percocet and my doctor is closed.  My next appt with the hand surgeon was on Thursday on the other side of town (I'm a busy professional and have already taken 6 days worth of PTO and maxed my deductible) and I couldn't go another day without sleep. The nurse took my blood pressure and it was through the roof 152/90, I am normally 118/78.  The nurse acknowledged this was probably due to the pain.  I also gave the nurse my prescription records from walgreens showing my medication and the above information.  The last time I was ever prescribed pain medication was at least a decade ago, I'm obviously not an addict.  Then waited for the doctor.  The doctor came in (she was young, maybe 30).  Didn't bother to ask me what I was doing currently to manage the pain and said \""I don't prescribe Percocet\"".  Then she said (why didn't you call before you came, which I replied because this is a walkin Urgent Care clinic, I mean really... I need to call a walkin clinic before I walk in?).  That was it, she didn't ask any questions!  No options, didn't ask what type of pain, where exactly is it emanating, no probing questions didn't determine my needs and/or short term treatment plan until my follow up with my hand surgeon a few days later.  I was absolutely shocked that no dr/patient protocol was followed.  I walked out the door, feeling absolutely shocked at what just happened.  I believe I was misdiagnosed as a drug seeker.  She didn't even look at my hand!  I'm sure she gets a fair share of drug addicts.  But this is where experience, clear headed evaluation and diagnosis, and care needs to come in... and it didn't happen.  \n\nConversely, I immediately went to an Urgent Care Extra and got an experienced physician (mid-50s) who looked at my hand, asked me a lot of questions (rightfully so).  I offered to show my prescription records like Nextcare demanded, she said it wasn't necessary she can tell I am in elevated pain.  She created a short term treatment plan of ibuprofen and Percocet, ice pack to help with the swelling and I was taken care of.  It really didn't take a rocket scientist to diagnose and treat my hand.  \n\nLong story short, Nextcare has moved to the bottom of my list for urgent treatment if they have a list of physicians like the one I experienced."
0,"Yesterday was my second experience with Classic Car Spa, first at this particular location. Once again I was disappointed and wasted 2 hours of my life. They always have a third party glass sales to point out all your glass imperfections (and at my first visit, the gentleman was forward, suggestive, and suggested an adult meet up) I waited for 1.5 hrs for a 20 min car wash. When I finally asked to speak with the manager (the cashier was less than competent with my inquiries and complaints) he explained that it was his initial check in employee that failed to do his job, costing me an additional 60 minutes of waiting for my vehicle. I asked him if he could somehow make up the time this mistake cost me, explaining that I did not want to come back, and he offered me $5 off my next wash. I am extremely hesitant to ever attempt another car wash at this location, or at another Classic Car Spa. He then walked me out to my car, at which point I once again noticed that the level of \""Supreme Wash\"" is very minimal, pathetic at best. My hood, windows and doors were covered with spots that I was able to rub off with the pad of my finger, no nail required. When I asked about the spots, he explained that to remove these spots I would need to pay extra for a \""detail\"" service. So my $24.99 Supreme Wash was not enough to actually clean my car, that costs extra. He did ask an employee over to clean the blatant huge bug spots off my front bumper and grill before I left. He then took the opportunity to upsell me to a \""buff\"" job to remove all the scratches on my paint. He's right, I do need that, but there is no way I am trusting that job to this location. Overall, the exterior received a superficial \""wash\"" and some Armor All on the tires to make them look shiny. The windshield was also covered in spots, possibly sap. The interior was rubbed down with an Armor All rag, and all the lint, hairs and dust were still there, just smeared around on the now shiny surfaces. I will say that they did vacuum, that was one successful job. Overall, once again the experience was a painful and frustrating waste of time. I wish I had gone to a drive through $6 car wash because my car always looks better after those. Somehow the spots come off through those...huh. And it takes all of 5 minutes of my life. My advice, find a faster, cheaper option OR find a location that will be worth the money and time you spend to get the job done right."
0,"I was there for a work dinner...I sat next to a co-workers wife who I did not know. We both ordered the 8oz fillet cooked medium; they both came back rare. We sent them back, which was no big deal, I had my sides on my plate and hers on her plate. They returned both our steaks, unfortunately they did not replete them on new plates AND they put my steak on her plate and her steak on my plate, we only knew this because we had different sides. VERY amature. Our server could care 'o less...he was probably upset that the wine we ordered wasn't $300 a bottle. I pointed out the error, they were semi-concerned. I didn't really complain, but wasn't too happy. The manager came over and apparently knew what happened, she graciously took both of our meals off the bill. I was appreciative. I would still not go back."
0,"I don't know how this place has stayed in business for so long.  It has never appealed to me, yet some family member drags me there every five years or so.  It never changes. It seems like an independently owned Chili's.  The menu is boring.  The food nothing special.  \n\nMost recently, I ordered a salad and asked for some rolls or bread and they didn't have anything except for some super spongy Italian sliced bread that tasted like a step up from wonder bread.  My beet salad had such crunch beets they were barely cooked.  Grapefruit segments were all membrane.  Lettuce was ice cold, nearly frozen.  \n\nSee you in another five years."

1,"Went there with a few friends during happy hour and it was excellent from moment one!! The service as wonderful, so attentive at all the right times and left us to talk and eat for the rest of of the evening!  Because we got there at happy hour, the combinations were discounted 20% and most of the drinks are half off so we were paying around $6 a drink. The food was very delicious and fresh! The meats were high quality meats and very tender. I want to go back already!"
0,Food was good till you go in the restroom. Terrible sewer smell and the next day stomach was not very happy!
1,Finally can try Bobby Flay's restaurant last week. Food  was same as what I expected but the reason I only give 4 star was because they were a bit overprice.
0,Overpriced for what they offer.  $7 for a double scoops of glorified ice cream.  It's not gelato.  I've been to Europe and know what gelato is.
0,"The bartender at Geisha was not friendly nor had a smile on her face ever. She became annoyed and hostile with us when having to correct our order. We asked that our edamame could have less salt and her response was \""That's not possible.\"" Not sure where her customer service skills were hidden but I sure hope she finds them in a haste manner.  Wishing her the best of luck since it seems like it will be hunting for a needle in a haystack."
0,"Regis at University Square used to be my backup salon, but since it was torn down and my usual salon was booked up, I decided to try the Regis Salon at West Towne.  \n\nThe salon was clean, the staff was polite and relatively speedy.  The stylist I had was very friendly and asked lots of questions, which was great and I thought I was happy with the cut until I got home and really got a chance to take a look at it.  She styled it very nicely, but I guess she just assumed that I would always want to style it exactly the same way, because as soon as I moved a hair it was a disaster area.  \n\nI asked for a layered collar-bone length cut with a bit of texture and long side bangs.  I ended up with bangs that were two inches longer on the right side of my face, hair an inch longer on the right side, completely blunt ends that were at least two inches below my collar bone.  I look like I had my hair cut by a one-eyed high schooler.  If I wasn't leaving town tomorrow I would go back in and demand they fix it. \n\nOnly giving two points because of the clean and friendly atmosphere and that one stylist put on Muse for awhile.  \n\nI'm sorry I didn't wait and go to Studio 924."
1,Can't wait to go back and try more!
1,"Food gets you from point a to point b. Nothing special, but it's convenient and right next to the sports book. I wouldn't seek this place out but I have no issue eating here every time I'm hungover. It's location gets it a 4star."
1,AZO has many strains at great prices.  Professional budtenders who are very knowledgeable!
1,"This is a loooong overdue review! Sorry Rebel!\nI took my car to the ford dealership to get my check engine light diagnosed. 3 or more hours later they want me to buy a new radiator, serp belt and a couple of other small things for 2,000 without labor. Out the door I went. (review to come on Ford)\nI asked around on FB if anyone knew a great mom and pop mechanic and I was lead to Rebel. \nI was greeted right away when I walked in. I told the tech what the dealership told me was wrong and asked for an estimate of what the charges would be. While I waited for my estimate we went upstairs and played some FREE arcade games! They are a bit old, and some don't work but it was a fun way to pass the time.\nThe tech came and found us and gave me an estimate which i agreed on. I left my car with them for the work to be done for pickup later. They were done before the time they told me, and my car runs excellent!!!!!\n\nThumbs waaaaaay up Rebel Automotive! I will be back in the future for any other work my car needs! I am a beyond satisfied customer!!!! If I could give more stars I would!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n\n-------SUPPORT SMALL BUSINESSES!!!!!!!!!-------"
1,"A friend and I decided to grab some quick appetizers after work because I was about to eat my shoe. I had heard the lobster bisque was very tasty at LAVO and it just happened to be down the way from me...so off we went. \n\nMy friend was super boring and just had a crown and 7...I on the other hand went for broke (yet again) on the calorie meter.I started with one of their signature cocktails called the Lavolini. It was a yummy and somewhat tart mixture of prosecco, St. Germain (so good) and passion fruit puree. Of course I ordered the soup which was bloody fantastic with a sherry mascarpone creme. Very decadent and so yummy. Next course was a Kobe beef carpaccio with an arugula salad, pepper corns, parmesan and black truffle oil (you know I LOVE all things black truffle). It was heaven...so flavorful and again very rich. \n\nSteven, the bartender, was lovely. He brought us out some garlic bread but I could only tackle one piece before I waved the white flag of surrender....BUT just for giggles I wanted to look at the dessert menu...and there I spot it....FRIED OREO ZEPPOLES with a vanilla malt on the side. I dug deep inside myself and made some extra room in my tummy for this dessert gift from God. It was one of the best desserts that I have EVER had. Plus I ordered the Noce dessert cocktail with Nocello, Godiva chocolate liqueur and vanilla vodka. Perfect ending to a wonderful meal. My friend and I couldn't finish the oreos so we shared the wealth with the ladies next to us who were drooling over them. So fun when you meet new people. Thank you LAVO, Steven and Nicole...we will be back soon."
0,"Deplorable...Horrible service. Sucked, big time for me to even consider taking time out of my schedule to write this review. (I never write reviews!)\n\nTried to call in an order and was literally placed on hold for over 15 minutes. I purposely waited patiently thinking, \""Ok, they must be busy. Someone will pick up and courteously ask me to remain on hold for a bit longer.\"" NO, didn't happen. Not even once. \n\nI hung up and called right back, and before I could greet her again I was getting ready to be automatically placed on hold again until I yelled out, \""Wait! I've already been on hold for 15 minutes. Can you please just take my order real quick. I know what I want. It's simple.\"" Angela said she was the only one there with a line out the door. Well, if she had taken my order over the phone within the first 5 minutes of holding, or told me that they couldn't take phone orders at that time, I could have driven over & had my food within the same time frame that I was placed on hold. She wanted to place me on hold for another 15 minutes until she got her line taken care of. WTH!\n\nThey need to have more cashiers during rush hour or close phone hours during that time. Something has to give in the name of Customer Service. How many orders did they miss by not having someone there to take phone orders only during rush hour, 5pm on a Monday? Many!\n\nAs far as food...\nTried the Atomic Hot, and those are just ridiculously hot for no reason. No flavor...just way beyond habanero spicy, like they picked every possible super spicy herb & said \""Just throw it on there\"". Sauce dropped on my arm and literally whelped my skin. Even my finger tips burned from the sauce. o.O No Bueno!\n\nTried the Chile Lime...tastes like they just used Taco Seasonings with a splash of lime. They were okay, but I was in the mood for chicken wings, not tacos. Palette was confused.\n\nI guess the best thing to do is to Keep It Simple...Lemon Pepper & Original Hot...Plus choose a location that has better customer service. Which means, I probably won't be eating Wingstop anytime soon because I'm not driving across town to another location. My hubby's homemade Lemon Pepper & Hot Wings are AWESOME! We just didn't feel like greasing up the kitchen this evening."
0,"Although the decor is pretty this place is pretty ghetto. \n\nI was shocked at all the good reviews, but realized most of them weren't for the hotel itself. \n\nOur room was dirty with hairs from the previous guest in the sink (it was clogged) and bathtub, the floor had a lot of stains on it, hardly any of the television stations advertised worked alongside the buttons on the phone. When I drove in from LA on a Wednesday morning I was informed there would be parties from 10am-6pm and again at 10pm-6am. Since when do hotels take preference to the low budget crowd vs. hotel guests during weekdays? There was no room in the hotel that could avoid the awful music. Even when the place was empty they were bumping some type of techno. \n\nWhen I attempted to express my issue with the front desk it was discarded and I was given an \""oh well\"". Extremely bad customer service and room service (Mood). I will never come here again."
1,"Easily wins the best ramen in Montreal contest if there ever was one! I've been here twice, and the food is A-MA-ZING!  The Tuna Salmon bowl that I had almost a year ago still brings a smile to my face when I think of the experience! \n\nThe only thing that's hard about the place is the long lineup wait (unpleasant when cold outside) and the feeling like you're eating in a fish bowl. Everyone in line, stares at you. Probably wait for you to get out, or out of sheer envy of you sitting down and eating. I would have totally 5 starred this place if it wasn't for this feeling.  It was less like that during my second visit, but seriously wish it could be bigger. More Kazu for the people!"
0,"When I lived in VA, I was minutes away from the original Five Guys location.I can tell you that the Las Vegas outpost tastes exactly as I remember.\n\nThe bad news is, I remember Five Guys burgers being overcooked grease bombs and their fries burnt, over-seasoned wastes of good ingredients. And both of those things are still the case and all the free peanuts and Coke Freestyle machines in the world can't save hockey puck patties and fries cooked to orange.\n\nThey do serve a delicious and juicy hot dog however, one that doesn't overpower the soft rolls they serve. I recommend the dog topped with bacon, cheese and fresh jalape\u00f1os. But it's like six bucks.\n\nIf you like everything well done, this is your spot.\n\nAlso, you're dead to me."
0,"I am a mom of 3.  Our first visit here was very frustrating.  There was a fieldtrip there during our visit and it was way too crowded.  We gave it another shot and it was better but there are still some really irritating things about it. I find it so frustrating that they do not allow you to bring your own food when all they offer is junk. Also, having to walk by the candy to go in is just stupid.  Clearly this is not a place that cares about the well-being of children but is looking for every angle to make money.  It is also unnecessary to have TVs on while kids are jumping and playing.  When parents are paying a lot to enter they certainly don't want their kids sitting and watching TV.  I think there are some good roots to this place. I only hope they take some steps to make it a positive experience for parents and children."
0,"Please do something about the employees there! Constantly smoking right outside the door so you have to smell it when walking in. Never doing anything behind the counter when you walk in, but too busy counting cigarrettes or whatever to help you pay. Ridiculousy long conversations with customers, or friends in the store, oh, free drinks form the fountain too if you know them. Apparantly are trading discounts with the nearby sushi place too. \n\nINFURIATING!"
0,"This club is definitely one of my least favorite clubs on the Vegas strip.  My experience here is based on my personal opinion and may vary person by person, which is likely especially because a club experience is so different for everyone.\n\nAnyway, besides the long lines and the JAM-PACKED and OVERCROWDED space/rooms (which I am aware of because after all, it is a club right?), I also did not like the music (before the headlining DJ came on) and the policy here.  The drinks average nearly $20 each and water is a whopping $9 for a tiny fiji bottle.  They DO NOT serve tap water so you have to buy a tiny bottle of water just to stay hydrated.\n\nI think all in all, because this club is overcrowded, overpriced, and just blah music, I likely won't be coming here and rather have a better, safer experience at XS or Marquee."
0,"I've heard all the hype and wanted to try it.  Tonight was my second attempt here.   First time, new girl on the grill apologized to me at 10 minutes, at 15 I walked.  Not even an acknowledgement from the wait staff.   Tonight, the waiter seemed mad that I didn't know what I wanted to order.  After I explained that I'd never been there, he brought me a menu and then proceeded to ignore me for 10 minutes.  I walked again.  No more tries here.  Maybe I'm doing something wrong?  Haha."
1,"This is by far the most exciting thing I've done in vegas. I come to vegas once a year and this was the first time doing this.  I'm not huge into exotic cars and I'd rather not wreck one so I chose the muscle car experience.  My buddy and I did the last tour of the day which was great.  My favorite modern day muscle car is the gt500 so it was a no brainer when I saw they had it. At over 660hp it was a lot to control if you put your foot down on it. You must be very cautious and pay attention to keep it straight and out of the ditch.  People complained about the clutch and stalling but I had no problems.  The z06 suprised me because im not a big fan but it had brute power,  not quite like the shelby but it had that v8 torque that throws you back.  The car that really suprised me was the challenger. Sure it wasn't all that fast but it handled great in turns. I think better than the shelby and z06. The paddle shifts were cool. The people here are nice and helpful. They always make sure you are safe and their cars are safe, but they do let you put the pedal to the floor. Julie was our leader and she was great with directions. She navigated us through las vegas traffic to bring the cars back. If that worries you don't worry only the last tour drives through traffic. Even then the traffic wasn't bad. Steve was our tour guide/caboose and he was awesome. He would pull back a little bit so we could hammer on the shelby. He wasn't far behind just in case it went into the ditch. (Thankfully it didnt) I can't stress enough how fun this was, it was my best thing I've done here. If you drive the shelby be careful. The snake will bite if you aren't careful."
0,"Terrible buffet! Can't believe we paid full price for dinner for two. There was nothing that tasted good, the only positive was the free wine and champagne but still not worth the money. So disappointed! Would have been happier grabbing a cheap slice of pizza"
0,"Terrible. Don't waste your money or time.\nWe were going to have dinner here, but trying to place a reservation well in advance gave a big thumbs down to our group of 14.\nWe ended up eating elsewhere at Tempe Marketplace and then went to the ranch.  The drinks were expensive by AZ standards and weren't right half the time, in addition to being pretty weak.  Place was pretty busy and a good amount of potential for a good night out.  Then about midnight they started throwing people out left and right.  We were celebrating a birthday and the birthday boy brushed up a against a \""security\"" person and was ejected.  I've been going out a long time and have never seen anything like it.  They told the rest of group we could stay.  Ohhh, OK, you just tossed the guest of honor.  Then seeing other people being \""profiled\"" and tossed out...really weird...\nWe won't be back, ever."
0,"Cute decor.  Nice idea.  But, in truth, the yogurt is not that good...something is just not right...I see a lot of people complain about the watering down of the product and that might be why.  I think there is no way having all these public hands come into a place and touch all the machines is going to result in a germ free experience.  I don't think I'll go back, sorry."
0,"I'm struggling with writing this review, as sometimes individual dishes here can be quite good. I've had the buffet here 4 times, and each time there have been issues. Today was no different. I'm a big fan of rasam, the spicy South Indian soup, and, while the rasam here is delicious, it's never, ever hot. Again today, lukeworm soup. Last time I complained, but today I thought \""why bother?\"", as it appears they didn't learn anything from the last time. When I went to dish it out, there were no soup cups or bowls there, only the little saucers that they serve their chutney and pickles in, and teacups for the nonexistent chai. When I asked the woman there for a larger bowl, she went to the kitchen and brought some out, but the owner, who was overseeing this exchange in his micro-managey way, stopped her and then brought me one of these little saucers to serve myself some soup in. Really, it's like a thimbleful. So ok, annoying, but not a deal breaker. On the buffet there is a meat section and a vegetarian section, and there are always interesting dishes available that you might not find at other Indian restaurants. Today they had goat curry and chicken biryani. I like their goat curry, but the chicken biryani was too spicy. I also don't really like meat in a stew to be served on the bone, and both of these were...it's just too damn hard to eat. I like spicy food, but they go overboard with the cayenne here. I'm seeing from some of the other reviews that this chef is from Tamarind, and now I understand, as Tamarind uses too much cayenne also. Better Indian chefs rely less on cayenne and more on fresh green chiles and an array of dried chiles to spice their food. It shows a lack of creativity and subtlety that this guy just dumps cayenne all over everything. Lots of the dishes have this problem, even the toor dal, which should never be hot...you lose all of the other delicious flavors. There was a Northern Indian veggie dish on the buffet today that would have been good but for the overwhelming preponderence of garam masala, which effectively wiped out the taste of every other ingredient in the stew. The one bright spot on the buffet today was a delicious vegetable upma. Upma is a sort of cereal made with rava or semolina, often eaten for breakfast in Southern India. When it shows up on a buffet, it says comfort food to me, and this one was good; flecked with whole cumin and mustard seeds, with broccoli and carrots that were done to perfection. But for that I might have gone hungry. The folks from Tamarind also took over one of the only other good Indian restaurants in the area when they bought the place in Cranberry. I can't remember the name of it then, but now it's Taste of India. It was a great restaurant before they bought it...now the food is like at all of their other restaurants. If you do go to Mintt, don't show up just as they open. They'll let you in the door, but then ask you to wait while they finish setting up the buffet. That chai tea never did make an appearance today, so they're not ready for business when they open their doors. None of these things alone would stop me from going there, but, taken all together, they equal a very poor dining experience. One of the reviewers here mentioned that the Indian food scene here in Pittburgh has been rather spotty. I'd say it still is."
1,"My review is for the Baby Doll Lounge only, which (of all the many bars I visited in Vegas) was the only spot on the strip where I didn't feel surrounded by the cast of Jersey Shore."

0,"I went here the other day to help my friend find a wedding dress. When we first got there we checked in and then were told that our helper (can't remember her name) was finishing up with some other clients and to take a look around. We were told to flip the dresses that we wanted outward instead of taking them out ourselves. We walked around for nearly 15 minutes after the appointment was booked.\n\nFinally the helper came over...but by this time someone had put some of the dresses back to normal because obviously on a Sunday we weren't the only ladies there. So that was frustrating. \n\nNext, it turned out they had barely any dresses in her size - what kind of bridal store doesn't carry a good range of dress sizes (she is not unsually small or large)? I surely didn't expect that. She pulled one dress for my friend to try on...which she ended up not liking (not their fault, of course).\n\nThen our helper dissapeared for 20 minutes. Because she had only pulled one dress we were just standing around. She had, I believe, more than 2 brides booked, which is silly because this is for their special day, you should make your customers feel good and that you appreciate them. I finally had to go tell a manager because I couldn't even find the helper in the store. \n\nThe good thing here is that the manager came over herself, with the helper, and helped to pull dresses - THIS is why they get 2 stars instead of 1 because at least she tried to help the situation and listened to my concerns. \n\nHowever, even despite my friend showing her photos of what she was interested in (the poufy type fairy tale dress that is very common) she kept pulling dresses that were SO OFF of what she wanted. She didn't make the bride or any of the rest of us feel good about shopping there at all.  They also kept showing her dresses WAY above her budget!\n\nSo we left feeling completely unsatisfied. It was nice that the manager tried to fix the situation but it still didn't help. \n\nWe ended up at Adore Bridal boutique, where the consigned dresses are listed by size and she found the perfect dress."
1,It was great. I highly recommend it. Especially garlic butter and filet mignon are perfect.
0,"I could remember Tokyo Expresses were everywhere in the valley.  I loved their food.  I was surprise to see them around and excited to eat the food again.  We entered the place and it smelled like bleach.  STRONG.  It is ok.  We move to the menu and ordering area.  Everyone picked out their meal.  Ordered and sat down.  We got our food pretty quickly.  I got the Katsu Chicken meal (side sui may and drink).  The sauce in the Katsu was kinda of bland.  I remember the sauce was savory.  The sui may, I am sure was the pre-made frozen kind.  I was hungry so I ate it."
1,"This is probably my favorite place that my bf has taken me for our anniversary. \n\nThe service was phenomenal. They knew it was our anniversary and they had rose petals and a card laid out for us on our table. The card read \""thank you for celebrating with us, from the Capital Grill.\"" The server even came up to us and gave us some complimentary sparkling wine for our celebration. I was in awe at how well we were treated. \n\nI ordered the veal and my bf ordered the lamb chops. We opted for creamed spinach and Au gratin potatoes for our sides. \n\nWhile we waited for the food (which was a pretty quick wait) they gave us a complimentary bread assortment which was pretty tasty. \n\nThe food came out and I astonished; It looked so delicious! And boy did it taste even better! Both of our plates were bursting with flavor, and the sides were an awesome compliment. \n\nThe server checked up on us every 10 minutes or so to fill up our glasses and make sure everything was perfect. When we were almost done with our plates he told us to save some room because they had a \""surprise\"" for us. Of course that put a couple big smiles on our faces!\n\nWe were just about done with our food when the server brought out a center cut piece of creme brulee cheesecake with a candle placed right in the middle for us. He said it was on the house from Capital Grill and that they hoped we really enjoyed our anniversary. \n\nMmmm, that cheesecake was sooo delicious! My mouth is drooling just thinking about it!\n\nWe had an exceptional dining experience here. I've never had such incredible service anywhere. I hope they stay the way that they are because we'll be sure to come back very soon!\n\nThank you for making our anniversary so wonderful!"
0,"The buns are number 1, you get to select your favorite cheese, and the service is better than most small restaurants, that is where the praise stops.  What happened to the burgers?  The two of us couldn't put our finger on it, but something was missing. The flavor is no longer what has made this place one of the best burger shoppes in town!  This is the most critical part of Original being one of the best.  This used to be a place I looked forward to enjoy  great food. \n\n     I like to plan before I head to go out to eat, so I checked out the online menu to save time and find all the possibilities for possibly some new choices, not get there and find out the online menu is not the same as the restaurant menu.\nIt is frustrating to peruse an online menu with the result of items not on the literal menu when you get there,  you are in business update your online menu.  Getting there with the expectation to enjoy what is on the online menu and not available is bad business practice, you don't care enough to give your best to your customers.\n\n     No potato salad? That was a signature staple of the establishment,  bad, bad, bad business decision!  And guess what?  it's listed on the online menu, a rude disappointment when you arrive looking for an alternative to fries.\n\n      The decor has not changed in probably near a decade, that is the least of this place's problems, sadly, it matches the food."
0,"This place is over priced for mediocre food. Granted it is on the strip, so it is expected. The fries are pretty tasty, until they get cold. The burgers are tiny patties on a big bun. This place wouldn't stand a chance located anywhere else. My opinion, keep on walking."
0,"OMG, please, please DO NOT go there! I wish I would have read these reviews first.  I called LaTonya about the groupon and she requested I NOT buy it and that she would honor the price (groupon takes half), so I did that.  Stupid me, at least I could have gotten my money back from Groupon.  \nThat is just the short end of this horrible deal.  I told her I wanted NATURAL looking lashes, as mine were already long.  Just wanted some thickness added.  When she was done and gave me the mirror, the disappointment definitely showed on my face.  I looked like some cheap slut!  THICK, THICK BLACK (I am a blonde)  layered eyelashes that were anything but natural.  They immediately started falling off and I made a phone call to her the next day.  She said that was impossible.  I AGAIN  expressed my concern about the damage that these \""falling out\"" lashes would do to mine and she INSISTED that they would grow out with my natural lash in 21 days.  EYELASHES take months to grow back.  The problems continued and after a few days I had already lost (along with my natural lash) over 12 lashes.  I had blank spots along my lash line. I texted her saying I wanted her to remove the lashes because I was concerned with the loss.  She never responded.   I then phoned her on a number that she would not recognize, and of course she answered.  She denied receiving my text.  Anyway, told her I wanted them removed and she refused.  I went to beauty supply and bought dissolvent myself but they were very difficult to remove because she had them soooo layered.  In fact, she told me I was supposed to use the eyebrow brush and \""put\"" them back up into the rat nest she had created when they were hanging in my eye!!\nNeedless to say, I lost well over half of my eyelashes with the removal and have been keeping Walgreens in business with buying artificial ones.  Finally, months later my natural lashes are starting to come back, but nothing like they were.\nShe does not speak the truth, as these lashes that she uses are VERY damaging to your lash and the most UNNATURAL, FAKE lashes ever.  I agree with the other review, they look rat hair.\nThe absolute worst consumer decision I have ever made.  Please don't put yourself through it!!\nShould have walked away when she was an hour late!! ;-("
1,"Wonderful pastries and viennoisseries.  Fresh and authentic French!  One of the best is the Amandine, kind of like a slice of almond croissant bread pudding.  I remembered biting into it and saying, \""Oh my God\"".  It was so fresh and soft and doughy and delicious.  I highly recommend stopping at any one of their patisseries, just to buy that.  Go to the one at Jean Talon marche, if you are planning on going there.  Don't forget Premiere Moisson boulangerie while you are there, also.  Forget about the carbs and enjoy yourself. You won't find pastries and breads like this in the United States.  Otherwise, you have to go to France."
0,"This is a sad excuse for a gay resort.  Sort of like a worn out version of Palm Springs.  We found the Zen Yard up on Maryland Avenue a much more agreeable experience in a better neighborhood as well.  Zen Yard is a far better value, with full breakfasts included and warm, helpful hosts as well, not to mention particularly reasonable off-season rates and hosts who are actually there for their guests."
0,"Horrible customer service! I went in there and there was only one person working and he was talking to another customer. The employee did not acknowledge me at all while I walked around for five minutes and then I left. While walking out the door, the employee said have a nice day. The sad thing is I am a customer looking for R/C car parts and batteries. I guess I won't be purchasing anything from this store."
0,"As far as 'service provider' places go, I'm normally very middle of the road. Partly as I don't expect anything above and beyond the ordinary. Unfortunately, this particular branch of Specsavers has consistently provided me with disappointing, frustrating and occasionaly laughably infuriarting experiences that has led to me consider switching opticians (which is a hassle in itself).\n\nI wear contacts every day. I also need glasses. I've been with Specsavers since I was 17, from Perth to Glasgow and now Edinburgh. This being my closest branch I go here for the contact lense top-ups.\n\nFirst visit, when I first moved to Edinburgh They had to call up the branch in Glasgow to get my prescription, but the phone lines were dead. It took half an hour to work this out. I'm a patient person and know these things happen. I returned the following day and got the prescription transferred but it was a bit of a hassle.\n\nSecond visit, when I went in asking to get a top-up, they asked for my name. After they pulled out \""my\"" record they first of all said my contacts had to be ordered in specially. No, they don't. They really don't. Also, my contact lense check was out of date. Um, no it isn't, it really isn't. Are you sure you have the right file? After 10 minutes of back and forth it turns out they HAD pulled out the wrong file. I was getting quite frustrated by this point as I know my eyes are 'normal' and don't require special lenses, and patiently explained I definitely had had a test recently (they charge \u00a330 a pop for that). The staff weren't apologetic, but I felt more as though they were laughing at my frustration.\n\nThird visit, just this week. They're out of stock of my lenses. Ummmm ok (that's never happened before.) By the looks of the shelf they were out of a lot of stock. I was told they could order more in for me - perfect. But as I went to leave the sales assistant said \""oh but you need to pay now\"" with a tone of 'well duh\"" despite that he hadn't implied this at first. I asked 'are you not just getting in a large order soon?\"" and he, again in the same tone, said that these would be put aside for me. I had no problem with paying in advance (I pay either way). It was his attitude of acting like I was dumb for not realising this, and also expecting me to just *know* this. \n\nSo currently I am contact-lense-less and a bit pee'd off. This branch has had three strikes and I'm just about out. Every time I've been in something has gone wrong, and it's not been dealt with well. I'm patient, I understand nothing is perfect all the time, but it's a matter of how you deal or handle the less-than-perfect situations. In this instance, this branch has dealt with it badly every time. I'll be picking up my contacts when they come in then consider looking elsewhere."

0,These guys will outright lie to you about the games you are buying to make a sale.  Do not shop here.
0,Not a professional run business.  Owner is unreliable and did not follow thru for us when we booked him for a day long trip. coach bus is very old and odor coming from bathroom makes it very difficult to sit in back of bus.    Bus had mechanical issues and owner did not seem to care when he could not follow thru with what he promised and too late to hire another company...
0,I live in walking distance but I still skip it due to the poor service. They have plenty of staff but they are unsupervised and not very attentive. I had two visits in a row where I was seated and forgotten. I usually have to walk to the bar to get service. The food is fine if you can get the staff to serve it. One final note they do not take discover if that is your card of choice.
0,"We went to Kobe last night and although it was dead, service was bad -- it took the waitress forever to get to our table with simple things like water and ice tea.  We ordered salads, sushi and a couple rolls -- sushi was supermarket fresh: didnt smell like fish yet, but looked stale.  Also ordered scallop sushi, instead they brought us yum yum scallop. Although it didnt say it on the menu that the scallop will come like that, when we complained the waitress said -- thats how they make is here.  Salads -- Tuna Poke and Screaming Orgasm were ok, nothing special, just ok.  The rolls were the worst.  We needed a magnifying glass to find eel in a caterpillar roll, same was for the yum yum roll, they were both crabmeat and cucumber.  Same goes for \""me so horny roll\"" and \""grand canyon roll\"".  I understand thye want to save money, but people wont come back if you dont put raw fish in sushi!"
0,"I cannot understand why every restaurant was closed at 7:30pm ? I landed 15 minutes later than expected, dying for a drink somewhere and something to munch on while I waited for a colleague of mine to land 45 minutes later. I walked all over the terminal. Both floors. EVERYTHING except a little news stand was closed. At 7:30? that is unheard of. Nothing to see, nothing to do. Some of the worst airport food I've seen. Even the Starbucks didn't have fruit. Meh."
1,"First off, glad to see someone move into the Gold Spot building!! Got my husband to come and try Pita Jungle, even though he says no the Greek food.... The building is done up nicely, with a great outdoor patio area. The beers on draft are first rate, and the happy hour tapas menu (all for $1 !!) is great for chatting and sharing. \nWe ordered wayyyy too much, as the plates are very large. We shared the Greek salad, fresh and tasty. Husband had the Phillie Pita... huge, and hot, tasty and given a good review by him, with a \""I could do this again\"". I had the Tuna Pita. It was great, but I thought it was tuna in a pita, and it was greens with tuna on top with a pita on the side. Was great, but huge!! Then we shared two of the one dollar tapas plates, the falafal and the hummus trio. Both good... \nService was wonderful, and the whole experience was good. Glad to have them in the hood, a new place to ride our bikes or scooters to!!"
1,We have not been at this Applebee's in quite some time and stopped in after leaving another local restaurant after not getting any service after 10 minutes of waiting.\n\nAnyway.......it was great and I wanted to mention on nice our server was.  Roxie rocked and we always had everything we wanted and right on time.  It's always great to write about great service and food.  \n\nWe'll be back.
1,"Fitness Experience is great!  The trainers are very knowledgeable and always willing to answer any questions I have.  My personal training sessions have really brought my workouts to the next level.  I get a program specifically designed for me, follow it for a bit, and then when I'm ready for a new challenge I meet with my trainer, Sunny, for another program.  \n\nThe gym is not over crowded like some of the big chain gyms that I've been too.  I can always get on the equipment that I want.  It's a small enough size that you get to know the trainers and other members on a first name basis, but it's big enough to have all the equipment you need."
0,"Was a bit skeptical having lunch here because of all the negative reviews, but we came based on my cousin's recommendation who lives in Vegas and has eaten here numerous time.\n\nThe positives:\n+ Food came out very fast.  We were very hungry, so this was a bonus.\n+ Food was tasty.  We had: beef chow fun, kung pao chicken, roast duck, roast pork, scallops with vegetables, choi sum, fried calamari. \n\nThe negatives:\n- Cash only. \n- Extremely RUDE service.  Staff was more interested in eating their own lunch than taking our order of filling our water cups.  Actually, they never filled our water cups, just plopped a pitcher of water on our table and walked away.  As a matter of fact, that's how all of our dishes were delivered - server just dropping the dish on our table and walking away.  Never asked us how we were doing or if we needed anything.  Also forgot to give us the rice we ordered - had to remind the waiter.  Only made an attempt at being pleasant when it was time to deliver the bill.\n\nWon't be going out of our way to eat here again."
0,out of business -- confirmed last night
1,I enjoy the food here but the atmosphere is kind of blah. Usually get the yellow curry or pad thai.
0,"My husband and I went in on a Sunday afternoon because we both heard so much about the Melting Pot. To be fair, going in we read how we would be boiling our food and we were skeptical right then but gave it a shot. We walked in and there was a blonde hostess that was incredibly rude. She looked at us when we came in and didn't say one word. I was standing literally right in front of her and she never had the decency to say, \""welcome to ...\"" I've worked a long time in the restaurant field, I know what is required and this girl should not be working around people. She continued to ignore us and took some people to their table and another hostess came and we told her we have a reservation. She was sweet, just how a hostess should be. \nOur server was awesome that's why I'm giving this 2 stars instead of 1, I can't remember her name but she was very friendly. \nWe ordered cheddar fondue and when we tasted it, there was just something lacking to the taste, it was very bland. The salads came out tasty, but the entrees, my husband got the steak lovers, I got the shrimp, chicken, and steak. \nOur server told us to keep the food in the pot for 2 minutes and that's more than enough, shrimp 1 min 30 sec.. The chicken was not finished at 2 minutes it actually took 4 minutes, which I have no problem waiting longer but if that happened to someone who doesn't know, they could have gotten sick.. \nThe shrimp looked and smelled awful.. My husband tried some and he has a high tolerance for food, and he could not eat the shrimp because of how bad the taste was. \nThe only good thing we had was the s'mores chocolate. That was amazing if you like chocolate. So go for dessert, but eat dinner somewhere else."
0,"This is for the pizza to go portion of the restaurant.\n\nThe pizzas are supposed to be a quick gourmet pizza, so don't expect to find your typical toppings aside from just pepperoni. There were maybe 4-5 options. The pizzas themselves were just meh. The crust was not that thin and crunchy. For a better late night pizza, secret pizza at the Cosmo is a much better option. Also, the line moves sooo slow."
0,"Sorry, little grey heads, Mia Bella Cafe is just Meh for me and not the 5-star experience that everyone else seemed to enjoy (did you?). Came in around 11:15am and the spot was empty. Like, 0 people in there. 0. I was aiming for a light meal, but there were signs for shawarma outside and I'm weak for the stuff, so I went for a shawarma wrap with a side of potato salad and then grabbed a turkey panini to eat later in the day. \n\nI'll make this quick bc it's Friday and I know you gots some partying to do... the wrap wasn't cut, so I had a shawarma burrito that was eh. I was confused the entire time on whether it was OK or not. The potato salad consisted of diced potatoes, but no mayo to tie 'em together. So, yea, just a bunch of dry potatoes. The panini was OK. Turkey, cheese, let, tom on some nice bread.... but they put it in a box with an Israeli salad which leaked all over it, making the bread soggy as hell and an open-faced panini for moi. Overall, meh. I wouldn't return."
0,"Horrible customer service! I will not return! If I could give this place zero stars, I would!"
1,"One our favorites and I can't believe I forgot to review this place for this long. We eat at Chino Bandido every time we're in the area and my entire family loves it.\n\nI always get the Jade Chicken and switch up the other item along with jerk fried rice and refried beans. Always fresh and delicious. Only complaint is the menu is a bit confusing the first couple of times you fill it out but once you have it down it makes sense.\n\nHighly recommended, try it and you'll love it.\n\nHint: if it is your first time they have a sample station and just ask to try the items before you order."
1,"Returned our call moments after calling after 7 at night upon discovery that our refrigerator was not cooling. Began diagnosing problem over the phone, let us know what steps we could take to preserve what was not ruined. Very polite helpful and understanding. After the tech came out to fully diagnosis the problem we called back within less than a half hour with a quote on the price of repair. Customer service was very honest and helpful in letting us know that it was not an appliance worth repairing. They even went above and beyond by answering general questions to help us move forward in our decision on what refrigerator to purchase. Thank you for your prompt, knowledgable, friendly customer service."
1,Their salad is my favorite! Mmmmmmm...
1,"Dr. Conway is a very competent chiropractor. I've been seeing him about 2 years now and he asks a lot of questions about my workouts, injuries, etc. to figure out exactly what needs adjusting. He takes his time, uses different techniques (as needed), and makes practical recommendations to improve my condition. His prices are reasonable. The only reason I'm not giving him 5 stars is because I wish he had early morning hours so I could pop in after the gym. :) I definitely recommend Dr. Conway!"
0,"Firstly, they do not allow their special as a take out, so as a working woman who does not have time to sit at a restaurant for lunch, I don't get to enjoy the specials? Maybe I don't get out much but that was definitely a first. So I place an order for delivery and what arrived was not what I ordered,  despite the fact that the delivery guy checked and assured me the order was correct. I asked for a wheat bun and did not get one, they say their burgers come with lettuce, pickles, onions, tomatoes, and a sauce, my \""burger\"" was a wet bun, a pattie and some cheese (mainly stuck to the foil and paper wrapper. Then to top it all off, the fries were stale, like leftover reheated fries and were not edible in my opinion. This was my first and will be my LAST meal at Burger Rush, what you get is definitely NOT worth what you pay for!! TERRIBLE!!"
1,"Deliciousness! Fresh ingredients, awesome atmosphere, fun decor, and great service. When you order a coffee based drink it comes with complimentary coffee-art!"
0,"Something about this particular Applebee's is off-putting. The food wasn't as good as others, the interior wasn't as inviting and like others, the waiters would all meet up at the bar and talk to each other until someone walked in to be seated.\n\nWould be ideal if they moved out and they were replaced. Will try to avoid it."
1,"Not very good service, but pretty good sushi. They didn't even greet us when we walked in/ up to the counter and our server was just okay. But it was very good, and the food came out quickly. I would still go back, but I have others closer, cheaper, with just as good sushi."
0,"Poor communication from the management. They are quick to remind you of your rent due but when it comes to notifying you of the construction schedule, they do not notify you ahead of time. For the last 2 weeks, there has been jackhammering and pounding noises above me. I work from home and was conducting a teleconference meeting one day when suddenly, loud drilling, pounding, jackhammering noises started to go off above me. Not to mention, my dog started to shiver of fear from all of the construction noises. I have been sending emails to the management office requesting to notify me ahead of time so that I can make arrangements to take myself, my laptop, and my dog to a more quiet area. Nancy, the manager, stated on her first reply of 5 emails I have sent thus far within the last 2 weeks, stated that the construction will only last for a day. Lies! It has been ongoing off and on for 2 weeks now. Also, the pool is still under construction. I moved here in June. No pool!  It is now almost Winter time!  I've only been here for 4 months and I can't wait to move out.  They make you read hundreds of pages of HOA rules, but it's ok for them to violate the noise agreement towards you as a tenant. Had I known I'll get this type of treatment from the management, I would have just moved to a cheap apartment."
1,"I went to see In the Wake of Bounty (part of Fringe Fest 2011) and besides the show being exquisite, the venue was perfect.  Phoenix Little Theatre is basically attached to the Phoenix Art Museum which means you can stroll about in the little park area before the show. Take goofy pictures with the headless children statues and throw wishing pennies into the fountain overlooked by the uber masculine yet pensive sculpture.  \n\n\nFree and plentiful parking!!!  The theatre is really intimate with a small stage and limited seating. With that being said... any seat would give a great view of the happenings on stage.  Only downside is that the theatre chairs and my rear end did not get along amiably.  Lots of fidgeting on my part and constant readjusting."
0,"Frozen margarita was sub-par, a bit weak.  I had ground beef taco, tostada and rice and wasn't impressed with any of it.  It wasn't bad, just not memorable to the point where I will not feel the need to return.\nStaff is very friendly and the atmosphere is clean."
0,I don't understand why anyone likes this place.  I ordered the fresh pasta and found it heavy and tasteless.   It is also very expensive considering for what I paid here I can dine in much better places.  I find the Food Network sign on the outside a little tasteless also.
0,Takes about 20 minutes to check bag....if you want a deal...go through southwest. Absolute headache.
0,"Update: Remember the friend thand had eaten the food with a fly? Well, today his wife just told me he has been going to the bathroom all day. I think he got food poison? They're going to be reported to the Department of Health, Chandler City, and BBB.\n\n--------\n\nWe always eat here when we crave Saigon Pho. Today was the last we eat here. Here's why .\n\nWe ate with 2 other families. One of the families got their order wrong. Instead of apologizing,  the server kept pointing at the menu telling them that they got what they ordered. Then, my friend found a dead fly in his food. Disappointed friend talked to another  server about it. You know what the server said instead of simply apologizing?  She said \""you sit by the door so the fly must have gotten in and on your food.\"" My friend's wife said that the fly was already under the food.  Server replied, \""no, no, no, no!\"" She should have just apoligized so they could have moved on. They even had the audacity to charge them for the plate with the dead fly. My friends paid for it anyways. I could tell that they were trying to get rid of us. The other server gave our check even though we were still eating. He kept coming back for it thinking I would put my card on the bill. Later,  I see a server putting a shaved ice desert on our table. We didn't accept it. My friend said the damage has been done. All they needed was an apology,  but instead, the rude server kept on with her attitude.  Finally, the couple asked for the number of their manager. Rude server was upset. These people need to learn about customer service and ethics. I never make reviews.  When I do, it's  something everyone has to know about."
0,"Walking through all of that construction.  Areas that should have been blocked off by the casino, we're open and we ended up near very dirty areas that were quite dangerous. No signs with directions to where you're going. \n\nNow to Hash House A Go Go. I'm not sure if the food is good or not, and I'm bummed with the experience i received here. LOUD music that was a bit much. People were watching football and you couldn't even hear them cheering. The bitch calling out reservations on the loud speaker, was way too damn loud. So if you're hearing impaired or like that noise, try it out. The staff is obviously ill mannered and lack education, and definitely don't understand customer service.  They stood around the host desk, singing and dancing and ignoring customers coming up to make reservations. \n\nOh and did I mention that it smells like a club. The cigarette smoke was gross. \n\nEnjoy!"
0,"So, I decided to get sum china food today!!! Umm i got spicy orange chicken n fried rice...... I'm not very happy with the chicken I thought it was going to be crunchy with sum spicy sauce but it's not.... In that case I should of went to Panda Express for realz!!!! Not as great as everyone in here says it is!!!! I don't like the taste,"
0,"Just got back home from here.......yup!  That's the best I can say about this place!  I made it out alive.....OK maybe that's a stretch but truly, eaters beware!  If you love poor quality canadianized Chinese food, this is your spot.  The food was mostly soggy, MSG-ed and was very limited in choice for your $18 (counted approx 24 items on the hot course buffet).  We had to wait around empty pans hoping someone would come out with something that was at least hot, and fresh enough to not have gone soggy from the copious amonts of oil being used here.  Having voiced all these complaints, the chicken wings were by far the very best thing on the buffet, the rice and chicken goo guy enjoyable, the rest won't make you sick but nothing you'll want to do again soon.\nWe ate here 10 years ago, it was exactly the same, I guess we figured that to still be in business after that long improvements must have been made...Nope!\nThe drinks were varied, interesting, delicious and fairly priced for their size, if you are ordering 'virgins' for the kids....VERY PRICEY!  They only take off $2 per drink, I should have told them to charge me the total and bring me the alcohol....the $6 I saved would have gotten me a pretty stiff drink! \nWe won't be back, unless of course we get a burning need to feed some of the 40+ turtles they have in their fountains!"
0,"I've given Evo Cafe far more chances than it deserves. The food is hardly considered passable. The last time I was here, there was a piece of metal in my food. The bubble tea is alright, but most of them are made from powder anyway. The only things that are probably keeping this place going are the prime location and wide menu selection."
1,"Having now purchased two wedding rings from Rock Candy, I think I can vouch for the experience.\n\nThe staff have always been helpful and, when shopping with the Fussiest Man In The World (should I take that as a compliment?), patient, helpful staff are a wonderful thing.\n\nRock Candy have a great selection of more unusual designs and I like the variety they have for men.  I'm as much of a cufflink addict as Him, so this place is somewhere we can both ogle and consider joint purchases, as much as point at things with a big Hint gesture in the months leading up to birthdays, Christmas and other Significant Events.\n\nOddly, I also really like the design of the space in Rock Candy.  It's a little conversion art gallery meets jewellery store, with considered lighting and an air of down-to-earth elegance.  \n\nIt is, however, the staff who really make Rock Candy more than \""just\"" another trinket store.  Only days after ordering a smaller wedding ring, we got to go back in and try it on...we didn't bother with the big white dress, though!"
1,"I thought the food and service here was splendid!  We had sea bass and lamb chops.  The olive tapenade and homemade breadsticks were a nice accompaniment to our meal.  I actually had to use my phone to google some of the menu items, who knew that sea bass is also called Branzini?  \n\nThe food was delicious I just wished we had a more private seating arrangement. The ambiance of our seating was lousy, as there was a table with young children nearby (for 8 pm Saturday dinner), and loud party girls chanting over shots at the nearby bar rail.  Also we were seated next to a corner so lots of people were hurrying around.  Despite that, the service was great and the food was thoroughly enjoyed."
1,"Went here for a smog check. Fast, friendly and smog check special discounted at $15.95."
1,"We were going around checking out different shops to determine where to buy a new vape kit. With a few more shops we wanted to visit it was decided that this would be the place. A large glass counter with many sections has the different types of kits and accessories. A very helpful staff who offered his opinions and suggestions took good care of is, Benny was his name. After my wife picked out her kit Eric at the juice bar let her sample all the flavors she wanted. We sat and talked for a while and the whole staff is very polite and outgoing. We live clear across town but will be back here for all of our Vape needs."
1,"Best steakhouse in Charlotte! The steaks are so tender & juicy there is no substitute for that beef. I'm also very impressed with chefs that know how to cook a steak to order, every time. We have never been disappointed with anything we've ordered, entrees to side dishes or deserts. Its all high quality food and super delicious. Whenever my husband and I get to treat ourselves we always choose Morton's, we love it!"
0,Had a bug in my sake and they did not even care! Saryah was our waitress and although attentive not friendly nor apologetic about the visitor in my drink.... will I go back probably not....2 stars cause the food was good...too bad the service was NOT
0,"Thought the repairs would be $160-170 for a belt and motor bolts. Turned out to be $1600-1700. Apparently this is a normal price, but they could have at least been clear and concise when telling me the price. Avoiding Midas from now on."
1,"C'est chic!\n\nI loved this place. Not only for its interior and exterior decorating! The prices are very reasonable and it's not too far from the strip. It's very clean, the staff is very helpful, and the ammenities are great!\n\nAvoid at all costs for these reasons:\n1. The DJ starts playing at the pool starting 11am; so if you have a bad hangover, this would inconvenience you. Not a problem for me though, I don't sleep in that late.\n\n2. Valet ONLY. It gets annoying have to tip the guy every time you want to go out and need them to get your car just to go a few blocks out. We were better off just getting a taxi.\n\nWILL DEFINITELY COME BACK!"
0,I would give this place 0 Stars if I could and I'll tell you why. This place has a female cashier that is extremely rude with ZERO customer service skills. Now this just doesn't fall on her but also on the management for not training their employees to be friendly and courteous. I have been to this place atleast a good 20  times in past 6 months and every time I had to deal with her at the counter my experience was horrible. On some of those visits my gf was with me and she noticed the same thing. BTW talking to a dog owner while you have 10 people waiting in line to check out is not considered customer service. At times she wont greet people or even say thank you. At Least that was my experience. This particular Petsmart need to do a better job at training their employees. I've been to several of Petsmart location and always found good helpful employees always going out of there way to help you. Hopefully someone from Petsmart corporate reads this review and fixes this problem. Im sure they are losing customers just because of this one person. I can handle anything but not rude people specially when I'm spending my money at that business.
0,"Beanscene should be one of the best places in Edinburgh city centre to catch up with friends. It has live music several nights a week, a great central location and offers comfort food such as nachos and pizza to go with your coffee or smoothie.\n\nUnfortunately, it doesn't quite live up to what you'd expect. Unless you want greasy fast food then it's not a great place to go for lunch or dinner. If it's a coffee you're after, you'll get much better value for money across the street in The Grind House or even Starbucks. Likewise, if it's a live music venue you're after then there are plenty more in Edinburgh that aren't quite so cramped and chaotic.\n\nBasically, by trying to be too many things at once it ends up being neither. It's clean, staff are generally friendly and pleasant and it is in a good location, but still it just doesn't quite work."
1,So I bought a Groupon for Bally's Steakhouse cause I was staying at Bally's. I called to make the reservation and the guy was really nice and helpful. When I got there I gave them the groupon and the host seated us they gave the server our groupon and everything was good. It very nice and classy looking place each table had a rose on it and the arrangement is nice. It did feel a little bit old to me the look and such. \n\nThere bread basket had many different kinds of bread and they were all good. The salad was normal. I order the 16oz prime rib and it was to die for. It was very good and yummy and just right. I would rate it the same level as Lawry's The Prime Rib place that also good. The meal was good we also had the lobster roll thing and it was good as well.\n\nOverall the meal and such was very good and I had no problem using my Groupon and the server was very nice.
1,"Love this place, it has the best potato cheese soup ever. And Erin that works the register was so sweet, she made sure I got the last bread bowl. The chocolate croissants are wicked good,"
1,"There pizza is some of the best around, when I think of a sit in pizza place i think of them! I have yet to have a bad pizza I will say sometimes the service is slow due to them being busy. I have had there wings and they are average nothing amazing but deep dish pizza and there cheese bread will make your mouth water!"
1,Similar to feativals in other parts of the country but better weather. Purchasing directly from artist or artisan gives more meaning. Some artists look like their work.
1,"In a gorgeous new part of Vegas! Lots of standard beers, a few unknowns but not too many. Service was great. The outside patio was beautiful and very clean. The food was pretty tasty and the beer was also very good. I had a chocolate shake porter on nitro and it was out of this world. Will definitely be back again."
0,"I FUCKING LOVE PIZZA! The end.\n\nI try things over and over, sometimes when they suck too. Same is the case here. I keep trying this pizza and eveytime I just don't like it. I don't know what it is. \n\nSauce = Bland\n\nCrust = Bland and did not pass the NY fold test, full on Tip Drip!!\n\nTruly they're better places than this in AZ. I don't want to mention them in this article but 3 or 4 come to mind. \n\n P.S. This time when I tried the pizza I was swimming laps outside.....in the heat..... That makes me soooo hungry. Our friends ordered it and thats why I had it again. As hungry as I was I still no likey!!!"
1,"Never had the food from the truck, just heard from Studio 21 that these portable burger masters were opening a brick and mortar, and with nothing else new to try on a Sunday, grabbed some homies and off we went.\n\nCons: Hard to find late at night. Telephone number MIA.\n\nPros: Great food. Sliders are all very unique and well thought out (my friends got all of them and I got to try them all.) Vegetarian for the veggies makes them happy. Fries are also awesome. Beverages in glass bottles. \n\nThe decor itself is amazing, but it kind of gave me the \""you're not cool enough to eat here Mr. 30+ year old\"" vibe, but the staff was awesome and quashed that immediately. The guy at the counter fist bumped me as I walked in. Good dudes. \n\nThere's something to be said at the customer service that comes from friendly people who like their jobs vs the standard corporate customer service that comes from fear of reprimand.\n\nWill eat here again, will totally recommend to my friends. This is the perfect place for anyone who says Vegas has no personality or culture of it's own, and this is probably the unparalleled champion of \""Oh s--- it's late we're drunk and hungry where do we go?\""\n\nAnd as a bonus the NBA Jam machine is set on free. What else could you want?*\n\n\n*The MK2 Machine up and running, that's what!"
1,Went here a while back great place great staff met the owner nice people.  Alot of variety interesting choices. I Would recommend if you are in the area.
1,"I live around the corner from SGC, but will drive right by it to get to this great shop. Why? Customer service and taking the time to care about ALL customers. The manager says hello to everyone who walks in the door (male or female are treated equally--NICE!) and someone always takes the time to explain the purchase and never up-sell. \n\nSmall and friendly is how to run a business! Avoid the flashy over-priced places and go to Bear Arms, you won't regret it."
1,"1. Pillows aren't that bad, not sure what everyone uses at home but I've had way worse. I have a tempur-pedicure at home so you know I'm picky about pillows.\n\n2. The whole pet issue - you are in Vegas why the hell are you brining your pet?! I could understand if you were road tripping it but honestly I don't think you are. It's called a pet sitter check into it, plus leaving your pet in a room all day while you party it up isn't cool. Your pet doesn't need to go everywhere with you, we left ours behind. \n\n3. We only had hot scalding water in our shower, huge problem which is why I gave 4 stars. Called and asked for it to be fixed and it was in a very reasonable amount of time. Politeness counts, remember that. \n\n4. Noise, as far as that goes the a/c hums but that's it. I'm a really light sleeper and so far I don't see there being any issues. \n\n5. The person who complained about closet space should have opened the other side. Surprise it's full length and had an iron and ironing board. The smaller side has a safe, which is always a plus. My dress is hanging just fine and is wrinkle free.\n\n6. Mini bar, they are always over priced. If you don't want to spend $6 on water then bring your own. But if you have ever been to a hotel before in your life you should know this. Complaint denied. \n\n7. Entrance isn't hard to find, it's right next to the Mandalay Bay entrance in the parking garage. There is also a sign that says Delano.\n\n\nThis is our first night out of 3, so far it's been really nice. The only bad thing is the weather, it's raining with thunderstorms but the hotel can't control that."
0,"Decided to try some new pizza last night and we now wish that we had stuck with our usuals.  Ordered delivery for a cheese pizza with half sausage.  The delivery was super fast, like 25 minutes but I wasn't happy with the results.  First of all, the delivery driver didn't have any change on him so that was annoying.  Then I looked at the pizza and it looked half cooked.  I like my pizza well done and this pizza wasn't even done!  The mozz. wasn't even fully melted in some places.  The sliced sausage was yucky too, it had a rubbery texture to it.  I don't recommend this pizza, it's bunk."
0,So I went back to Charr after my initial visit to take the boyfriend in. What man doesn't love a burger?! Well he loved it....until he found a hair in the meat. I hope for their sake this was a one-time thing but we haven't been back since.\n\nBummer because I like supporting local places but it was one hair too many.
1,"on a last minute happy hour invitation, the wife and i rode our bikes to the handlebar to meet some friends. it's right off mill and i've walked right past it unfortunately several times. \n\nwe were seated right away and given a run-down of some of their beer specials. i'm not sure who he was, but he was very intense and passionate about the beer selection and i very much appreciated that. my beer was served promptly as was my wifes glass of wine. we then received another server whom took the remainder of our happy hour and food orders. \n\nwe split the only vegetarian option on the menu, the portobello burger. it was huge! and delicious, albeit a little pricey at 10 bucks and the fries were extra. the happy hour drink specials more than made up for it. she kept our water glasses filled so we wouldn't be sloshing drunk riding our bikes home in the dark through papago park. \n\nthe interior is very clean, rustic/modern with a huge bar, and plenty of patio seating which i hear allows dogs. my wife griped about the sink being outside the bathroom-\""since girls like to primp\"" and thought it wouldn't be prudent to check nose hairs in full view of everyone else. me? i just like to wash my hands. \n\na cool spot that wasn't filled with college kids, and had a great selection of beers! hope to go back soon!"
0,"Went there for lunch on July 12 on the 2 for 1 the hotel gave us.  Pizza was ok and ribs were pretty good.  Other than that nothing stood out.  Many things were edible, but not a lot of flavor including the pasta bar where they make it for you.  Go elsewhere this one is a dud!"
1,Close to airport and nice rooms what more could you ask for?  What also is convenient is the courtesy shuttle to the strip.\n\nNothing bad to write about this place.
0,"It's closed. For the entire summer. They're claiming renovations, but that is way lame."
1,"La Mexicana is an upgraded version of the street vendors.  Good healthy food, prepared home style, this is the real deal.  \n\nThere is nothing pretentious about La Mexicana, including owner Roberto who sports a soul patch and perfect English.  The walls are decorated with memorabilia and the tables are large, solid and sturdy.  \n\nWhat makes La Mexicana worth the trip is the food.  It's made fresh daily in the small kitchen.  There are 3 kinds of chili (what we gringos call salsa) 2 red and 1 verde each with a distinct flavor.  \n\nThe carne asada is is grilled, thinly cut and goes well in the ample burritos filled with rice, beans and fresh cilantro.  \n\nThe chili verde, chucks of pork in a nice tasty brown sauce are equally at home as a stand alone dish over rice with beans and salad on the side or stuffed into a burrito, enchilada or taco.  \n\nLa Mex is about as authentic as it gets.  A working persons cafe, it is always filled with locals on a break from work, holding meetings or watching the huge TV that dominates the corner playing \""futbol' or Telenovelas or the latest musical offerings live from Mexico City. \n\nLa Mexican is a Vegas local's hidden treasure."
0,"I'm sad that my favorite club in Vegas has noticeably went down a notch. The hip hop room is always closed (the last 3 times I went over the past 6 months, the room was closed!). My friend even called to ask if the hip hop room would be open, and they said yes. This was a lie! It was closed yet again! \n\nThey also played Justin Bieber. :( more sadness all around."
0,"The good:\nThree stars because the layout of our two bedroom apartment was perfect-high ceilings, large windows and plenty of storage space. \n\nLocation- it's central. 10-15 minutes away from everything.\n\nThe Bad:\nThe office staff - always rude and bitchy. It seems that they try to screw you over any chance they get. \nMaintenance - if the office staff actually tell them that we needed something fixed they would be on time.\nSafety - seems like the police are always here. Either for domestic abuse or break ins. There are cars always waiting to get into the gates at night. \nNoise - since our unit was close to the free way we always heard cars and people getting pulled over. We were told there was a $75 noise violation fee when we moved in. I guess they didn't tell our other neighbors that. At one point we heard Mexican music playing the whole day for about a week. We called the office it seemed like they didn't say anything since the music kept on going. There was also an annoying dog barking all the time!!!\n\nThe unit itself was amazing. Office staff are seedy at best. If you can put up with the staff and know how to shoot a gun then go for it."
1,"Charming. Quaint. Fun. Delicious.\n\nAll of these words can be used to describe Chicago Joe's. Well it's a homey, no-frills, Italian restaurant located in what used to be a small house in downtown Las Vegas - so what is there not to like?\n\nI had the lovely experience of joining a large group for a pre-set meal at Chicago Joes. Although we did get some choices of what we would like. From the wine to the home made cannoli, I must say Chicago Joes, you've impressed me.\n\nThey did start us out with their bread sticks, however they weren't really the consistency I tend to enjoy. None the less, with balsamic and oil to dip them in they were a lovely treat! Next came the salad, a bit small and only iceberg lettuce. However, the house dressing made up for the lack of more leafy greens. \n\nI opted for the RED marinara, clam sauce spaghetti. I am so glad I went with this choice because it was absolutely delicious. Out of everything I ate here, it was the star. I couldn't believe clams could be do delicious!\n\nIf you want some very down-to-earth, no-frills, straight-up like an old Italian Grandma would make it food, then you better get to Joe's!"
1,"This place is always a hit. Even when you don't know what you want, they will help you decide. The baristas always have great recommendations. Often times I tell them what I am in the mood for, often times I let them know I love Nutella, and they give me suggestions. They also will make just about anything on the menu and mix it up for ya! This past time they mixed up a mocha freezeacino with nutella. Pretty darn good, tasted less watered down than sbux.\n\nI have gotten a S'mores coffee (not that great) but you know what? Its the thought that counts, what other coffee shop has a drive thru, local bakery items, friendly and helpful baristas that dont rush you in ordering, and unique drink ideas? HMM 32 Shea does. \n\nCome here, check out the variety, and the local flavors. You wont be upset that you did.\n\nLocated over on the Northwest Plaza on Shea and 32nd just past the 51 freeway. Go there. Tomorrow morning.."
1,"I came here around 11 pm after a recovery nap from day drinking. As you walk in, you're greeted by a stone buddha on top of a pond with floating lotus flowers. The decor is so cute, and the place is dimly lit. They even play good music - telepopmusik vibes. Super chill atmosphere. \n\nI ordered the spicy seafood noodle soup (medium spicy), which was $22. The portion was huge, and it was loaded with seafood - scallops, shrimp, calamari, fish cakes, and baby octopus. It also had rice noodles, bean sprouts, peanuts, and green onions. Super delish.\n\nMy friend got the northern style shrimp tom yum with a side of jasmine rice, and he loved it. I tasted the soup, and it was very lemongrass-y, just the way I like it. My sister got the duck noodle soup, and she liked it, but thought it was a little too heavy. \n\nThe service was also excellent. Our water was always refilled and our waitress brought sauces and explained each one. I would definitely come back the next time I find myself in sin city."
0,"To give it two stars is being generous.  I don't even feel like reviewing this place.  The only reason we had so much fun being here is because we ignored all the negative stuff and just climbed.\n\nI'll just make this brief.\n\n1.)  It smells like socks and dirty shoes.  The ventilation is not very good and if you're there for hours, maybe you'll just get used to the stench.\n\n2.)  The receptionist was not helpful, condescending, and acted like helping us was too much out of the way.  Probably just got used to regulars and is very nice to them.  But to newbies, forget it.  My cousin is the nicest guy you could ever meet and will even go out of his way to buy food for the poor.  He just wasn't worth the time to be given good service to I think.\n\nI think if the smell wasn't so bad and if service was better I would recommend people to come here or myself to come here to have fun."
0,"I've wandered into the Trailhead a handful of times,  mostly to check out the food offerings and vaguely consider researching a bike in a locally owned shop.  \n\nFirst:  the food.    I got a salad with a sandwich, and while the sandwich was nothing to write home about, and the salad itself was redolent of red onion that had been taken off, the dressing was freaking delicious.   I think they load it up with paprika and some sort of honey mustard.   Not really anything I'd have ever tried otherwise, and that was fantastic.     The food is meh.   The pastries are substandard.  The service is slow, the guys that have been behind the counter are completely anti social unless you're a hipster or a bike nerd. I'm not ragging on either of you groups; but I fit squarely outside of both these categories.\n\nSecond:  the chai.   OMGWTFPOWDERED CHAI.    This is the most disgusting thing I never knew I didn't want to exist.   And for $4, are you kidding me??\n\nThird:   Don't ask about bicycles if you are a novice and the tall dude with the high prescription glasses and the almost dreads is there.   He will look at you with his superior bike knowledge, dismiss your Mom outfit and your moderately priced purse not made of canvas or ripstop with no reflective properties to it whatsoever and treat you like a disdained child who crapped on his floor.     I wanted to research bikes for my kids and this guy is just wildly unapproachable, weird, and haughty, which goes for pretty much most of the staff in there unless you walk in WITH A BIKE HELMET AND SKINNY PANTS.\n\nAlso, bike tires stink when you're hungry."
0,"I'm a big buffet fan, so naturally I got the Buffet Of Buffet's for my most recent trip to Vegas.  I had heard good things about this place and read the reviews here on yelp.  This was our first stop (for breakfast) and we were ready to eat!     \n\nWe were seated quickly, there was no line.  Our hostess was a very kind woman.  The waitress wasn't all that great and really didn't do much other than get my party 1 refill (we were there for about an hour)\n\nAt first glance it seemed like a clean place, and I had hoped the food would be great.  Sadly...it was not.  My first plate was biscuits and gravy, scrambled eggs, and hash browns.  I also grabbed a small bowl of oatmeal.  \n\nThe overall quality of the food was really bad.  The eggs looked fantastic, however they had no flavor and they were very watered down.  The hash browns were cold, and again had no flavor.  I took one bite of the B&G and that was enough to know that I didn't like it.  The oatmeal I will admit though was pretty much as good as oatmeal can be.   \n\nI ordered Milk and I was very surprised that they brought me whole milk and that was pretty awesome, the waitress brought me 2 big glasses, I got a refill on 1 and ordered a chocolate milk, I was disappointed with the chocolate milk as that was not whole milk...it also tasted sour.\n\nI went back to look at the other foods offered, and based off looks alone I wouldn't eat anything else from there other than fruit.  The bacon and sausage looked very undercooked, I have a thing about bacon being cooked crispy, this bacon was floppy and you could see through it, my girlfriend tried both meats and she said it was pretty bad.  I don't recall everything my lady had but she wasn't happy with it.   We left after that. \n\nSo for me, the only good thing about this buffet I liked was the Milk, Oatmeal, and Fruit.  I wouldn't recommend it to anyone at least not for breakfast, though if they can't make breakfast I can't depend on them to make anything else. I gave it a 2 for the way the place looked, and for the high quality milk."
1,Love this pool great place up sun bath and grab a bite and drink always good customer service and can't beat the view
1,I called them to get some work done. But when they were supposed to show up no one showed. We received no phone call or text. \n\nUpdate. They got back to me and were able to be here the next day. Did good work at a good price. I will use them again
0,"This review is on their customer service, specifically towards concierge and security-lost and found.\n\nI had left my ipad charger and realized it shortly after I checked out.\nI went back to the hotel and the concierge had confirmed with me that housekeeping retrieved it but it will take couple hours to get it to lost and found.\nI had to leave Vegas so she took down my number and told me security will contact me and it will be mailed to me, free of charge.\n\nAfter not hearing back from them for a week, I called and now the security tells me nothing was retrieved from the room. but I was specifically told that it had been before. He told me a person will be contacting me to start an inquiry/investigation on it on that day.\n\nOf course not to my surprise, I dont hear from them so I call back again 3 days later and now the lady in security is telling me she does not know of such procedure of starting investigation and maybe i should try calling back to speak to that guy again....\n\nplease get your act together Aria in your service area. \nIts not about the charger. it's about being told one thing and then another the next. and then no follow up. and it's a shame because your rooms and casinos are nice. especially for the price."

Get a clue lady and tell your doucher boyfriend to figure it out. I love pets sure, but not in a public breakfast area hovering over the waffle table."
1,"La Salsa Cantina is buried in the back of the Planet Hollywood's Miracle Mile Shops, but they have great breakfast specials before noon--$3.99 for 2 eggs, potatoes, choice of meat and 2 tortillas and $0.99 bloody marys. The food is simple, but hearty, and the bloody mary is fine (it is only 8 ounces, but for this prices you can get a few).\n\nWe were able to get a seat in the open area at the front of the restaurant, which offers good views of the people passing by, the sport's bar across the walkway, and the small fountain that is choreographed to music. The atmosphere is loud...since you are right by the walkway, but it is very good people watching.\n\nOur service was fine--very quick for as busy as they were and, when asked about a spicy bloody, he brought us extra hot sauce.\n\nI wish I would have discovered this place earlier in my visit to Las Vegas...a great place to start the day and save some cash."
0,We went here to watch a Laker playoff game and enjoy dinner. The food was good but service sucked. After we got our food and one round of drinks our waiter disappeared. We had to take it upon ourselves to get our drinks at the bar. He could have easily racked up a much larger bill and tip had he been more attentive. I was very disappointed.
0,"What a horrible experience!  While my Malai Kofta was acceptable, it tasted reheated (read: slightly dried out and over-cooked.)  Also everyone else in my party who ordered the buffet was disappointed.  Six patrons plus me... all very unhappy.  I chose this restaurant on a recent trip to Tempe to reunite with friends, and I chose it because of the high reviews on yelp.  Is everyone crazy??  The food was just ok, though not remarkable.  What was truly terrible was the service and the ambience.  The server was rude and only checked on us once.  The buffet was not refreshed in the two hours we sat there mingling and nibbling.  The soda that my friends ordered was almost out of syrup, so it was a very light brown and had virtually no flavor.  I am so embarassed!  I chose this place, and everyone was unhappy.  Food was also wasted, which I don't feel good about.  Clean the place up, keep the food fresh and put out a friendly vibe!!!  That's what this place needs to stay in business.  I would NEVER come here again.  What a disappointment!"
0,Your website says 'good for kids'.  Stopped by for lunch on Saturday with wife and young son.  Server quickly met us at door to advise it is a 21 & older establishment.  We left disappointed and won't be back.  Perhaps you should update your website so you don't waste people's time.
0,"I went to the Bonefish grill on Sunday.  I am a fan of the chain since I have had the service in many locations.  So I thought let me try the Charlotte, NC location.  Pros:  1. Brittany my server she was pleasant and attentive to customer needs.  2.  The ambiance is the standard for the chain.  Cons:1.  location.  2.  When I redeemed my born day reward I was surprised about the portions.  The additional food, Cr\u00e8me Brulee French toast I ordered was okay.  I guess after eating the same dish in the NOLA then this was a disappointment.  Mind you last year this time I was in another state and the portions were great.  Next year I will not go to this location and I know I will not be returning to this location.  I had to give it a try and well now you have it, my review that is."
1,"This is a great local place to get anything done.\nI was really nervous about going blonde because I'm a natural brunette and my hair is picky. But Hayley put me at ease and assured me it would look great, and it did! The atmosphere is amazing, and everyone is so nice. My friend and I were offered free muffins and drinks and felt completely comfortable. They even own a cafe and botique next door! This place is awesome, and worth every penny."
1,"I have been taking my son here for 7 years now. The entire staff is always attentive, they typically have appointments available when you call and your child is sick and their physicals have always been very thorough.\n\nI love they have two sides to the their office - sick door and healthy door. They also have Saturday hours at their other location, so that is useful if you need them. \n\nThey do a lot of newborn/new parent education. \n\nThe doctors and staff are always friendly, they truly do like what they do and they do a great job."
1,"Been eating here for a few years now and doesn't get old! Love this place it's great food. Their lunch specials are filling, cheap and delicious! Beats major chain pizza any day. \n\nPlus their TVs usually have sport on :) - I always get the number 3."
1,"The Hofbrauhaus was a lot of fun for me and my parents (my mom's family is from Bavaria, so this is a bit of home cooking for her! What better place to take them?).\n\nAs soon as we walked in, we sat at a huge wooden table and ordered some beers. They were delicious (and huge). A bunch of cute German guys were enjoying some beers and brats in their lederhosen, and eventually, they were subjected to shots and spankings (thanks to one of their friends). Maybe a little too entertaining, but it was a fun time. A three-piece band played Bavarian standards and many of the patrons sang along/danced. A very fun time.\n\nAs for the food, the portions are generous and the flavors are savory and delicious. I had one of my favorites, currywurst. The pretzels are really soft and chewy--perfect with a beer. The prices are moderate, but if you're not starving, I'd say split it with a friend. There's too much to eat, and you can always order more if you're hungry. This was, hands-down, my parent's favorite place we visited in Vegas. We'll be back next time."
1,"Artie provided fantastic service! I called him to replace my broken and clogged garbage disposal and he did a fantastic job. He was prompt, professional, efficient, and reasonably priced. He made sure the repairs were finished completely, and got the job done quickly. I also enjoyed chatting with him. I highly recommend Arties Master Plumbing!"
1,"Wandering about trying to find a place to have a drink and this was the winner. Nice big bar and opened up to the outdoor patio. Very nice and inviting. The place was crowded and I order my standard dirty martini. Bartender Sasha was right on, my tini was made to perfection. She gave us a menu and things did seem pricey but on par with most others. I just felt like drinking and had a 2nd when I spotted the Key Lime Pie and had to have a piece. They brought out this huge piece of pie and I was a happy boy. The first bite made me even happier. It was a case of come near me or touch this pie and we will have issues. Delicious. Between my martini and the pie it was perfect evening. Next time I may have to try some food, but I will have my pie first! Great service, nice atmosphere a must stop."
1,"Went here on a Saturday night at 7pm the place was bizzy with a good buzz about the place, there wasn't any problems atall with the service, we were well looked after by our waitress, the food was great I opted for the fillet steak which was cooked to perfection. we both had 3 courses and 2 btl wine and a btl water and it was \u00a3102 which we thought was quite reasonable for the quality and service we received."
0,"I stayed in this hotel a couple nights and while it wasn't terrible, it still left a lot to be desired. It is in a pretty good location, between Fremont and the activity at the south end of the strip, but you will still need to drive or take a taxi to those areas.\n\nThe room we got was mediocre and did not really have a view of anything other than a wall. There were some stains inside the drawers and the tissue box was never replenished. And on the last night, the shower/bathtub drain clogged!\n\nThere's a $7.50 per night resort fee in addition to the regular charge that is supposed to cover these amenities, but obviously it wasn't enough! This fee also gives you access to the top of the tower, which is listed as a $60 value. This doesn't include the rollercoaster and so all you can do is look around. That's cool and all, but why would it even cost $60 to ride up an elevator? And once was enough.\n\nThe casino part itself is pretty decent, and the buffet is an okay price for being on the strip.\n\nThis is not a bad establishment, but as far as staying over here, it could definitely use some improvements."
0,I dont mind fresh and hot...but when you have to wait 15 minutes to order and another 15 minutes to receive the order plus bad attitude....not a good mix\nTry two cashiers when you got 4 people or more in one line...that would cut the first 15 minutes
1,Tasty dinner with the hubby. Definitely want to come back to experience the patio.
0,"What the heck.  \nAs we waited 45 minutes for our car to be washed we noticed a lot of complaints going on. Looks like something may have been stolen out of a couple of cars not exactly sure. We had just come back from Costco bought two things one of them was a gallon of pure maple syrup.  Not a big deal until it goes missing! Who wants maple syrup really! My husband called in the morning to see if maybe it had been in lost and found manager says will look into it call him back.  two days later no call back. Doesn't matter if it's maple syrup, Or something expensive the fact that you can't take your car to get cleaned without having to worry if they're going to steal something is very scary\nOutside as the cars were being cleaned it sounded like there was a competition going on as to how many cars they can get done in an hour.   What a bunch of chaos will not go back!"
0,"We went there at 1:30 pm on a Sunday afternoon and the service was AWFUL!!  We ordered the Italian salad and a pizza. It took them 50 minutes to get our food out to us!   There were people who ordered after us who were getting their lunch.  The place was not busy.  I finally asked if they had lost our ticket, the server was very rude and just said we had a sudden rush.  What?  There were 4 tables outside with people and at the most 5 inside!  I ordered my dressing on the side and of course it came saturated with it along with wilted lettuce!  The pizza was just ok, nothing spectacular.  If you want a GREAT salad and pizza, drive 5 minutes south to Oregano's.  I was very disappointed because the atmosphere was so modern and great!  So, in a nut shell!  The atmosphere is GREAT, the service is lousy and the food is not even \""ok\"". My guess is with all of the places that have great service and excellent food that this place will not be around much longer.  Not even in the same realm as Postino's or LG Orange."
0,"\""SOCIAL STATUS\"" IS BS!\n\nI was concerned with my online order because they had a fire in their Charlotte store and the lady told me over the phone AND email that my order won't be affected because online orders are from the warehouse not their stores. \n\nThen yesterday, they only ship out 1 pair of shoes (Asics GT2 \""Navy/Red\"") that's not very expensive and high in demand. I emailed them about my 2nd pair of shoes, NB M998RO which retailed at $160 - 50% off = $80, and now they tell me \""it's out of stock.\""\n\nI CALL BS ON THEIR FIRE! I believe they started the fire themselves and claiming insurance fraud on most of our orders. They have 4 HUGE stores in North Carolina and Pennsylvania! There's no sneaker community there; there's no way they could've made enough profit to sustain their business. This is my assumption because most people I know had their orders cancelled! They probably used those sales to be included in the damages/lost in the fire. \n\nI'm so disappointed. I gave them the benefit of the doubt and even defended them too."
0,"I've driven past this place many times on the way to Suns or D-Backs games.  Every time I passed by, it looked like a fun place to go hang out.  I finally had the opportunity to do so during a conference in downtown Phoenix.  One of the companies at the conference hosted a party here.\n\nThe party was staged in the patio area as you enter the restaurant.  The company who hosted the party was giving away complimentary Cigars, so I understand why they had it outdoors.  The weather was perfect, so it was a good time of the year to do it.  The place was packed too.  So why the 2 Stars?  Here's why:\n\n- They serve Wine out of a liquor gun....yes, they do.  When I went up to the bar on the patio and asked for a glass of Cabernet, the bartender told me \""You have to go inside because we don't have the handles with the Wine\"".....I thought she was kidding and I said, \""I'm sorry, I don't think you understand, I asked for a glass of Cabernet.  You don't have any bottles back there?\""....that's when she confirmed what I heard and said \""No, you heard me right, we serve Wine out of a handle/line and since we're a smaller bar outside you have to go inside to get it\"".......what the hell?!  The Wine tasted like what you would expect Wine from a tap to taste like...\n\n- The restrooms are like gas station restrooms.  They're located out next to the bars on the patio and they are just like gas station restrooms in that they're too small and dirty.  They couldn't handle the crowd of people at the party.\n\n- Service is slow.  The line at the bar was 30 people deep for each line (2 lines).  There were only 2 bartenders to service 200+ people.  It took 20+ min to get a drink.\n\n- The party felt like a house party in someone's backyard.  Plastic cups, plastic furniture, you had to bus your own table.....there were no buspersons or anyone to clean up.  Bizzaro-world.....\n\nOverall, not a good experience.  Maybe if I was a young 20 yr old it would be cool...not now.\n\nReturn Factor - 5%"
0,"Not busy, and horrible service. Barely any TVs to watch football, unless you like 20\"" screens. Went to the restroom and it was trashed with garbage everywhere. And very over priced, along with not a lot of food selection. Good luck"
0,"This place has tasteless food that is over priced. It is not very far from my house and would be easy to stop at but I choose to go to Suzie's, or Poncho's in Phoenix. If you want good Mexican food do your self a favor and go somewhere else."
1,"Went here last night with my boyfriend. We are slightly new to Las Vegas and I was really craving a burger..like from Chilies or somewhere like that but we neeeed to be trying new places! I remebered driving by Bahama Breeze and hearing good things about it from people. We sat in the bar and we were gonna order a drink but because it was 106degrees outside...we ended up drinking down lots and lots of water. I went for the portabello/manchanga cheese burger and he went for the Cuban Sandwich which made me happy so we could share. I usually lovve any and most syles of the cuban sandwhich. I skipped fries and went for the black bean soup as my side, which was actually delish; they put a splash of some yummy green salsa on top that made this soup perfect. I did try my boyfreind's fris and they were OK, nothing too special but average and tasty. The burger was good, the mushroom and cheese mix on top was awesome! It was very messy tho and I had to cut it in half of course as my his sandwhich came out cut in half and verrry bit. I enjoyed my sandwhich, I just hate when it falls all apart and is all over the place because then I am not getting the full effect of the flovors together. I was eying his sandwhich and finally took a bite, I was not impressed at all....it was slightly dry and was in need of a special mustard of some kind (honey, spicy..something..), it might of had some mayo on it but it just tasted dry, the bread was OK...it was more of a mixed meat pannini sandwhich if you ask me. He did enjoy it but mainly because he was dipping it in his ranch. I actually brought half of it for lunch to work today, added some honey mustard and it was pretty good. The decore in this place is fun, reminds me of Rain Forest Cafe. I would say it is an affordable, family-friendly place that is OK for the food. Our server was great, no issues there. I did see the happy hour menu and will FOR SURE go in for that some time soon but probably just that...1/2 off apps. and cheap fancy drinks. I think it is only Sun-Thurs though. I am looking forward to hitting the happy hour  but think it is more of a family-friendly place with OK food and funky fish/jungle decore."
0,"i like their chicken biryani. That's the only + thing. Their Shahi paneer didn't have any salt in it. Last time when i visited this place during dinner, the water they served me had a hair in it. The server didn't had the courtesy of apologizing. Plus i didn't find the staff to be very courteous."
0,"I went to Blue 32 with a friend a few weeks and had the worst experience. My friend and I stopped in for a quick bite to eat before we saw a movie. While my friend enjoyed the Deep fried Monte Carlo sandwich, I did not enjoy my quesadilla with bacon and shrimp. The bacon was over whelming and i don't think the shrimp was cook properly. I looked around for our waiter and could not find him. Nor track any other worker down to get something else or have it remade. We even wanted to order more drinks and couldn't. Didn't stop once to see how our meal was. The waiter returned after my friend finished his food. I told him what was wrong with my food. He offered to get me something else but I stated no that we were in a rush now for a movie. He brings us the bill and I was charged for a meal I didn't even barely eat. In fact I got home and spent 4 hours in the bathroom sick as a dog. I wanted to contact the restaurant to tell them that they have horrid service but they dont even have a website or a contact email."
0,"Based on other reviews, I may have had higher expectations than I should, but this place is really not very good. Had the carne asada burrito with rice and beans. Carne asada had almost no flavor or char (appeared to be boiled? Yuck!) Which they attempted to mask with guac and pico. Beans and rice were sub par and bland as well. Meal came out in the time it took to fill my soda, which isn't a good sign. \n\nIf you want good, quality, flavorful Mexican food look elsewhere. The only real positive is that it was fast and inexpensive. I won't be coming back."
0,"Ordered the cheese curds ($2) and the five piece dipping fish strips ($3) and somehow got a total of $7 with no explanation- and, after a ten minute wait during 5:00 rush, NO SAUCES with my order. \nThat's right: no ketchup, no tartar sauce, nothing. \nAll of this while the manager was standing by the register watching his staff working and chatting with them, but obviously not helping or correcting their mistakes.\n\nAte the curds and hated myself for it- they were super greasy and half of them were more crunch than cheese. Tried to eat a strip without any dipping sauces (seriously, how did NO ONE in the kitchen notice this?!), and gave up, tossing the order.\n\nNever again. Grab chicken strips next door at Cain's, they have their act together even at midnight. And their sauce is delish."
0,"Bar Smith has great sandwiches for lunch, and a nice rooftop bar open most evenings. Be warned, the place smells like a raw sewer burst open. Hang out for about 15 minutes, and your nose will get used to it and stop noticing. There really isn't anything special about the place, but everything is good. I always have had my eyes on the enormous bottles of grey goose above the bar.\n\nUPDATE - 6-20-08:\n\nWent in last friday to meet up with a friend. He had been there since 4:30 in the afternoon, and now it was 10pm so as you can imagine he was too drunk to really know his surroundings. I walked up and they were frisking everyone who went through the door, and took one look at me and said go ahead... lol. The girl tried to charge me a cover, which I denied and went ahead and went in anyway, as I was not planning on staying longer than what it took to get my buddy out of there. I went in and it was a friggin thug fest. Every Cholo, Ese, and Heina in Phoenix was there. I was the only white guy in the place. It felt very unsafe, even for a guy who grew up in the hood. I will never go back there as long as they are advertising to and accepting this type of clientele. It's unsafe, unsophisticated, and downright embarrasing. \n\nONE STAR!"
1,"I'm a Vegas local and I will admit I'm pretty reluctant to go to the strip just to have a buffet dinner, however I was urged to go. It's pricey, but if you are like me and my boyfriend and can ignore the fact your stomach is telling you \""Stop, enough, please... no more\"" it's worth it. Like most buffets (in my option) this is set up so it's wrapped around the dinning area, I can never find my seat. The only thing that I wasn't too pleased with was I had to wait almost 10 minutes for drawn butter, for my crab legs, which ended up causing a line of people. Everything was wonderful in terms of the food, quality, and service. I will have to say I LOVED our little Italian waiter who delighted us with short stories about NY (where I'm from), even with story time he was quick and efficient as well as super friendly. I wish I remembered his name because he was delightful. Overall a very very good dinning experience especially for a buffet."
1,One of mine and my wifes favorite places on the strip. Many games and places to eat inside many good shows going on all the time fun place.
0,"If I could give negative stars I would. NEVER. EVER. EVER. EAT HERE IF THE SKINNY BLACK GIRL with a tattoo across her chest is working. She has a major attitude problem, and NO CUSTOMER service skills. She's rude and catty and definitely does not know how to treat the people who pay her bills. Not to mention the fact that she doesn't know how to tell the difference of first come first serve. And to blatantly talk about a customer in front of another customer is in bad taste and reflects badly unto the establishment. When asked for a manager she REFUSED to allow me to speak to the manager and refused to give her name. She allowed customers ahead of me to go without paying because she was too lazy to find the server who took their order.  Don't come here if you're in a hurry or you see this particular girl working. She's a horrible employee."
1,"Ya know whats weird, I'm not even a big coffee drinker and I swear by this place.  Their facebook posts crack me up.  The cleanliness is astonishing and when I go there I feel like I'm at home. Its cozy and welcoming and the staff is so pleasant. I love the hot apple cider and every coffee drink I've had is tasty.  Well done all around."
0,"Long wait at lunch. 5 min just to acknowledge I was waiting. Hostess running table tickets, takeout orders and seating tables.\n\nStrange when I'm already eating with chopsticks the server comes over to ask if I want a fork??? WTH? I wonder what kind of reaction I'd get asking a group of Asians eating with forks if they'd like chopsticks?\n\nOrdered beef and broccoli. Tried to substitute fried rice for the steamed rice but no can do. Hint people. Figure out how much additional the same amount of fried rice is and ADD THE ADDITIONAL CHARGE. Telling a customer no you can't do it will ensure one thing: the customer goes somewhere they will. Try visiting other restaurants and see how they do it.\n\nSo I got my lunch they way they wanted me to have it. Result? Loss of additional revenue and an unhappy customer. I guess not all business owners actually have business sense.\n\nTwo stars only because the food is good. Not great, but good. The service and flexibility to the customer is substandard."
0,"The world could use more small-time museums, but it's a tough road for those with modest endowments and only a niche market. One thing that cartooning has going for it, however, is that it lends itself very nicely to a gallery space. Toonseum is not very big, but I enjoyed my one visit here.\n\nThat said, in 2011 I contributed to a modest Kickstarter campaign they promoted to help raise funds for a new gallery, and judging by the comments on their Kickstarter page, I am pretty sure I wasn't the only backer that wasn't sent a promised reward. Subsequent messages went unanswered. That left a pretty sour taste in my mouth. Someone in the organization really laid an egg."
0,"I had been craving a milkshake from sonic for weeks, I finally went and got one today! The guy didn't put the lid on all the way, MILK SHAKE EVERYWHERE!!!! All the guy did was offer more napkins! Half of my milkshake spilled out. I even paid more to get extra pie crust in the shake...I et to work to get and my order is completely wrong! It's not brain surgery people!!!!"
0,"We were headed to a Pirates game and looking for somewhere new to eat when we found Mullen's. It sits extremely close to PNC, and all of the reviews stated the food was good but service was \""meh\"". We decided that since a lot of times people use reviews to complain and not praise that we'd give it a shot anyway, we're not a difficult group to please and we really like bar food.\n\nOur experience was horrible. \n\nThe waitress wasn't helpful at all when we were trying to join two tables so our group of six could sit together, and no the place wasn't that busy. The waitress took our drink orders after we managed to join two tables together and brought our drinks back fairly quickly, and returned a few minutes later to take our food orders. After a decent amount of time two different waitresses brought out our food, but got an order wrong so had to fix it. It took about 15 minutes for the order to be fixed, and again a different waitress brought it out. Our original waitress did come back once and fill two of our drinks and then seemed to disappear. We finished eating at 4:30, and made it noticeable that we were done. I did see our waitress a few times, but she blatantly ignored our table and stayed mainly in the bar area. At 5:00 I flagged down a waiter and asked for our checks since our waitress hadn't been seen, he removed some of our plates and said he'd find her. We finally got our checks at 5:20, almost an hour after we had finished eating. We waited for a few minutes for her to come back and take our money but when she didn't return we left cash on the table and left. \n\nNone of us liked doing that and we are all appreciative of good service and tip well, but this was the worst service at a bar I had ever had. \n\nThe food was good, I had a chicken gyro and fries, others had the wings, nachos, or burgers, and we all enjoyed our meals even though they were a bit pricy. I think I'd almost rather have a lackluster meal with good service than an enjoyable meal with bad service. The atmosphere was good, the music was a bit loud but I am not a big fan of loud music while eating so that could just be me being picky. \n\nI won't be returning to Mullen's unless I see it on an episode of Restaurant Stakeout first."
1,"this place has one of the best setups to see a race ever. and mixing drag racing with vegas has just gotta be awesome.\n\namazing views, and it's right next to the air force base so you have fighters flying overhead the entire time.\n\nbeer, gambling, drag racing, and flybys. america.......f*ck yeah."
0,"I ordered a BLT on rye.  When it arrived it even looked unappetizing.  I sent it back and the replacement was not much better.  This time the bacon was only overlooked and dry, instead of actually burned.  The bread wasn't replaced, and was dried out.  The 2 slim slices of tomato were, well,ugly.\n\nI understand their ad for new cooks and wish them well.  The services was also ho-hum."
1,"I'm new to the Scottsdale area and have been putting off going to get my hair done since I left Bellevue, WA where salons are great there. After many visits to other salons to see if I would give them a try, none of them even came close to earn my trust. Modern Hair Junkie was exactly what it sounded like \""Junkie\"". Dolce was way over price and too snobby. So out of desperation I asked my trusted eyelash extension expert, Itgirldiva-Sherene, for a reccommendation. She said I had to go see Eric because he was Mr.Scissorhand. And best of all, all the products there are organic. No yucky chemicals that I can't even pronounce going into my hair. \nAll I can say after my appointment was, WOW! The staff and Eric are down to earth. Their lounge is comfortable and classy without all the pretentious BS. And all the products even though they are organic, smells amazing. Even after the next morning, my hair still smells and feels great. The difference between great products really makes a difference that you can see and feel.\nI had to take my husband there to get his haircut too. Being the man, he hates to go to places like this for his haircut. But after Eric was done, he loves it and will never go back to just a barber to cut his hair again. Eric skills and methods is even great for men's cut. We love this place."
1,"Yes, I will agree with some of the other posters in that Casey's has a definite crowd and can be a little pretentious at times but over all it's a fun place to be. Enjoy the scene if you're into it and if not enjoy the people watching. Maybe if we all just smiled a little bit, those hipsters wouldn't be so emo...haha, just kiddin. I've gone in to Casey's and attempted to meet new people; been looked at like a crazy and also have met some cool ones as well. It's location is close to many things in Tempe, which makes it a favorite spot for bike riders. Ride your favorite two-wheeled friend down there and strike up a convo with other enthusiasts, because a bike friendly world is a happy world. \n\nI've never really had any problems with the staff, minus pouring me too stiff of drinks(their Irish coffee especially). It does tend to get extremely crowded nights on the weekends which can lead to slower service but that's what good company is for. Head inside to the bar, grab your first round, find a seat out on their wonderful patio and wait for your waiter for the next round. simple. \n\nI don't really dig their food too much. I feel they dress it up saying it's an \""oyster house\"" but really its just bar food. I tend to eat at home or somewhere else and just have this as a drinking joint. Otherwise I feel greasy and gross afterwards. I will say their portions are good enough to share."
1,"Good croissant sandwich, cute place. Great service, nice people."
1,"I have eaten here twice and highly recommend it if you're a fan of savory bagels.\nThe first time I went here I had an everything bagel with cream cheese and a coffee. Both were very good. They have quite a few coffee options: 6 coffees and various creamers/milks, including vanilla half and half, which I used. I got my friend an egg and cheese on a bagel and everything seemed to be made fresh. \n\nI would not rate them 4 stars for the blueberry bagel I tried the next visit (though the strawberry cream cheese was very good). The coffee was, once again, very good. They also do free refills on the coffee, which is pretty fantastic. This time, I ate there and noticed they have some really interesting cream cheese flavors that I look forward to trying on future visits. \n\nThe service was really nice both times. The people working here were enjoyable and the food was ready quickly."
1,Went here with friend and boy am I glad we chose this place! The decor is awesome. Food is exceptional and the DJ plays great music that is not overpowering. I will definitely back. This place is great for any occasion.
1,"I can't recommend this shop highly enough.  The small local dealer where I bought my BMW recommended them to me and I'm so glad they did!  Local family owned shop, and everyone there lives & breathes BMWs.  Very reasonable labor rates, friendly and approachable environment, they remember your name, and aren't trying to rack up your bill.  The only downside is no \""free\"" car wash like at the dealer - but I'd rather pay $10 for the car wash around the corner than suffer through jacked up rates and shenanigans at the dealer service bay.  I love this little shop and totally trust them with my car!"
0,The owner is a condescending unpleasant person who belittles his customers. The food has been on a steady decline for a number of years and is getting worse by the day.  stay far away from this money pit! unless you want to waste money on bad food and a horrible experience.
0,"So the majority of my food was good here, appetizer (King Edward Mussels), dessert (sorbet) but the main course I ordered: soba noodle was horrible. It was way to salty which overwhelmed all other flavours.  Normally I would give a place a second chance, but this is soba we are talking about the namesake of the restaurant.  For this price, I would expect excellent food and great atmosphere which this place has failed to deliver."
0,"Underwhelmed by my daytime visit for food- the location is lit like a nightclub 24/7, even at 11AM on a Sunday when all I wanted was to satisfy a killer wing craving. \n\nStaff was polite, wait time for a to-go order was reasonable. Had time to sit and look around, liked the lighting effects and modern d\u00e9cor/seating, but found it odd that they don't have more lights on during the day or anything to make it a little more restaurant-like for non-nightclub hours. Free wifi, lots of regulars on laptops.\n\nFood itself was mediocre: 12 piece spicy garlic wings had no spice or garlic, for 12 wings we were given 2 tiny cups of ranch- stingy.  Beef shish kabob meat was dry and wrap had no sauce, side of Caesar salad was bagged at an angle so the dressing dripped out of the box and all over the bag.\n\nEDIT: Subtracted an additional star after a traffic incident with an employee in a company truck covered in HML contact info and logos. He was speeding, tailgating, and nearly sideswiped my car in 5 o'clock traffic about a block away from the lounge. Dangerous on it's own, unprofessional when representing your company. I would have given them another chance before, now I won't be."
1,"I LOVE this resort!  I have stayed there many times and never been disappointed. Truly a paradise in Paradise Valley...beautiful rooms, friendly staff, fun bar (and funny bartenders) yummy cocktails and food, not to mention the amazing views.  Can't wait to stay there again.    \nOh...and the Spa Suites have outdoor soaking tubs, perfect way to end the day."
1,"Definitely one of the better coffee shops around the area. I got their cappuccino which was very smooth and rich, and my friends really seemed to enjoy the hot chocolate as well.  Their americano was very strong, which is the way I like mine.  I love that they play a variety of music and don't stick to just one genre, and the decor is vintage yet modern.  It's a nice place to go by yourself to study, or with friends for a chat.  The owner is very friendly- we discussed whether a zebra-donkey is called a zonkey or a debra. I only wish that this place was open longer!"
1,"I have had a lot of fun here but I think I'm quitting playing poker. I've won and lost thousands and thousands of dollars in this poker room. I've lost track of whether I'm up or down in winnings. Poker room here offers high hand bonus such as four-of-kind for $100 bonus, straight flush for $250 and the Royal Flush progressive jackpots. Spades, Hearts, Clubs and Diamonds all have different payouts. Look at the monitor screen to see how much is paying if you hit the Royal. If anyone makes a royal over $5K then all players in that table receive $200 on the house.\n\nI do consume some alcohol once gambling and the single beautiful women I see walk by is very distracting which doesn't help. On many occasions, I have gotten up from the poker table while being in a hand just to talk to women haha no lie.\n\nYou really can't tell if some of these girls are \""working\"" the fact that every girl you see inside a casino is pretty much wearing the same mini bitty sexy dress with high heels. In conclusion, the dealers here are cool and conversational. It's a nice small poker room with a view. You also get to hear great music play in the Heart Center Bar which makes you feel like you're in a club in a way. I would recommend Planet Hollywood poker room to anyone wanting to try a few hands of poker."
0,"I've been going to this giant eagle since i was a kid. there's no excuse for the company not to improve the parking and ease of navigation of this location given what i can only imagine is its tremendous profitability. in fact, the only reason it is so profitable is due to its great location and the neighborhood. the store is dirty, cramped and can't compete with other giant eagles, the strip, whole foods, trader joe's etc. for variety and freshness. the employees are totally useless, as is the manager who works nights. avoid."
0,"I can not express  enough on how horrible this business is! STAY FAR AWAY FROM THIS PLACE!!!!! Please do your research before financing a car through CAG, you have other options when it comes to financing  and this place should not be one of them.  Save your money before buying a car. I am not just saying this because I am angry, it is the complete truth! The cars are horrible and their system they have in place for payments is god awful. Very unprofessional and not customer service friendly."
1,"This cafe is really quaint, and quiet. The atmosphere is very welcoming. There isn't many places to sit when it's busy, but there is some outdoor seating for nicer weather. It's located near where I live, and the food is pretty satisfying. Their sandwiches use waffles as their bread. I never would have thought that it would taste so good! I got a regular waffle with strawberries, banana, whipped cream and chocolate sauce. Pretty typical desert waffle. Nothing out of the ordinary, but the waffles were really crispy on the outside, fluffy on the inside and not too sweet. Exactly what a waffle should be. We'll be returning here for sure."
1,"Great meal. period. great service, we had the degustation menu and could not finish any of the courses even though we wanted to ! Go and you will be glad you did ."
0,"I have conflicted feelings about Palazzo's and you will soon see why.  Walking in on a Wed night solo, I was greeted by a very warm (albeit empty) old-school Italian restaurant.  I sat and the beautiful marble bar and immediately the cordial bartender Larry, was at my beck and call.  I ordered a Beefeater Gibson martini up, and he seemed very happy to make one; not too many Gibsons are made these days.\n\nHe was very pleasant and made an excellent drink.  Since the place was pretty empty, the manager was also in the bar chatting about Pittsburgh, sports, politics, and also was very friendly.  I went with my order: started with the escarole with beans, followed by a stand-by spaghetti & meatballs.\n\nThe escarole portion was large and almost like a stew; nicely cooked leaves of escarole mixed with a spicy tomato sauce and a good amount of cannellini beans.  It was excellent, satisfying and could well stand as a meal on its own.  I then proceeded to have the worst pasta I've ever had in a restaurant.  The spaghetti tasted and looked like it came from Chef Boyardee.  The sauce was flavorless and bland.  The noodles were cooked light years beyond al dente and were mushy, starchy and awful.  The meatballs were decent, but the pasta was so bad filet mignon couldn't have saved them.\n\nI really want to give Palazzo's another shot since the service, staff, ambience and escarole were fantastic.  But to screw up such a simple and classic dish I am worried about how some of the more complicated items will come out."
1,"food is awesome. can be a bit crowded during lunch - can't blame them, they have good food with reasonable price. so why not 5 stars? 1 star is deducted from our angry server, who seemed like she hated what she's doing."
1,"I've been here twice - first time in summer when we sat at the outdoor terrace, and the second time in winter when we were all seated indoors. \n\nObviously a popular place looking at the lunch crowd. Food is very savory. Amongst us, we had the duck risotto, salmon tartare and the grilled scallops - all delectable. \n\nAmbience is pretty much what you'll expect in a bistro downtown. Service was pleasant and fast."
0,"If this is the location inside the Wal-Mart, I would rather crawl across broken glass and then dive into a pool of rubbing alcohol, than eat at this location again. The managers are terrible on a good day. The employees couldn't care less about their job. The fries taste like they've been fried, frozen and then re-fried. They are horrible. EVERY TIME I GO THERE. Last time I went (my husband actually went...I was just standing there in silent protest), the manager and employees were taking pictures of each other with their cell phones. My husband stood there at the register for quite a bit while they finished screwing around, then the cashier (whose name I don't know because none of them wear name tags) reluctantly came over to help. I got the feeling he was annoyed that we interrupted him and his buddies... The husband got his food and before we made it out of the parking lot (thankfully), we realized the order was wrong and the fries were stale. Again. I so hate this location. Now I insist we go across the parking lot to the stand-alone one."
1,Dr. Greenberg is very helpful and knows his stuff. The staff are always friendly and the prices are very reasonable if you are cash pay. Definitely would recommend this dermatologist. They have a lot of products and services. Great location. And scheduling is usually really flexible.
0,"This is worth going to for the experience.  Read a little about how to find it, but don't study the directions.  Get lost trying to find this place, it is half the fun.\n\nThe pizza is ok, but it is counter pizza that needs to be heated up."
1,"I called here to see about bringing my bike in to get the chain tightened.  I spoke to Dan and he let me know that the guy who does that stuff is on vacation so it would take longer than normal for it to get done.  I was fine with that so brought my bike down.  When they inspected it, found out I need a new chain and sprocket.  The guys were nice and let me know it could take a couple days and I was ok with that.  I wasn't in a big hurry.\n\nCalled a couple days later to find out status and they said should be done the next day, which it was.  Got a call first thing in the morning that it was ready.  Went to pick it up and spoke with Travis.  He was nice and helpful and I didn't feel taken advantage of or anything since I am a woman.  He went and got my bike and Dan came out to make sure I got helped and we sat and talked for a little bit.  They let me know what I need to do to keep the chain up.\n\nI never felt like your the stupid girl, don't know what your doing etc..  Dan made me feel very comfortable and even said if the chain loosens a bit, which it may, just stop by and he will get it done right away.  This def helps me want to come back because I don't need guys feeling the can scam the girl.  Being helpful, trustworthy, and explaining the issue is what matters.  I can tell when your being fake.  Will def recommend this place and come back when needed."
1,Awsome pizza my girl says its better then grimaldi's heading there now for some pizza and wings and a large Newcastle
0,"We pulled over to grab lunch here this weekend based solely on the appearance... It looked like it would be great!\nTheir menu didn't seem that unique, but the girl who took our order was extremely friendly and offered some advice on her favorites, which included a pita and for both of us to get sides of the pasta salad. For 2 people to have lunch, I though $19 was a little steep, but we tried to stay optimistic as we found a place to sit. The environment was great- roomy, clean, bright, colorful. When our food was brought to us, my pita already was torn all the way down, so there was no way I was going to be able to manuever eating it with my hands. I probably should have said something, but instead just went up and asked for a fork and a knife. \nFlavors were good, nothing special. Chicken was dry, and the pasta salad was nothing I would write home about. \nWe left full, somewhat pleased, but could have had the same experience for half the price."
0,"Dear Tempe Marketplace,\n\nThis is the most upsetting place I can think of in my immediate vicinity. If I ever commit suicide, it will be here.\n\nYou really are an easy target, aren't you? \n\nYour \""authentic\"" restaurants of every variety aren't fooling anyone.\n\nDon't get me started on the unwalkable parking lot that I'm forced to traverse in order to hit Target and the Coffee Bean in the same trip. \n\nAnd for fuck's sake, stop playing '90s top 40 songs in the parking lot. At earsplitting levels. If I wanted to listen to Matchbox 20, I'd do it at home, alone, in total shame, like a normal person. \n\nWaste of space, waste of resources, waste of time.\n\nBut I'll totally be back next week when I need TP or want to see a movie, k? \n\nSee you then!\nSara"
0,"Completely disappointing. I had my doubts when we had trouble finding the place at night because the only sign they have is wooden with an inscription of a bowl in it.\n\nThen we get inside. It looks pretty nice, that kind of urban hipster looking with a bar that seems pretty popular these days. Being the decisive people we are we order with relatively alacrity and then proceed to wait close to 20 minutes for our appetizer and then another 20 minutes for our entree. This is completely unacceptable, how long can it take to prepare a bowl of ramen?\n\nAs for the taste, the pork belly appetizer was pretty good though I found it kind of skimpy on the pork and really, how do you mess up pork belly?  Our bowls of ramen on the other hand were atrocious; muddy looking broth, a little too salty and basically no other flavor except a bitter aftertaste.  The pieces of meat were equally flavorless and boring.\n\nThe service however was good and when we complained the manager came out to get our opinions. Frankly, the food was beyond redemption, no amount of critiquing was going to allow the chef that prepared that ramen to cook something delicious."
1,Great change of pace from the usual fare! The the Falafel with Tahini app is fantastic!
0,"I am an artist and have been looking for an outlet type store for buying frames.  This store claims to be an outlet.  I spoke with a woman who told me this is their factory and they build and supply frames to their Hall of Frames stores throughout the valley.

Then she proceeded to show me the frames they carry and how I can get 25% - 40% off.  I was NOT impressed.  I am getting 40% off of an exorbitant price.  No thank you.

1,"I thought it was time to write about the amazing facial I had at Life Spa with Bethany. \n\nMy skin felt great from all the wonderful products, my shoulders and scalp felt great from the awesome massage, and my wallet felt great from using my new member ticket!\n\nEveryone was very kind and professional -- from the girl that greeted me to Bethany to the girl at the front desk who asked me how everything went. \n\nTwo things I thought were really great:\n1) Life Spa doesn't use bottled water. They instead offer you filtered water in a real glass. I dislike those mini bottled waters and I think they taste worst than filtered water. \n\n2) My scalp massage. My brain felt like it was on vacation for the entire facial. So relaxing and so wonderful."
1,"Cafe Rio has to have the best chicken burritos there! Everything is so fresh and full of flavor! I get me burrito enchilada style and I definitely recommend that. Everything is fresh and made by hand, like their flour and corn tortillas. Definitely one of my fave places!..:)"
0,"Worst place ever. Homeless live behind the dumpsters. I had an ant problem and several leaks; one case my whole apartment flooded when I was washing my clothes and I woke up to the washer overflowing. I was kicked out of my apartment for 4 days, it was that bad.  Cheap inside and out. Look elsewhere. Only good thing about this place is they give away free rattler tickets. \n\nI feel sorry for the next person who moves Into my old apartment, nothing but trouble. \n\nKEEP LOOKING."
0,Okay buffet. I was had a hangover and didnt have much of a appetite. Ate one small plate. We came as lunch was still being converted. Breakfast was all your typical items. Lunch had Pho. Dessert was lots of variety. $23 or so but we was in a group so got hit with gratuity and tax. Came to about $30. One plate for $30. Sounds good haha
1,"Penang.. Where have you been all my life? I was a Malaysian food virgin until i stumbled upon this place.  \nDelicious food, clean space, and friendly service. \n\nRoti Canai - light crispy and doughy bread served with a side of curry \n                      dipping sauce with chicken and  \n                      potatoes..FANTABULOUS!\n\nHainan Chicken - steamed delicate chicken that has a ginger soy \n                                sauce.. with coconut jasmine rice.. delish\n\nSo many other things to try there.. but all have been great.  The best way to describe Malaysian food is a hybrid of Indian and Thai food.  For some reason my japanese palate and this cuisine get along real well.  \n\nI love desserts and they have some interesting ones. \n\nSeek this place out.. it's incredible!"
1,"I'm sure there are similar places where I live in the Chicago area, but this was a great find, courtesy of my wife's uncle.  A lively atmosphere, a lot of groups out for lunch on a Friday, and several families with kids like us.\n\nThe food was hot, quickly served and the waitress was very helpful and friendly.  I created my own burger and the burger itself was cooked exactly as I like, and the choices for toppings-condiments, cheeses, rubs/coatings-were varied from the basic to the slightly adventurous.  Homemade chips with the burger were good.\n\nEveryone around us had milk shakes and the options on those were interesting and they all looked good.  Looking at the reviews/photos now, wish I would have tried the six napkin nachos-maybe next time!"
0,"Although I love the prices at wal-mart. This place is jammed packed full of people, which is great. My only complaint is the lack of cashiers. Why am I standing in line for 20 minutes to pay for my grocerys when there are about ten registers that can open, and this is every single time!!!  At target I'm in and out."
1,"A friend from out of town wanted to eat there so a group of us went here last night. When we got there there was a table open and we were seated immediately but there was a line outside while we were eating. The food was very good, everyone liked it. It was not the best I have ever eaten but still very good. The portions were not large but enough I didn't leave hungry either. Service was reasonable but not great. Considering this is a fairly small place and it was extremely busy I cannot complain. Overall it was a good experiance and we left happy."
1,"I have not experienced anything but the BEST food every time I go to Pura Vida. I have brought my Father, who refuses to give up meat, and my Mother, who is extremely picky, and this is the one place we can all eat without one complaint. The food is always gorgeous, but I can never get a shot of it without a bite mark because it smells awesome.\nI recently tried the cafe con leche and it was the smoothest, yummiest coffee I've had in my 31 years. I don't know how she does it, but Starbucks doesn't even come close. \nEach time I have come, I have noticed that Chef Mayra takes time to come out and personally speak with her guests, first time I have ever met the person making my food which I really enjoyed. The place is tucked away, but once you find it, I promise you will remember how to get back."
1,"pretty cool drinks and good food! Was craving breakfast, but got there a few minutes after 12pm and had to stick with their regular menu( breakfast is served 6am to 11am, which doesn't make any sense in Vegas, but oh well, i am not the one to judge:) and a candy store in front of the restaurant - amazing:))"
1,"Great food, great prices, awesome portions. They delivered the food within the window they gave us, super friendly, the delivery guy also brought a 100 count box of tea, \"" stating merry Christmas.\"" From now on this will be the only place I get Chinese food from..."
0,"Absolutely the worst service I have ever experienced. 3 times in one meal we were brought the wrong order and then the waitress forgot to put in my entree order! Are you kidding me? I will be going to the location on 27th ave and bell from now on, And that is only if I ever come back to native..."
0,"Uck... what a disgusting place. \n\nI don't know why it is so hard for them to keep this place clean, or things working, but every time I have come here, things like the soda fountains are not working, and the bathrooms are just horrendous. No wonder I don't go out to movies very often!"
0,"My mom and I have been going to this place since it first opened.   Really enjoyed it when the previous owner were in place and went often.  It's a cute little wine bar.\n\nRecently, however, we had a bad experience.  We went in at 5:55 pm (happy hour is over at 6 pm) and the new owner (also acting as waitress) was serving others.  I didn't want to miss a happy hour prices, so I went up to the bar, where I waited some more.  By the time that the owner was ready to serve me, it was 6:01 pm.  When I asked about happy hour prices, she told me \""Sorry, computer says 6:01 pm, there's nothing I can do about it.\""  Lady, you are the OWNER, you can override that!  There's nothing worse than poor customer service.  She could have made our day by offering happy hour prices for those first drinks, but instead she was SO rude about it.  Truly left a bad taste in my mouth.  If I was an owner of a restaurant, I would bend over backwards to make customers happy and that's what she should have done here.  I don't know if we'll be back - I'd rather go somewhere that knows how to treat a customer."
1,"I think I liked this one the best out of all the buffets we visited (MGM, Cravings, and Aria). I've still got my fair share to try but I'm getting there!!\n\nThings that stood out: \n\nRamen! Not only was it awesome to watch them cook it, but it was absolutely delicious. \n\nIndian curries- delicious!\n\nCrab legs- They're everywhere but they were great. \n\nBaby sliders- Juicy and fresh! They were also small, which is a good thing!\n\nRoasted Veggies- random right? But they were seasoned very well and weren't too soft. \n\nThe little bowls that had an array of soups/ pasta dishes/gumbos- The presentation is so nice! \n\nThe green chili chicken with rice- the chicken was juicy, not dry, and the rice was delicious as well. It was hard not to eat too much! I needed to save room for more options \n\nMochi- so awesome!!! \n\nDesserts- There were a ton, and they were, for the most part, all amazing and delicious. \n\nI also like how you can almost get lost. The food kind of wraps around the wall and it just keeps going and going and going. In the middle close to the entrance is the dessert bar which is an entire circle filled with heavenly treats."
0,Rude staff... Way over prized. Spent $60 on two drinks and two servings....
1,"Located right in St-Henri Rasoi is a restaurant that focuses on Indian fusion.  They have plenty of dishes that are considered traditional Indian food but they also have a few that combine Indian cuisine with that of another country.  Prices are reasonable for the area.\n\nThe decor is Indian-inspired but also very warm and inviting.  Upon entering the restaurant we were greeted by a very friendly host who seated us immediately.  Our waitress was also efficient and welcoming.  The only minor complaint I have is that after our main dishes were cleared we weren't asked if we wanted dessert, coffee or tea and we had to flag her down to get the bills.\n\nTo start I had Street Cart Spring Rolls which were traditional spring rolls with an Indian twist.  They had been seasoned with curry which was different but added a nice touch.  I topped it off with a naan pizza which was loaded with tandoori chicken, yogourt, cheese and onions.  The pizza was quite heavy but I really liked the chicken on it.  Most restaurants play it safe with the spice but these guys don't and I like that!\n\nThey have happy hour specials on beer and wine seven days a week.  We were able to split a bottle of wine for $30 which was pretty reasonable.  Also take note that the restaurant was fairly packed so it is best to play it safe and reserve (which you can easily do from the Yelp app FYI)."
1,"I luv this place!  It always satisfies and the wait staff is super friendly!\n\nMy favorites:\nLobster Grilled cheese\nSteamed Clams\nClam Chowda\nFried Calamari\nOyster Rockefeller\nCiopinno\nCrab Cakes\n\nYou come into this place and think - hmm ok a quick bitenothing too fancy, you place your name in and wait patiently - as you get seated you get a great view of the people passing by - SUPER GREAT PEOPLE WATCHING SPOT! You are greated right away and the waiter gets your drinks and delicious warm bread and butter. \n\nI absolutely luv the lobster grilled cheese here- you almost crave it - if you have it - lobster so sweet and the cheese complimenting every bite- this is  a must have!\n\nThe crab legs are always good here, i don't know what they do to them but its a sweet salty combo when eating them. \n\nOyster Rckefeller, hmm last time I ate something this great was at the ACME Oyster house in New Orleans (which is a must as well) - super d lish full of flavor and just melts into your mouth - i could probably eat about 2 dozen of these by themselves!\n\nI tried the steamed clams in white wine sauce, these were okay - a bit smaller than what I had expected. but still real good.\n\nAnother must have, my friend had the Ciopinno and it was to die for! super flavorful and jsut everybite  the flavor jumped out even more!\n\nThe prices were as you would expect in a seafood resaraunt not cheap but not too expensive. \n\nI will of course be back to tantalize my taste buds!"
1,"Best falafel I've ever had. The atmosphere is fantastic and it's in my favorite neighborhood in Charlotte. This is my favorite restaurant to visit when I'm in Charlotte. Now, there is a rather simple reason for not giving it three stars. For an establishment that serves so much alcohol, it's rather unfortunate that the grill closes at midnight. Maybe it's because I'm not a local, but I'm not used to that but, aesthetically, the place looks like more of a diner than a bar, so I expected to be able to stop here after the other bars were closed. I feel that it's bad for business, but good for the employees. Heh. Either way, I'll keep coming back."
1,"Nice stay, staffs are wonderful, free internet, breakfast every day and best of all, from Monday to Thursday evenings, free drinks."
1,"Thank you Tryst for making my first Vegas club experience an unforgettable one. \n\nThe beautiful waterfall offers an ambiance of both an indoor and outdoor setting with a whiff of fresh air when you need it without actually stepping out. Whoever came up with this idea.. You rock!\n\nThe drinks were strong enough to give me a good buzz, probably because it was my birthday weekend so the drinks kept coming and the buzz kept going! Cheers to another amazing night in Vegas!"
1,EVERYTHING on the menu is phenomenal!\nThis is the kind of place where you quickly become a regular. The family that runs the restaurant is super friendly and great with faces and names.\nTry the coffee with condensed milk...it's dreamy and the perfect way to end a fantastic meal!
0,"If I could give them 0 stars I would.  I live in a second story apartment building and have had many packages delivered by On Trac, EVERY single time, they have THROWN my packages up onto my balcony (the only way to get to my balcony unless you're inside my apartment). I have contacted the company at least 3 times on the phone and at least 2 times in writing, and each time I'm told the \""manager\"" of the driver will talk to them.  Well apparently the driver truly only cares about a pay check.  I come from the generation you EARN your money,well not this company, they just get paid to drive around and THROW people's things around that THE CUSTOMERS pay good money for!!!  WORST delivery company EVER!!!!!!\n\nI will definitely be seeking other methods of shipping."
0,"I have had this place bookmarked for a few months and we decided to do takeout last night.  I had high hopes based on a majority of reviews but was so disappointed.\n\nWe ordered;\n the White Pizza ( mozzarella, ricotta, and parmesan cheeses with fresh saut\u00e9ed spinach and garlic).  It looked very appetizing but to me it had no distinctive flavor and seemed bland.  The crust was nice.\n\nFresh Tomato, Basil and Garlic  Pizza  (Fresh sliced Roma tomatoes, mozzarella cheese, fresh garlic and basil, topped with parmesan cheese).  Once again, the presentation was great but it was also on the bland side.  The crust was good.\n\nEggplant Parmigiana Dinner- (Layered eggplant with mozzarella cheese and tomato sauce).  It also came with a generous portion  of Fettuccine Alfredo (although there were other choices) and hot Italian bread.  The alfredo sauce had a weird (not bad-just weird) aroma but it was tasty.  \n\nMy husband liked the alfredo & Eggplant Parm much better then the pizza. He thought the pizza was good but nowhere near Amore's (his fave). \n\nThere is too many other places to get pizza and Italian food in our area so I doubt we would return but I think the potential is there.  Maybe it was just an off night."
0,"I thought everyone's opinion made this a safe place to live it up..... Wrong.\n Didn't try the food, thank God, as the small house payment for two coffees smaller than a senior cup at McDonalds was horrifying enough!\n As we waited for our coffee every employee in the place approached us at least twice to try to seat us. Not in a solicitous way, more of a creepy, boss stalker way.\n Wouldn't go back for a free crepe, luckily I don't think they would offer. A crepe is probably more costly than most vacations.\n It tasted ok, but was $9 for what was seriously less than 1/2 cup TOTAL coffee in two cups.\n Even the server apologized that my tiny cup was mostly empty. I think cocaine us cheaper."
1,The food is always so good and the staff works hard to take care of you even though they are always slammed. The only issue is the noise level. Also the rosemary on the fries... But that is just my preference :)
